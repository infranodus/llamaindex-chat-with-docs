Projects outcomes will enable achieving the expected impacts of the destination by increasing access to primary raw and secondary raw materials, in particular critical raw materials for EU industrial value chains and strategic sectors.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Improve supply chain data transparency and traceability;
Set up technological solutions for tracking raw material flows (material passports);
Identify and address gaps in due diligence;
Develop comparable criteria, reporting and audit approaches;
Sustainable sourcing of raw materials;
Contribute to the implementation of the following actions of the EU Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials: Action 4 - Map the potential supply of secondary critical raw materials from EU stocks and wastes and identify viable recovery projects.[1]
Scope:
There is a need to improve supply chain data transparency and traceability, enabling consumers and downstream producers to have information about the origins of metals in finished products. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, it is advised to involve industrial users from the downstream side. Due diligence has numerous research gaps in this area which need to be addressed in order to limit complexity and enable a level playing field for responsible sourcing of minerals.
This action should close those gaps by the setting up of technological solutions for tracking raw material flows (material passports), building upon comparable criteria, reporting and audit approaches. Examples would include transparency in payments and traceability from beginning to end of the supply chain, through a chain of custody certiﬁcation, and the use of block chain technology in an eﬀort to improve supply chain transparency and traceability.
The action should build on the experience of existing EU projects on international responsible sourcing and contribute to strengthening responsible sourcing agenda.
It is foreseen that this will facilitate responsible sourcing in complex supply chains and put companies downstream in the supply chain in a better position to inﬂuence companies upstream.
The proposal should build on the state of the art in sustainable raw materials traceability with regard to sustainability certification schemes, standards and initiatives as well as block chain technology. The proposal should also build on the experience from earlier Horizon 2020 projects in the area of responsible sourcing of raw materials in global value chains. The proposal should cover CRMs in at least five complex supply chains, including a batteries value chain.
The action should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU about the importance of raw materials for society and of the challenges related to their sustainable supply.

Scope:
Actions should contribute to applying, adapting and eventually developing big data technologies and Artificial Intelligence methodologies addressing mining industry requirements to deliver on the climate ambition of the European Green Deal. The challenge is to accelerate the innovation in the mining sector necessary for the digital transformation. Actions should aim to develop new, enabling, operational solutions to improve capabilities and performance of the raw materials value chain: from in situ mineral exploration and permitting procedures, to mineral extraction and processing including recycling, as well as closure and post closure activities.
Actions should push the EU to the forefront of a safer, more sustainable and intelligent extraction of mineral resources through the deployment of technologies such as electrification of ground and underground mobility, remote controlling, automation or autonomous processes with a particular focus on historic mine sites and deep deposits. Actions should develop sustainable solutions through industrial and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant mining and processing value chains and technologies.
Proposals should target minerals and metals and can address individual elements of the raw materials value chain or the value chain as a whole, and should provide quantitative measures of the progress beyond the state of the art. Proposals are also required to seek end user involvement to drive the research with their requirements and test the developed solutions, with a clear path to the exploitation of the results.
Actions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain and should consider standardisation aspects when relevant.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. For TRLs 6-7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale manufacturing in the EU is expected, indicating the commitments of the industrial partners after the end of the project.

The positive environmental impact of lightweight composite materials most often occur due to benefits during the use-phase. The overall life-cycle benefits are often reduced as a consequence of negative environmental impacts associated with the manufacturing (energy consumption) and inherent challenges to regain the high-value components (fibre and matrix) at industrial scale. Development of new chemistries for fast curing resins, new bio-based composites (including fibres and core materials), joining technologies between composites and other materials and associated novel production techniques are expected to result in
Reduced cost for production of renewable lightweight materials, 25 % lower cost than currently used materials;
Light-weight products containing >50% sustainable, bio-based materials;
Up to 30% lightweight potential through tailored functionality for a range of extreme environment (energy, infrastructures, aeronautics, space) applications and in surface transport;

A step change is needed to develop new sustainable and high performance lightweight materials and associated novel manufacturing techniques which comply with industrial demands for quality and reliability. Research areas to be addressed include:
Development of new chemistries for fast curing resins (including bioresins) and associated novel production techniques (e.g. out-of-autoclave processes to reduce energy consumption);
Utilisation of existing or development of cost competitive renewable resins and/or core materials in combination with new fibres to make all renewable lightweight composites and structures;
Technologies and material design paradigms that enable hybrid composites based on a variety of constituents e.g. combinations of virgin and recycled fibres, bio-fibres including appropriate fibre coatings, etc. towards maximum cost and environmental benefits with a life-cycle perspective;
High performance high temperature polymer composites with potential to extended use at temperatures above 300C. Besides general material and manufacturing, the long-term durability of materials in service is a potential are of research and development;

","30 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Optimised lightweight designs often require the use of multi-materials, often with different physical properties, such as polymers composites and metals. The manufacturing of multimaterial structures is thus a challenging task and many industries are today addressing specific critical challenges that come with mixing of materials. It is of great importance that multimaterial design is analysed from a holistic and multidisciplinary perspective where all aspects from design to manufacturing, use and recycling are included in the process. This will help industry make the change from traditional design based on one material to multi-material design of lightweight structures.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Contribute to energy efficiency, increase competitiveness of new multi-materials items and multi-functional materials and products for a wide range of applications in the additive manufacturing industries and in specific industrial sectors e.g. transport including aeronautic, and maritime, consumer customised goods, communications, biomaterials, health and energy;
Develop optimised structures in terms of operational performance and weight with a goal of reducing weight by 50% compared to traditional designs;
Reduced lead-time of multimaterial products of 20% compared to today's design of multimaterial products that creates an increased competitiveness for the EU's industry;
Strengthening of the EU's manufacturing industry through the intensive implementation of innovative and unconventional technologies along the EU's manufacturing value chain;
Combine materials with high uniformity and with high mobility in industrial quantities with high reproducible quality;

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Measurable improvements in resource efficiency and decarbonisation of buildings and their construction/renovation, as a result of using digital building logbooks;
Improved linkages of existing databases, tools and sources for digital building logbooks;
Improved usability of digital building logbooks through user eXperience, taking into account issues of accessibility as well as inclusivity;
New or improved tools for collection and update of relevant data;
Demonstrate other benefits of using digital building logbooks e.g. safety and health in buildings and construction for instance by structural health monitoring; cost effectiveness, efficiency gains in terms of time; enhanced climate resilience.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
There is a need to demonstrate and realise the potential benefits of using digital depositories of information that accompany buildings throughout their lifecycle. These digital building logbooks (DBL) can potentially result in greater efficiency, circularity and transparency in the building stock. DBLs should also improve decision making for all actors along the lifecycle of the building, thereby facilitating better design choices and greater sustainability, contributing in this way to the New European Bauhaus initiative.
Proposals should:
Research and propose innovative approaches that utilise DBL features and functionalities, User eXperience, interoperability, data governance and the connection with other initiatives;
Demonstrate the benefits of DBL in terms of e.g. productivity, collaboration across the construction ecosystem, resource efficiency, decarbonisation, safety and health, climate resilience;
Consider both current and future opportunities to collect data from new technologies (e.g. sensors, real-time energy use, drones, 3D scanning) or existing and upcoming platforms (e.g. Sustainable product passports for construction materials) enabling additional data platforms. The DBL could link as well to those new data platforms, which will come with new possibilities and responsibilities in terms of data privacy and security;
Research and develop common ‘languages’ – interfaces and protocols – to enable interoperability, data consistency (as for example through common European data spaces for the manufacturing sector to ensure enhanced access to privately held data, via industrial data platforms) and information exchange; introduce a Common Information Model for next generation DBL capitalizing on existing standards and proposing extensions for missing features;
Address the problem of “data matching” and data verification. There is also a high potential for advanced technologies, such as blockchain, to support the alleviation of these issues and the application of such technologies should be explored;
Consider developing or making use of data quality marking schemes.
The DBL “features” (e.g. digital interface, data syncing, etc.) and ""functionalities” (services built around the DBL) should prioritise user-friendliness and a smart interface for end-users. Proposals are expected to demonstrate a “modular and layered” structure for the DBL, developing additional functionalities as extensions to the national schemes, ensuring that it is flexible enough to make the right information available to the right actor at the right time.
Proposals should take into account User eXperience (UX) principles in order to stimulate the update of the building logbook and its use by construction professionals and building owners.
Proposals should ensure that the functionalities offered by DBL and the corresponding benefits are easily understood by construction and building professionals as well as building owners.

","30 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Electrification of the industrial production process by shifting from the chemical conversion process to an electrochemical conversion process;
Efficient integration of renewable electricity to drive the conversion process;
Significant reduction of CO2 emissions of the overall industrial process, including the emissions related to the generation of the electricity;
Energy savings compared to the classical production routes;
Overall material savings (waste reduction) compared to the classical production routes;
Competitive costs of the new process technology and its integration in the processing line, including upstream and downstream.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
Renewable electricity will play a major role in the transition towards a low carbon energy supply. The production of chemicals, bulk materials and metals through the direct use of renewable electricity and energy sources can be realised by electrochemical conversion in photo- and/or electro-catalytic processes. Besides the reduction of CO2 emissions, other advantages of electrochemical conversion with renewable electricity can be the higher selectivity, process flexibility, or the possibility of accessing chemical pathways unattainable in a conventional reactor. Furthermore, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) directly uses the solar radiation to drive the electrochemical reaction, enabling potential higher efficiencies and lower costs.
At present, there are promising electrochemical routes towards a wide range of products in process industries. These include processes such as hydrogenation of biomass into valuable chemicals, recovery of metals from waste streams (including strategic or scarce materials), electrosynthesis of ammonia and organic molecules, production of lime by electrochemical splitting, electrolytic production of metals, (in-situ) production of hydrogen peroxide or ozone, etc.
Advanced electrochemical systems, configurations and novel technologies can enable higher efficiencies and/or lower investments or operational costs. High temperature electrochemical processes, using ionic liquids or molten salts as electrolytes, offer interesting alternatives to the classical production processes as well opportunities for the development of sustainable technology. Paired synthesis, where two valuable products are generated through the cathodic and anodic reactions, can help to reduce energy consumption and costs (per unit product). The integration of PEC technologies removes the intermediate electricity production step, which can make the conversion process more energy efficient. Processes that involve multistep transformations can be improved with a cell design that allows for the selective realisation of complex reactions in a single unit and low-cost downstream processing.
All these novel electrochemical paths need to integrate process design and optimisation with the development of advanced materials and reactor/cell components as well as low-energy separation processes.
Proposals should address the following aspects:
Development of the new electrochemical conversion route towards a product or intermediate of interest for process industries and demonstration at an appropriate scale;
Optimisation of the reactor design and operation and the electrochemical parameters (mass and charge transfer) towards an improved electrochemical performance (increased Faradaic efficiency, lower overpotential, etc.);
Optimisation of the reactor design and operation and the electrochemical parameters towards the increased lifetime or reduced cost of the electrochemical reactor components (electrode, electrolyte, catalyst, membrane);
Development of suitable electrodes and electrocatalyst for the new conversion route towards a high selectivity and performance;
Efficient integration of renewable energy sources, considering also their intermittency and the possibility to offer demand-response flexibility;
Integrated process design, including materials, reactor/cell and separation methods, from the process intensification and cost perspectives;
Demonstration and validation of the proposed concepts at an appropriate scale under environmental relevant conditions. Industrial feasibility should be proven by techno-economic assessments.
The integration of oxidation and reduction reactions to produce valuable products in one system is a valuable aspect. The use of critical raw materials or toxic materials should be preferably avoided. The circular utilisation of a waste or emission stream as raw material and the use of inert or low carbon impact materials, in general, are positive aspects.
The proposed technology must not target the electrochemical conversion of CO2 or the production of hydrogen by water splitting, as these subjects are covered in other topics of the Work Programme.

Integrate fuel cells of alternative coal-based products for non-fossil coke, as well as increased use of non-fossil energy and reactants (e.g. green electricity for heat generation, biomass, green hydrogen) in downstream processes.

Steel plant gases are partly used internally as heating gases and partly used externally, in nearby power plants, to produce electricity at high cost and high CO2 load.
These gases could be used in reduction processes (blast furnace or even direct reduction) to reduce fossil carbon use, provided they are well prepared for injection in these processes. This notably includes cleaning, compression, heating and removal of oxidised compounds such as CO2 and H2O, e.g. through scrubbing or reforming operations.

Improved energy efficiency of the industrial process
Significant reduction of hydrogen fuel needs of the developed process with regards to the current fossil fuel needs
Competitive costs of the developed technologies
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
Hydrogen does not emit any carbon dioxide when used and, when produced with renewable energies, it offers a solution to decarbonise industrial processes, being an important enabler to meet the 2050 climate neutrality goal of the European Green Deal and EU’s clean energy transition. Hydrogen can be used as feedstock and energy carrier in energy-intensive industry sectors. Hydrogen presents an opportunity for EU industry to reduce emissions across a number of sectors. The integration of hydrogen into new production routes, the direct use of hydrogen for heating and the use and production of GHG emission-free hydrogen instead of carbon-intensive hydrogen will be fundamental to decarbonise EU industry across a number of sectors.
In energy-intensive sectors, hydrogen can replace fossil fuels to generate high temperature heat when combusted in furnaces, kilns, heaters or boilers. If GHG emission-free hydrogen is used instead of fossil fuels, a zero GHG emission heating process could be achieved. As hydrogen burns differently than the currently used fossil fuels, its use involves important changes to the furnaces/kilns or the heating process, such as need of new burners, adjustments in the combustion system, conductive zone of the furnace or the (off-)gas system, need of hydrogen compatible materials. The design of the new burners must include aspects that minimise the NOx formation, associated to conventional hydrogen burners, such as lower flame temperature, slower combustion, etc.
The future large demand of green hydrogen will lead to large-scale oxygen production in the water electrolysis. Although oxygen can be harmlessly vented, the by-product oxygen can be captured and effectively used in industrial processes. Using oxygen instead of air in combustion reactions can reduce the energy use of the combustion, increase heating system efficiency and reduce the energy loss in the exhaust gases.
The proposals should address the following aspects:
Redesign of the heating process for the use of hydrogen as the sole heating fuel, including redimensioning and adjustments of the combustion system, conductive zone of the furnace or the (off-)gas system, plus possible measures to minimise NOx emissions;
Modification of the heating equipment and infrastructure required for the use of hydrogen, e.g., new burners and hydrogen compatible equipment materials;
Development of an oxygen or oxygen-enriched air combustion process that replaces an air combustion process, considering the energy and cost efficiency of the process;
Integration of measurement and control instrumentation for detection and regulation of fuel gas characteristics and flows;
Proven economic viability, which will be impacted by several parameters, in comparison with other heating alternatives.

Proposals submitted under this topic should include a safety assessment, in line with the Safety Planning for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Projects of the European Hydrogen Safety Panel, and a life cycle assessment for the implementation of the developed technologies.

Projects are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
Provide regional, national and European public authorities and network operators, with customisable open source models of the components of the energy system, as well as tools to assemble these component models into a model of the energy system integrating the infrastructure related to all energy carriers in a given geographical area, with static and dynamic modelling capabilities.
Provide regional, national and European public authorities and network operators, with an open source tool to allow them to better plan and optimise the development of renewable and low emission energy sources and the enhancement of infrastructure (including storage) to meet the future energy needs in a geographical area, while minimising the total investment and operation cost, hence satisfying the future final uses of energy (sometimes used as a feedstock) by consumers, at lowest cost and with better quality of service.
Scope:
Advanced modelling tools to perform regional / cross-border and cross-energy vector system planning and optimisation on a long time horizon, where cross-sectoral disruptive innovations in industry, mobility and building sector can be included
Building on existing open source models or on the opening of currently proprietary models, as far as they are available, the project should develop and validate open source models of the components of the energy system and provide tools to integrate these component models into a system model to satisfy the (future) needs in a geographical area, thereby providing a planning tool for cost and emissions optimisation of the enhanced energy system at pan-European level. The aim is to better plan and optimise the expansion of the energy generation and transmission and storage systems to meet the (future) energy needs aggregated at a granularity level finer or equal to the NUTS2 level; the distribution layer to individual energy users is not to be considered.
The open source modelling tool should be composed of the most relevant of the following modules:
The multi-physics component models is expected to model the cost (CAPEX, fixed and variable OPEX, economic lifetime) and technical performances (including GHG emissions) of the components, they should be parametrised to take into account the local climate and socio-economic characteristics of the geographical area where they will be located, as well as the time-dimension, such as the season and time of day. The component models should be capable of dynamic modelling with appropriate time steps (e.g. quarterly or hourly power profile of sources for intraday balance assessment; weekly or monthly profile for seasonal balance). The component models need to be described with standard modelling languages and be modular, so that each one can be updated without impact on the others and can be assembled with other models. They should cover most of the components in the following list, at the very least one component in each of the 9 categories below:
Renewable energy sources: energy production units of several typical sizes, covering technologies, such as for example photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, solar thermal, geothermal, onshore wind, offshore wind, hydroelectric, tidal, wave, biogas, biomass … Modelling of their cost, GHG emissions, typical (average) production performance of the sources, taking into account (where applicable): the season (month of the year), time (hour of the day), geo-location (at NUTS-2 level), and other parameters that can affect cost/performance. Where applicable, the statistic variability of their performance should be given and power profiles should be generated, for running dynamic simulations when the component modules will be integrated into system modules. A large-scale source should have its own model, small-scale sources (such for example wind turbines or household PV) should be aggregated (e.g. households PV aggregated at the level of a city).
Non-renewable primary energy sources (natural gas, coal, oil, uranium …): extraction, import; modelling of the cost, capacity, GHG emissions and geolocation.
Non-renewable energy conversion: refineries producing fuels or hydrogen; modelling the cost and performance (including GHG emissions) of the conversion from the primary energy carrier to secondary energy carriers, including CCS where applicable.
Non-renewable electricity production (coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear …): cost and performance of existing or new power plants, including CCS where applicable; modelling the transformation from the primary energy carrier to electricity (including GHG emissions).
Renewable energy conversion: production of hydrogen and other renewable or low-emissions gaseous or liquid fuels; modelling of their cost and performances (power, efficiency …); modelling the conversion from the primary energy carrier to secondary energy carrier and by-products (O2, CO2, including GHG emissions …).
Energy storage models: stationary batteries (large scale and house), electric vehicle batteries, hydropower storage, thermal storage, methane storage, hydrogen storage … ; modelling of their cost and performances: power, efficiency, capacity, life expectancy, state-of-charge (for dynamic modelling), life cycle GHG emissions.
Transport pipelines (including recompression stations): cost (per km) and performance (capacity, efficiency, GHG emissions) of existing and new natural gas, hydrogen, CO2 pipelines, district heating/cooling pipelines or of upgrading pipelines to admixtures of renewable gasses or to pure hydrogen or to CO2; as well as other infrastructure (e.g. LNG terminals) or logistics (e.g. transport by ship).
Transmission power lines: cost (per km) and performance (capacity, efficiency), of existing or new power lines, or for upgrading existing power lines to higher voltage/capacity.
Energy consumers: modelling of the energy use profile of typical consumers (industry, buildings, households, local heat networks, mobility and transport) for the different types of energy carriers, taking into account (where applicable): the season (month of the year, and associated average temperature), time (hour of the day), geo-location (at NUTS-2 level), and other parameters that can affect their energy use. Where applicable, the statistic variability of their performance should be given and power profiles should be generated, for running dynamic simulations when the component modules will be integrated into system modules. Where applicable, their capability to shift their consumption in time (demand response) and to store energy should be modelled, including the cost of this flexibility service. A large-scale user should have its own model; small-scale users, such for example household or eVehicle and (bi-directional) charging or refuelling stations, should be aggregated at the level of a city or NUTS2 region.
New methods to take into accounts new types of assets connected to the grids (Electric Vehicles (EV), microgrids, storage, small scale production, non-synchronous generators, etc.) and considering the cost-effective coupling with other energy networks.
System modelling, planning and optimisation tool:
A system modelling tool should be developed to integrate the models of the components located in a geographical area into a system model. The models will use available data on the future needs of industry and other end-user sectors. The system modelling tool should allow both static and dynamic simulations, to assess the intraday, weekly and seasonal balances and associated grids stability. The modelling tool has to be modular and open to ensure coupling with other models, for example models including the exchange of resources and materials (enabling industrial-urban symbiosis and circularity), as well as socio-economic and market models.
Based on the system model, an optimisation and medium-long term grid planning tool should be developed to optimise the development pathways for renewable energy and other low emissions sources, storage and the enhancement of infrastructure, to meet the future energy needs in a geographical area, while minimising the total investment and operation cost, hence satisfying the future final uses of energy vectors of consumers, at lowest cost and climate impact.
Visualisation tools should be developed to support the system modelling, the optimisation process and their results, notably in the format of dynamic energy heat maps. The compatibility of the results format with the JRC visualisation tools should be ensured.
Validation of the models and tools:
Methodologies and procedures should be developed for the certification of the components models and, if possible, system models.
The component models, system modelling and optimisation tools need to be validated by using them in support of the planning of the energy transition of two real-life geographical areas: one macro-region (e.g. several small or large countries) and one large (possibly cross-border) industrial cluster. The validations should cover the range of models and tools developed, and should therefore include in particular the dynamic modelling of relevant energy sources (intermittent and dispatchable), different existing or new energy networks, conversion between different energy vectors, energy storage and energy consumers capable of demand response.
The component models and the system modelling/optimisation tools need to be a properly documented and open source development allowing the EC, the Member States and Associated Countries and other public authorities or private organisations to use the tools for their planning needs, or to develop additional add on modules. The models and tools, as well as the relevant documentation and user guides, should be published under an appropriate open license and made available to the modelling community on the Energy Modelling Platform for Europe[1]. The results of the project have to be disseminated, notably at the EMP-E annual conference. Upon completion of the projects presently supporting the EMP-E platform and conference, the selected project should take over supporting the platform and organising the annual conference.
The research should entail interviews with relevant grid operators and public administrations in all EU Member States/ Associated Countries, so as to collect their views on how the tools could best meet their needs. At least 2 interviews per MS/AC should be foreseen.
The development of the models, simulation, optimisation and visualisation tools will be closely coordinated with Commission services (including the Joint Research Centre).
The selected projects are expected to contribute to relevant BRIDGE[2] activities.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Develop and demonstrate novel modular, compact, high performances, thermal energy storage solutions (TES) for heating, hot tap water and cooling for electricity load shifting. The integration of the solution within the energy networks of the building and its system management should allow different functions, such as peak load reduction, energy saving, energy cost minimization.
Develop and demonstrate a novel thermal energy storage system much more compact than state-of-the-art technologies, enabling the storage of heat and cold for domestic applications for periods typically of 4 weeks long.
Scope:
The scope covers the whole spectrum of application of the thermal energy storage systems, ranging from short run to longer run, as well as from the smaller to bigger sizes:
Thermal end-uses (space heating, hot tap water, cooling) represent a major share of the European electricity demand with consumption often at peak times. Integration into the building heating system and in the smart electricity grid is a key development aspect, next to the storage materials and technologies. Such storage devices reduces the demand for electricity from the grid at peak times during the day, allowing off peak electricity to be used in the building for satisfying cooling needs during summer and/or heating demand, for space heating and hot tap water at later times. The typical charging power is in the order of 3 kW, for periods of up to three hours. The TES system is conceived modularly. The high volumetric energy density is a basic requirement given its utilization.
For buildings not connected to district heating and cooling network, a much more compact TES system is needed to optimize and to increase the integration of varying RES . Such systems need much less volume than state-of-the-art technologies, realized with materials that have extremely low heat losses and enable the storage of heat and cold for domestic applications for periods typically up to 4 weeks. Cost reduction is a very important target, as the present solutions are too expensive. The ideal thermochemical TES process should have high reaction heat; Good reversibility; Fast charging and discharging rates; Stable reaction products; Non-toxic, non-corrosive, non-flammable and non-explosive reactants and products; Large-scale availabilities and abundance, affordable price.
The nature of the activities concerns:
The development of novel phase change materials (PCM) and thermochemical materials (TCM) and components of required characteristics for thermochemical and PCM TES, characterized by low starting TRL (4). The development & adaptation of available heat exchanger and novel reactor designs; design and development of controls and modelling for novel sensors for TCM and PCM, starting from a higher TRL (5).
Ice cold storage having higher TRL (6).
The achievable storage density (kWh/m3) depends on the technological approach (sensible heat, PCM and TCM) and decreases drastically moving from the component to the system level. Furthermore, with the exception of TCM, the charge of the store decreases with elapsed time. The expected system level storage density measured initially and after four weeks from the charge should be indicated.
The selected projects are expected to contribute to relevant BRIDGE[1] activities.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Demonstrated increased performance (>20%) and reliability of tidal energy devices.
Improved knowledge on how to operate tidal energy devices, their availability, maintainability and survivability.
Reduction of LCOE approaching SET Plan targets (actions should clearly justify the estimated LCOE at project start and end using a recognised calculation methodology).
Reinforced industrial supply chain in Europe.
Attraction of private investors to the sector and reduce the cost of their investment to projects with evidences and credible key performance indicators.
Scope:
There is a need for further technology investigation and demonstration for improved reliability and efficiency of tidal turbine rotor and blades, including control and condition monitoring systems. Failure in a blade can create long downtimes, for instance blade edges can erode rapidly, facilitating water ingress, accelerating fatigue and the risk of failure. There are different blade solutions under development in terms of shape and material. Improving the seaworthiness of rotor and blades will reduce the likelihood of failure, reduced annual energy production and increases in operating costs.
The proposal is expected to:
Demonstrate innovative rotor and blade solutions including condition monitoring systems for tidal energy devices in real sea conditions for long periods of time (12-24 months) providing invaluable learnings regarding performance, reliability, availability, maintainability, survivability and environmental impact.
Apply high performance computing and digitalisation (e.g. data processing, machine learning and data analytics methods for implementation in data driven design, digital twins and control and monitoring for O&M).

Project results are expected to contribute to most of the following expected outcomes:
Demonstration of innovative storage technologies which go beyond the state-of-the art of existing storage solutions in respect of sustainability, technical performance, lifetime, non-dependency on location geographical particularities and cost.
Increased availability, robustness and safety of sustainable and efficient choices for energy storage to reduce energy losses and improve the environmental footprint of the energy system.
Demonstrated availability and functionality of innovative energy storage systems developed for specific system designs and applications.
Improvement of the already established European storage value chain able to contribute to the EU climate neutrality objectives.
Creation and improvement of European technological value chains with the potential for international cooperation and market exploration
Demonstration of successful business cases and systems designs for energy storage integration solutions in innovative and 'green' energy systems at different scales and timeframes.
Demonstration of effective integration of innovative energy storage systems and value chains at the interface of renewable energies and specific demand sectors
Ensuring the compatibility of systems and standards of distributed energy storage for participation in flexibility markets.
Scope:
Demonstration of successful operation and integration of either standalone or combined innovative storage solutions (e.g. chemical, electrical, thermal, mechanical including e.g. compressed air/liquid, supercapacitors, innovative hydropower storage solutions) into innovative energy systems and grid architectures. Material development with respect to Supercapacitors is excluded from this topic, as it is treated in Cluster 4, topic HORIZON-CL4-2022-RESILIENCE-01-24 (""Novel materials for supercapacitor energy storage"").
Solutions should in particular explore, how innovative storage solutions can enable and drive further the successful penetration of renewable into the European energy mix across several important demand sectors (industry, energy, transport, residential, agriculture) by delivering effectively at the interface of renewable energies and specific demand sector needs.
The solutions should show clear innovation with respect to the state of the art e.g. through use of new advanced materials or new design solutions, always bearing in mind the objective of sustainability and circular economy, minimizing the environmental footprint.
The demonstrated technologies should respond to energy storage flexibility requirements in form of technological requirements and expected future investment and operational costs and business cases in existing or emerging energy markets, by acknowledging existing system designs and energy grid architectures. The demonstrated technologies should include interfaces for connecting with existing infrastructure, e.g. of hydraulic systems for innovative hydropower or the use of natural gas storage sites for hydrogen or biomethane storage, or abandoned infrastructure such as mines, or storage solutions in district heating networks.
When integrating the storage solution, common architecture models (Smart Grids Architecture Model - SGAM[1]) and implementing standards (such as CEN-CENELEC, SAREF etc.) should be taken into account to ensure interoperability and compatibility.
Highest interoperability should be reached ideally for all, but in any case for most of the use cases of storage, so that cost of deployment of distributed storage is decreased.
Technical and regulatory barriers, also including the market dimension, should be taken into account. This together with considering consumer acceptance of the solution as a prerequisite to increasing participation of consumers in the energy system.

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In the context of eliminating pollution to guarantee a clean and healthy environment and in line with the zero pollution ambition, successful proposals will deliver governance solutions that halt nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollution and limit N/P emissions to remain within safe ecological boundaries at European, regional and local scale while restoring water, air and soil ecosystems.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Dynamic interfaces between rural/coastal and urban/industrial environments that allow for the exploitation of hitherto untapped synergies in eliminating and preventing N/P pollution
Mainstreamed circular and sustainable use of N and P recovered from urban/industrial contexts and returned to agricultural/primary production in rural/coastal environments throughout Europe, with a view to closing N/P cycles and stimulating a market for recovered N and P
Best practice on how to implement innovative governance models shared among relevant stakeholders across the EU
Better informed and less fragmented policies and regulatory instruments at regional, national and European scale to promote re-balancing N/P flows and restoring ecosystem services to stay within safe ecological and planetary boundaries
Scope:
In line with the overarching objective to bring N/P flows back within safe ecological and planetary boundaries and to achieve the deliverables of the European Green Deal and other relevant EU legislation, at regional level, this Innovation Action (Pilot) explores innovative governance solutions to support transferring resources and services between rural/coastal and urban/industrial environments while limiting N/P emissions and other emissions exacerbating pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change. N/P relevant materials and residues discarded in one environment may be a valuable resource in another context but are not always exploited due to systemic or structural barriers. Actions may include piloting incentives (regulatory, structural, financial, behavioural etc.), innovative supply and value chains and novel infrastructures or other governance solutions.
Proposals should
Develop novel or adapt existing governance models and test in an operational environment how these innovative tools and instruments will drive systemic change to promote circularity, environmental protection and closed N/P circles at the urban/rural interface.
Demonstrate these innovative governance models in geographically representative regional clusters throughout the EU and associated countries. A cluster may be formed by two or more regions/river basins, in EU and associated countries, with very similar characteristics in terms of territorial conditions or being neighbouring regions/river basins, which feature similar degrees of N/P emission pressures as well as physical, social and economic specificities and governance structures. All relevant stakeholders (local authorities, farmers and other rural stakeholders, urban/industrial actors, environmental protection organisations, academia etc.) should be involved.
Showcase how innovative governance models at relevant levels can contribute to achieving EU objectives, such as the targets of the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies on reducing fertiliser use by 20% and nutrient losses by 50% until 2050[1], by fostering ecologically responsible and sustainable use, recovery and exchange of N/P relevant resources, services and infrastructures between urban/industrial and rural/coastal environments while taking into account local specificities.
Identify opportunities to exchange N/P flows between both environments and demonstrate novel governance/structural approaches to fully exploit synergies that help bring these flows back within safe ecological boundaries by building on past and ongoing Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects that develop a regional N/P load target approach while keeping within safe ecological boundaries.
Implement innovative practices and technologies at different governance and stakeholder levels in order to promote increased dialogue and collaboration, to encourage behavioural change and public acceptance of recovered products as well as more effective problem-solving mechanisms.
Assess these novel governance approaches, develop guidelines and recommendations for all concerned stakeholders on how to best implement these novel governance approaches, disseminate results and best practice, and envisage regional twinning and mentoring schemes.
Review existing EU policies and contribute to designing harmonised, coherent and efficient policies and regulatory instruments that facilitate eliminating and preventing N/P pollution and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological and economic cost of non-action.
Applicants are encouraged to select different regional clusters per project and to diversify their proposed consortium by involving a wide range of relevant stakeholders, such as primary producers, representatives of administrations at different levels, actors from related industries, value chains, environment organisations, academia, citizens, etc. Proposals should further include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded within this topic.
This topic is part of the demonstration projects for the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and should be carried out in close cooperation with it.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING
WHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering certifies that an organisation is able to carry out high quality solidarity activities in compliance with the principles, objectives and requirements of the action ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’. Obtaining this Quality Label is a precondition for participation only in volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?
When applying for a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, applicant organisations can choose one of the following roles:
Support role - entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, mediation between them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity. The support role also entitles the organisation to submit project applications and coordinate partnerships for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects;
Host role - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the participant during all the phases as appropriate
HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is awarded following a selection process, involving three main stages: submission of application, assessment and award.
The applications for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any time) during the programming period, to the Executive Agency, which is the sole implementing body for this action. The applications will be evaluated at set intervals, according to an annual timetable, which is aligned to the timetable of the Humanitarian Aid Volunteering call for projects.
Applications will be assessed against eligibility, selection, exclusion and award criteria (for more information on the selection and exclusion criteria, see Part E of this Guide). Successful organisations will be awarded the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering. The Executive Agency will award this Quality Label and monitor compliance and may carry out periodical reassessments. The Quality Label will be valid for the entire duration of the programming period and until the end of the last project in which the organisation is involved.
In order to facilitate partner-finding and the setting up of project consortia, profiles of all organisations holding this Quality Label are published in a database of Quality Label organisations on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. To identify potential partners, partner searching tool on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal can be used.
Once awarded a Quality Label, organisations gain access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to advertise activities. Organisations have to make use of the European Solidarity Corps Portal's database to search for potential partners and participants. Information in the database is published as it is formulated in the Quality Label application form.
APPLYING FOR A QUALITY LABEL ON BEHALF OF HOSTING ORGANISATION - THE SIMPLIFIED HOST PROCEDURE
An organisation established in a programme country that applies for support role may also apply for host role on behalf of its branches located in non programme countries with which it shares the same legal personality (simplified hosting procedure). This procedure is designed to help larger organisations, with several branches located in different countries.
The applicant supporting organisation is accountable for the quality and safety of activities offered by simplified hosting organisation(s) on behalf of which it is applying.
WHAT ARE THE QUALITY STANDARDS?
The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process. Participating organisations must respect the following principles and standards:
Equal opportunities and non-discrimination. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective way, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project context. In order to promote inclusion, participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer, with the exception of possible contributions to travel costs (if the grant does not fully cover these costs). The activities should respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Avoidance of job substitution. Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should complement the work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of service.
Avoidance of harmful activities. Security and safety of the participants, participating organisations and target groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as environmental crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child (https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/eu_guidelines_rights_of_child_0.pdf)
Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities. The volunteering tasks should enable participants to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Particular attention will be given to the capacity of hosting organisations in third countries and the need to embed the activities of volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers’ interaction with local humanitarian actors, the hosting community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be recognised for volunteers, through validation of learning outcomes.
Adequate training, working and volunteering arrangements. Safe and decent living and working conditions must be ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that will outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.
“no profit”. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the activities funded by the grants awarded. Furthermore, volunteering should cover the participants’ expenditure arising from participation in such solidarity activities but should not provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.

QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING
WHAT IS THE QUALITY LABEL?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering certifies that an organisation is able to carry out high quality solidarity activities in compliance with the principles, objectives and requirements of the action ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’. Obtaining this Quality Label is a precondition for participation only in volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?
When applying for a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, applicant organisations can choose one of the following roles:
Support role - entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, mediation between them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity. The support role also entitles the organisation to submit project applications and coordinate partnerships for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects;
Host role - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the participant during all the phases as appropriate.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is awarded following a selection process, involving three main stages: submission of application, assessment and award.
The applications for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any time) during the programming period, to the Executive Agency, which is the sole implementing body for this action. The applications will be evaluated at set intervals, according to an annual timetable, which is aligned to the timetable of the Humanitarian Aid Volunteering call for projects.
Applications will be assessed against eligibility, selection, exclusion and award criteria (for more information on the selection and exclusion criteria, see Part E of this Guide). Successful organisations will be awarded the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering. The Executive Agency will award this Quality Label and monitor compliance and may carry out periodical reassessments. The Quality Label will be valid for the entire duration of the programming period and until the end of the last project in which the organisation is involved.
In order to facilitate partner-finding and the setting up of project consortia, profiles of all organisations holding this Quality Label are published in a database of Quality Label organisations on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. To identify potential partners, partner searching tool on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal can be used.
Once awarded a Quality Label, organisations gain access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to advertise activities. Organisations have to make use of the European Solidarity Corps Portal's database to search for potential partners and participants. Information in the database is published as it is formulated in the Quality Label application form.
APPLYING FOR A QUALITY LABEL ON BEHALF OF HOSTING ORGANISATIONS –THE SIMPLIFIED HOST PROCEDURE
An organisation established in a programme country that applies for support role may also apply for host role on behalf of its branches located in non programme countries with which it shares the same legal personality (simplified hosting procedure).This procedure is designed to help larger organisations, with several branches located in different countries.
The applicant supporting organisation is accountable for the quality and safety of the activities offered by the simplified hosting organisation(s) on behalf of which it is applying.
TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANISATIONS HOLDING AN EUAID VOLUNTEERS CERTIFICATION
The organisations which have been awarded an EU Aid Volunteers certification under the EU Aid Volunteers initiative (programme period 2014-2020) and that wish to continue to participate in the new European Solidarity Corps programme will have the possibility to apply for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering by following a lighter procedure compared to organisations without the EU Aid Volunteers certification. In order to qualify for this procedure, these organisations will be required to hold a valid EUAV certification at application stage.
EU Aid Volunteers certified sending and hosting organisations are considered to already fulfil essential requirements for the award of the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering notable in relation to safety and security measures, documentation of humanitarian aid experience, travel, working and living conditions of volunteers, equal treatment policies etc.
WHAT ARE THE QUALITY STANDARDS ?
The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process. Participating organisations must respect the following principles and standards:
Equal opportunities and non-discrimination. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective way, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project context. In order to promote inclusion, participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer, with the exception of possible contributions to travel costs (if the grant does not fully cover these costs). The activities should respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Avoidance of job substitution. Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should complement the work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of service.
Avoidance of harmful activities. Security and safety of the participants, participating organisations and target groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as environmental crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child.
Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities. The volunteering tasks should enable participants to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Particular attention will be given to the capacity of hosting organisations in third countries and the need to embed the activities of volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers’ interaction with local humanitarian actors, the hosting community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be recognised for volunteers, through validation of learning outcomes.
Adequate training, working and volunteering arrangements. Safe and decent living and working conditions must be ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that will outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.
“no profit”. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the activities funded by the grants awarded. Furthermore, volunteering should cover the participants’ expenditure arising from participation in such solidarity activities but should not provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.

","30 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Demonstrate an increase in the waste reduction by application of digital technologies
Demonstrate optimisation of use of secondary raw materials in the value chains.
Scope:
Circularity is an essential part of a wider transformation of industry towards climate neutrality and long-term competitiveness. It can deliver substantial material savings throughout value chains and production processes, generate extra value and unlock economic opportunities. While circularity is in simple terms addressed by waste from one process becoming secondary materials for others, an efficient use in the value chain in order to close the loop or reuse in other industries, can be ensured only through a transparent information system. There is thus a need for designing and piloting an information system for raw materials and components in products throughout the whole value chain of process industries.
Proposals should:
Propose new solutions for improved use of secondary raw materials along the value chain of the own industry or in other industries;
Propose methodologies for digital tracing and certification of secondary raw materials. This should include real-time access to information on material compositions and material quality along the whole value chain;
Propose digital tools for integration of product passport and/or certification schemes;
Propose open source software, open hardware design, and easy access to data, in order to facilitate access to information for the own and for other industries;
Develop means and tools to indicate the composition and origin of recycled materials (bar code could be an option) indicating the composition and origin.
Consider the co-design of learning resources together with local and regional educational organisations for current and future generations of employees, with the possibility of integrating them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes. Learning resources should integrate the identification of new skills and should propose innovative learning-teaching methods that meet regional social needs and have a high potential for replication.

","30 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects cost-effective outcomes will enable achieving the expected impacts of the destination by increasing access to primary raw materials, in particular critical raw materials for EU industrial value chains and strategic sectors.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Develop technologies and systems to continuously monitor environmental impacts and mitigation methods of deep sea exploration and future mining;
Develop multi-scale systems to identify gaps on the relevant available environmental data needed to develop statistically robust baselines that take into account the three-dimensional and temporal natural variability of the marine environment;
Provide technological and systemic solutions for forecasting potential environmental impacts of using the developed monitoring and mitigation methods.
Scope:
The global economic interest in deep-sea mineral resources has been growing and so are the concerns with the negative impacts on the deep sea ecosystems if mining activities start. The expected increase of the global demand for metals needed for the energy transition might become a driver to initiate commercial deep sea mining, paved by the technological advancements. However, before any deep-sea mining activities start, the environmental impacts, and how to mitigate them, need to be well understood; a robust legal framework needs to be in place and a reliable and transparent monitoring and supervising system for the activities taking place in the deep-sea has to be ready. For the sake of transparency and to properly assess the environmental consequences of the activities taking place in the deep sea over time, it is crucial to develop and to put in place a system capable of continuous monitoring, of the exploration and exploration activities, so the permitting and supervising authorities can access it remotely and at any moment.
The actions should design and develop a reliable and robust monitoring and inspection system for the exploration and future exploitation activities in the deep-sea. Before the monitoring and inspection systems are used a forecasting of the impact on the environment of these activities should be performed. Therefore, projects should deliver appropriate technological and systemic solutions for such forecasting assessments.
A monitoring and inspection system for the activities taking place in the deep sea is very complex because the activities take place in remote areas, in the middle of the ocean, and in an extreme environment, deep water column and consequent pressure and fragile ecosystems. The system needs to be fully transparent and capable of monitoring all relevant environmental parameters and at the same time protect business confidentiality. Due to the complexity of such system, the project has to be developed by a multidisciplinary team, looking at environmental, legal and technological solutions. Any bathymetry, geology, seabed habitats, chemistry, biology and physics marine data collected, in particular at the testing phase, should be INSPIRE[1] compliant and made available through the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet).
For each of the three mineral deposits (polymetallic nodules, manganese crusts and sulphide deposits) found at different depth ranges of the ocean the project will
Identify all the bio-chemical-physical parameters to be monitored at the bottom of the sea, along the water column and at the surface;
Identify all technical requirements needed for a real time monitoring of all parameters at the bottom, along the water column and surface, including the use of satellite data (Global Navigation Satellite System and Copernicus’ satellite constellation) and to make it continuously available for remote access;
Identify existing technological solutions and develop new ones to fulfil the technical requirements;
Design and develop the architecture of the system in view of incorporating the monitoring parameters, the technical requirements and the legal constrains;
Develop a trial version of the system and test it.
The project should build on and explore synergies with previous and ongoing EU funded projects on environmental impacts and environmentally friendly technologies for exploration and exploitation of the deep sea. The project should cooperate closely with the International Seabed Authority, notably with its Legal and Technical Commission, and take into account the legal framework for the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The project should take into account the developments of the international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Photovoltaic power generation is pivotal in the transition to a clean energy system and the achievement of the zero-emissions target. To that end, it is important to enhance affordability, security of supply and sustainability of PV technologies along with further efficiency improvements. To insure security of supply, retaining the whole value chain in Europe is essential; technology de-risking is a necessary step towards this direction. Consequently, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Promote a considerable pipeline of new and advanced versions of existing technologies from lab to fab production, enabling robust continued performance increase, opening up new applications and facilitating further cost reduction.
Reinforce the European PV value chain, support local companies to develop and sell differentiated and high value PV products and create local jobs.
Demonstrate the feasibility and cost-competiveness of the novel PV technologies.
Contribute towards establishing a solid European innovation base.
Enable and facilitate large-scale deployment of PV and generation of renewable electricity.
Minimise the impact of PV on landscape and environment by increasing its energy yield/m2.
Scope:
Net-zero scenarios modelled by the JRC[1] show that Europe needs to install up to 600 GW PV generation capacity by 2030 and over 1 TW by 2050 to reach its climate and energy objectives. The European market will grow 10-15% per year and reach close to 80 GW by 2030. In this race, Europe has a unique opportunity to develop and deploy new generation PV modules. A considerable number of new and advanced/innovative technologies is in the pipeline but the concrete application on pilot manufacturing lines is lagging behind. The aim is therefore to advance those technologies that offer the potential for much higher efficiency and/or higher energy yield, the same lifetime and degradation rate and comparable cost to standard crystalline technologies, opening-up possibilities for largescale 4.0 factories to drive down costs, allowing large relocation of production to Europe.
The proposal should address all of the following:
Develop and demonstrate at pilot line level innovative or alternative and advanced versions of existing PV technologies: the pilot lines should show the feasibility and cost-competitiveness of industrial production of cells and modules.
Develop corresponding manufacturing equipment.
Implement Industry 4.0 concepts.
Test and validate the performance characteristics of manufactured products (efficiency, durability, reliability, etc.).
Demonstrate a business case for manufacturing plants of individual output capacity in the GW range and a market introduction strategy.
Address the following related aspects: lower environmental impact, better resource efficiency than current commercial renewable technologies, circularity potential (including recycling and sustainability by design).
Document all demonstrators fully and transparently to ensure replicability and up scaling, to assist future planning decisions.
The proposal should involve multidisciplinary consortia including industrial partners.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
As wind turbines grow bigger and taller, the blade tips are increasing more affected by turbulent atmospheric flow features, while airborne wind energy systems operate at even higher altitudes. This zone of the atmosphere currently lays between the current numeric models at the microscale and the mesoscale. Further, the data integration of the models of these different altitudes is still scarce. Thus, there is a need for an improved understanding of atmospheric flow physics, particularly regarding wind power production forecasting and the design of wind energy technology components.
It is expected that better predictions of wind patterns should:
Support improved wind farm design, location choice, distribution and operation thus bridging the gap between small-scale controlled experiments and full-scale deployment;
Enhance system reliability and power production;
Decrease economic uncertainties related to farm design and power production, as well as wind technology components design and durability;
Lead to the development of numerical models capable of accurately forecasting high wind flow and power production. It will also improve wakes modelling and the integration of models with real condition wind farm data;
Use open access of Big Data storage and usage for the testing and performance tracking of the numeric models.
Scope:
The proposal is expected to address all of the following aspects:
Develop an open access knowledge hub for experimental data, based on the principles of open data sharing.
Develop and validate numeric models to accurately forecast wind flow in low, medium and high altitudes in onshore and offshore scenarios. These models should address how external factors, such as wind conditions, and different climate affect power production and loads on target and neighbouring wind power systems;
Integrate these different developments (knowledge hub and forecasting models) into a tool able to be readily absorbed by the sector. This integrated approach need to be applicable to at least 2 of these different wind energy conversion technologies: onshore wind, offshore wind (fixed bottom or floating), and high altitude wind systems;
Validate and promote how such tools could be used to improve the design and deployment of wind farms, through case studies;
Address and test how such integrated tools can be used for design development of wind technology components (for example blades, towers, substructures, kites, etc.), in particular on the issue of energy efficiency and material durability.
Further indirect impacts on decreased material usage, system efficiency, and social issues should also be made explicit. In order to optimise impact and enhance synergies, cooperation with projects from the Horizon 2020 LC-SC3-RES-31-2020 call is particularly encouraged.

Photovoltaic power generation is pivotal in the transition to a clean energy system and the achievement of the zero-emissions target. To that end, it is important to enhance affordability, security of supply and sustainability of PV technologies along with further efficiency improvements. Consequently, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Increase the efficiency and stability and minimise the environmental impact of Perovskite PV.
Enlarge with bandgap tuneable perovskites and corresponding device architectures the integration and application possibilities of PV technology.
Increase the potential for commercialisation of perovskite PV, creating a competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base.
Scope:
Perovskite PV are welcomed as an emerging technology for solar energy conversion, as today they afford high power conversion efficiency (PCE), higher than 25%. At the same time, perovskite semiconductors are based on abundant and low-cost starting materials and can be processed using simple and economic methods. The tuneable bandgap of the perovskite materials opens a lot of applications in a wide range of optoelectronic devices, even beyond solar cells. To ensure however economic feasibility and competitive levelized cost of electricity, the technology should offer long-term stability alongside high power conversion efficiency to match the reliability of silicon-wafer-based modules (the lifetime expectation for a PV module in a power plant is 20–25 years). At present, the long-term stability of lead halide perovskite modules does not meet this target and improvements are hampered by a lack of understanding of the cell and module failure modes. In addition to the intrinsic cell stability issues of perovskite PV, the usage of lead and scaling-up are the main challenges towards bringing perovskite technologies to the market.
The proposal should address all of the following:
Research and resolve the degradation issues/mechanisms encountered from material to module and produce stable and highly efficient perovskite PV architectures/modules by optimizing the constituent materials, the architecture of the cell, the interfaces, the interconnections between cells, the environment conditions during the fabrication steps of cells and modules, the encapsulation of cells and modules, etc.
Propose new device concepts and new materials (improved lead-halide perovskites or Pb-free perovskite analogues) to deal with any toxicity issues.
Ensure compliance with the relevant protocols (ISOS) at laboratory scale.
Develop adequate stability assessment methods/measurements; propose and perform device/module real –life (under actual outdoor operating conditions) characterisation for reliability and energy yield assessment.
Identify environmental “hotspots” and how to address them. Perform a life cycle analysis (including decommissioning and disposal) to bring evidence of the low environmental impact, better resource efficiency than current commercial PV technologies, and circularity potential.

To achieve the goals of climate-neutrality by 2050, renewable energy sources installations will have an explosive growth. Wind energy, in particular, will play a large role on supplying clean energy to the electrical grid. Nevertheless, this growth must be done in a sustainable manner and following the principles set out in the Circular Economy Action Plan and the Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials. Thus, clear and decisive actions will need to be taken now to assure that the future wind farms are sustainable and circular, while also dealing with current wind farms and the recycling of their components, once they reach the end of their lifetime. The nature of this challenge involves different kinds of activities.
The first activity is on the development of large-scale industrial demonstration of composite material recycling technologies to increase the circularity of wind technology. This demonstration will focus on flexible approaches for composite recycling, and on the development of a knowledge hub involving other composite-heavy sectors, in order to share best practices and to identify common challenges.
Another activity is on the development of alternative solutions to replace/substitute critical raw materials. Further constraints linked to the availability of rare earths elements used in the wind sector, in particular for permanent magnets, are also relevant in this context.
The project results are expected to contribute to the promotion of the ‘circularity by design’ approach in the wind energy sector, and to support the adoption of life cycle assessment tools, demonstrating reduced carbon footprint on the wind turbine value chain.
Scope:
The proposal is expected to address one of the following activity areas:
On the development of large-scale industrial demonstration of composite material recycling technologies to increase the circularity of wind technology, proposals are expected to demonstrate recycling technologies at large-scale in an operating environment. The proposed solution will be a flexible production line, able to deal with a large amount of material (including, for example, coatings, paints, etc.) and applicable to several manufacturers and possibly to other sectors. The proposed solution should also have a long-term plan, with a business plan, beyond the life of the project. The proposals will also build a knowledge hub within the sector and with other sectors to transfer information and to promote recycling in the renewable energy sector and ‘circularity by design’ as a solution.
On the development of alternative solutions to replace/substitute critical raw materials, proposals need to develop and demonstrate, in a relevant or operational environment, solutions and their supply cycles, improving efficiency of sourcing processes and effectively replacing the constrained materials. The development of advanced ‘circular by design’ materials should also be considered. The solutions proposed should be in line with the Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials [1]and the Foresight Study on Critical Raw Materials for Strategic Technologies and Sectors in the EU[2]. Finally, the proposals will indicate the effect that such proposed solutions have on promoting circularity and/or recyclability on wind energy, as well as their circularity potential, their financial feasibility, and their potential to be upscaled. Further, the proposals should address and support life cycle analysis as a tool to bring into evidence the environmental impact and resource efficiency of proposed solutions.
Independently of the activity tackled, the proposal has to include a clear go/no go moment ahead of entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go moment, the project will have to deliver the detailed engineering plans and all needed permits for the deployment of the project. In the case of the first activity, the project will also have to deliver a complete business and implementation plan. The proposal is expected to clearly demonstrate a proposed pathway to obtaining necessary permits for the demonstration actions and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The proposal is expected to also demonstrate how it will get a financial close[3] for the whole action. Independent experts will assess all deliverables and will advise for the go/no-go decision.

Demonstrate that automated manufacturing of integrated photovoltaics (IPV) can deliver cost competitive products assuming both the function of energy generators and of structural elements.
Reinforce the European PV value chain, support local companies to develop and sell differentiated IPV products and create local jobs.
Enable and facilitate large-scale integration of PV in buildings in line with the concept of “positive energy buildings”, in infrastructure, transport, agriculture, etc.
Minimise the impact of PV on landscape and environment exploiting its modularity and synergies of use.
Scope:
“Integrated PV” stands for photovoltaics that are embedded into components fulfilling other functions. The most well-known and developed application currently is Building Integrated PV (BIPV), in which PV is integral part of construction elements (tiles, façades, cladding, …) and assembled to constitute a system replacing a conventional building envelope solution. However, other Integrated PV (IPV) solutions are markedly emerging, for example in infrastructure (IIPV), in the automotive industry (VIPV), in agriculture, etc. In addition to the overall PV goal of lowering the LCOE, IPV applications can bring the extra value of decentralized, point-of-use electricity generation and simultaneously fulfil another function such as of a roofing, facade or sound barrier. Progressively developing and having the potential for a world-wide market with huge opportunities for the European industry, manufacturing of customized IPV in series production concept needs to be developed to bring down the cost of Integrated PV allowing for largescale production and use.
The proposal should address all of the following:
Demonstrate at pilot line level flexible automated manufacturing for:
differentiated product design (format, different thicknesses of substrate and variations in the solar cell matrix, encapsulation material, front sheet, etc.) respecting freedom of design and aesthetics for various applications;
integration of advanced robust techniques for inline process and quality control;
equipment design easily adaptable to rapidly emerging novel cell and module technologies;
high product efficiency and durability at competitive costs, in conformity with codes and standards of integrated photovoltaics (IPV) use.
Implement Industry 4.0 concepts.
Demonstrate a business case and a market introduction strategy.
Facilitate the ‘renovation wave’ by establishing an active collaboration between the PV sector and the building industry for seamless industrial construction/renovation workflows.
Address the following related aspects: low environmental impact, resource efficiency and circularity potential.

","01 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal should support the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy and the farm to fork strategy to transition to a fair, healthy and resilient European agriculture, notably its objective to foster EU-grown plant proteins, in line with the ‘’Report on the development of plant proteins in the EU’’[1]. They should do so by increasing the availability of crops and breeds that cater for the specific needs of the legume sector, thus supporting increased (agro-) biodiversity and the transition to sustainable, productive, climate-neutral and resilient farming systems that minimise pressure on ecosystems while ensuring fair economic returns for farmers and food consumption that is sustainable in terms of both health and the environment.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Improved legume varieties for different attributes/traits (e.g., resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses, nutrient composition, food and feed processing, flavour, etc.);
Improved availability of and open access to data on breeding methods and legume breeding research outcomes;
Increased competitiveness of the legume breeding sector through cost-effective legume breeding methods, novel governance models, testing, training and networking;
Improved biodiversity and diversification of farming systems and agri-food value chains, as well as increased farmers’ competitiveness through the implementation of crop rotation systems based on the cultivation of legumes;
Improved delivery of environmental services from agriculture, including the reduction of greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions.
Scope:
Legume crops are a source of food, feed and environmental services. For instance, legumes have the unique capacity to fix nitrogen in the soil and therefore improve soil fertility, while at the same time reducing the need to use conventional inorganic fertilisers. Legumes have an important role to play in the transition towards more sustainable farming systems that provide economic, environmental and social benefits and address relevant objectives of the EU biodiversity and farm to fork strategies. In view of the global increase in protein demand, a sustainable diversification of protein sources in the EU and Associated Countries needs to be explored and developed. Legume crops have a significant role to play in this regard. However, for a variety of reasons, legume production in the EU and Associated Countries is not sufficiently developed. Amongst others, a lack of breeding efforts and insufficient use of genetic resources are responsible for the low percentage of arable land currently used for legumes, despite their agronomic and environmental benefits. Closing gaps in breeding (traditional and new varieties) including facilitating knowledge and best practices sharing in legume breeding, can be a key driver for improving the competitiveness of legume crops grown in the EU and Associated Countries.
Proposals should build on the results of relevant EU-funded research projects. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of farmers, the breeding sector and other relevant actors of the value chain. This topic is open for the breeding needs of the legume sector in conventional, agroecological and organic farming, and addresses all climate / biogeographical regions in the EU and Associated Countries. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged. Proposals should include a clear plan to collaborate with other projects selected under this topic. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Proposals should develop a catalogue of legume species and varieties and desired characteristics driven by demands in the EU and Associated Countries food and feed chains. Proposals should develop a range of measures to improve legume varieties for different attributes, such as higher and more stable yields, enhanced tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, resource efficiency, increased nitrogen-fixing capacity (e.g. enhanced use of plant root-microbiome interactions within rhizosphere layer), and enhanced nutritional quality, food and feed processing, etc., through pre-breeding and breeding activities and tapping into local and traditional varieties where relevant. Proposals should improve screening techniques to better understand genetic relationships, origin and susceptibility to specific attributes. Proposals should build an open repository of breeding methods and breeding research outcomes for different attributes. Proposals should analyse the cost-effectiveness of legume breeding methods and identify the best varieties suited for given uses (e.g. crop rotation, extensive agricultural livestock systems, etc.). Case studies of innovative engagement of value chain partners in legume breeding initiatives in different contexts should be analysed and key factors of success should be identified. Governance and financial models should be developed to support legume breeding initiatives that are inclusive for all actors in the value chain and that build linkages among those actors, with a view to strengthening legume demand. Proposals should design training packages tailored to the specific needs of different actors in the legume breeding and seed business to strengthen their capacities to achieve breeding gains. Building on existing tools or mechanisms, where relevant, proposals should set up a transdisciplinary EU and Associated Countries wide platform to facilitate trans-national and trans-regional knowledge and best practices sharing in legume breeding, including facilitating cross-regional testing of varieties. Proposals should foster demonstration and testing of legume breeding in different regions, with emphasis in regions where the legume breeding sector is less developed.

","01 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will support the objective of the biodiversity strategy and the farm to fork strategy to transition to fair, healthy and resilient European agriculture, and contribute to preserve biodiversity and strengthen the resilience and sustainability of specific farming sectors. It will contribute to the impacts related to a better knowledge of the biodiversity decline and of the interrelations between biodiversity, health and climate, as well as to the practices in agriculture supporting biodiversity and other ecosystem services.
The proposed projects are expected to contribute to a better understanding of agroecosystems practices that can sustain honeybees, to enhanced preservation of honeybee genetic resources and their use in breeding, and to mitigation of impacts of beekeeping activities on wild pollinators.
Improved resilience of beekeeping against stresses like climate change, nutritional stresses, pathogens and chemicals;
Support to stakeholders associated with beekeeping, trade, services, monitoring and control through increased knowledge on honeybee immunity and nutrition;
Improved capacity to deal with relevant honeybee pathogens;
Robust evidence-based understanding of the importance of diversity within honeybee populations;
Improved understanding of the impacts of beekeeping activities on wild pollinators and strengthened capacity to address them.
Scope:
Resilience of beekeeping is important both for pollination services and for the honeybee production sector. Bees are subject to numerous biotic and abiotic stressors (e.g. loss of feed resources, exposure to various chemicals, invasive species and/or pathogens) and the impact of climate change on honeybees requires further attention. The biology of honeybees, including immunity and nutrition is still poorly understood, as is the role of genetic diversity within honeybee populations and interactions between honeybees and their environment.
The proposals will address relevant areas of research as appropriate:
Develop technologies and strategies for beekeepers to adapt to climate change and possibly contribute to mitigate climate change, including the design of novel beehives equipment, technologies and management protocols;
Perform baseline studies on immunity, health, nutrition, and genetic diversity and resistance of honeybees in line with their biological performance;
Develop tools for assessing potential impacts of beekeeping on wild pollinators at landscape scale, strategies for mitigating those impacts, and tools tailored to public authorities for planning and decision-making with regard to optimal deployment of bee hives at local or regional level, taking into account among others nutrition requirements and landscape factors;
Address at least Varroa destructor and possibly other honeybee mites, as well as Aethina tumida
Review the key biological mechanisms of Varroa destructor, which determine its multiplication in a hive, including its potential connection with other pathogens, and identify possible novel areas to target with potential new control methods, including bee genetic resistance, especially in light of the experience and limitations of the attempts to fight it in Europe in the last decades;
Assess the vulnerability and preparedness of the EU honeybee-keeping sector in relation to Aethina tumida and Tropilaelaps spp. which are exotic or largely exotic to the EU (A.tumida is present in southern Italy), scrutinise strategies and practices in other countries (outside of EU) where these appeared recently, identify successful practices and suggest mitigation strategies for and by the beekeepers to live with these pathogens, in case of their eventual spread in the EU.
Proposals should include, if appropriate, a genetic component, looking at both the diversity of honeybee populations and the possibility of breeding and conservation approaches to address the identified challenge.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of beekeepers, farmers, agricultural advisory services, manufacturers, the veterinary profession, ecology and nature conservation experts, and other relevant actors."

","28 October 2021
","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The successful proposal will support the delivery of solutions to implement the European Green Deal, the circular economy action plan and the bioeconomy strategy. The topic will support the transition towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just circular economy across regions of Europe at local and regional scale.
The Circular Cities and Regions Initiative’s Project Development Assistance (CCRI-PDA) will be included in the instruments implementing the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI).[1] It will be carried out in close coordination and cooperation with the CCRI.
Investors and lenders need to gain more confidence in investment projects in the field of circular economy which are still seen as risky. European added value can be achieved, for example, where projects introduce innovation to the market regarding financing solutions minimising transaction costs and engaging the private finance community. European added value could also be achieved where projects demonstrably address legal, administrative and other market opportunities and challenges for innovative and sustainable circular economy investment schemes.
CCRI-PDA projects’ results are expected to contribute to the delivery of a series of sustainable circular economy projects and innovative financing solutions/schemes at local and regional scale across Europe.
Scope:
The CCRI-PDA beneficiaries include public and private project promoters such as local and regional authorities or their groupings, public/private infrastructure operators and bodies, utilities and services, industry (including SMEs).
The purpose of the CCRI-PDA is to help project promoters develop their circular economy projects and to bring together the technical, economic and legal expertise needed for developing circular economy investment projects at local and regional scale resulting in the actual launch of investments during the action. Ultimately, CCRI-PDA projects should demonstrate the financial viability and sustainability of circular economy investment projects at local and regional scale and provide tangible showcases that should trigger further market replication.
The CCRI-PDA should provide support for those activities necessary to prepare and mobilise finance for investment projects, such as feasibility studies, stakeholder and community mobilisation, business plans and preparation for tendering procedures or setting up a specific financing scheme/financial engineering.
Proposals could address the development or replication and implementation of innovative financing schemes for circular economy investments at local and regional scale.
The CCRI-PDA should support public and private project promoters to launch investments for activities aimed at increasing circularity in economic sectors that are relevant for the transition towards a sustainable circular economy at local and/or regional scale. The economic sectors involved in each CCRI-PDA service should be selected according to local and/or regional circular economy needs, resources and potential. This selection must be clearly justified and explained.
Proposals should clearly focus their activities on the launch of significant circular economy investments at local and regional scale. The investments should be launched before the end of the action, which means that projects should result in signed contracts with investors for circular economy investments at local and regional scale to that effect.
In addition, proposals should include all following features:
Clearly focus their activities on the launch of significant circular economy investment programmes at local and regional scale;
An exemplary/showcase dimension in their ambition to increase circularity in specific sector(s) at local and regional scale and/or in the size of the expected investments and leverage factors[2];
Delivery of organisational innovation in the mobilisation of the investment programme (e.g. bundling, pooling or stakeholder engagement);
In addition, all proposals should demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results to potential replicators across EU Member States and Associated Countries.
Indicatively, the CCRI-PDA focuses on small and medium-sized circular economy investments of up to EUR 20 million.[3]
The EU contribution per proposal should not exceed 10% of the related investment.
Proposals should justify the budget for the project development assistance needed based on the expected investment portfolio to be set up. This includes the amount of investments that is expected to be triggered and the respective leverage factors to be achieved.
Proposals are expected to ensure synergies and complementarities with other EU financial schemes for circular economy projects. Examples and background information on already existing PDA facilities are available at: https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/project-development-assistance-pda

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Successful proposals will contribute to the impacts of this destination and the European policies it supports, in particular the European Green Deal, the circular economy action plan and the bioeconomy strategy, and engage all stakeholders. They should help improve European industrial[1] sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence by lowering the environmental footprint (including on biodiversity), enabling climate neutrality and higher resource efficiency (in particular upcycling and cascading use of biomass) along value chains, and developing innovative bio-based products.
Projects results should contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Identification of the co-benefits potential risks and upscaling potential of sustainable biomass production with a low potential for Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) with focus on marginal lands[2]. This should include non-edible (industrial) biomass use (such as in biorefineries of various scale and types for climate-neutral circular materials and products); introducing new industrial cropping systems (such as perennial crops).
An improved understanding of the actual available land in the EU Member States and associated countries that could be used for biomass production that can be certified as ‘low ILUC’ for use in bio-based sectors; taking into account increasing resilience to environmental climate change effects such as soil erosion and water stress of the identified crops.
An increased understanding of the biodiversity challenges and potentials, and the ecosystem services, with due attention to protection measures, coupled with end-user adoption and implementation of environmentally sound practices by all operators (farmers, researchers, and bio-based industry active in rural areas). This should include the replication of such practices across Europe.
Improved functional performance of the specific value chains and products, and improved resource efficiency thanks to a better application of the cascading use of biomass.
Scope:
Sustainable biomass provision by primary land sectors (agriculture and forestry), supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation. This will require finding a balance between productivity and ecosystem services, notably biodiversity and social sustainability goals.
The topic explores two main aspects. First, enhancing ecosystem services to prepare for increased water stress and water scarcity due to climate change (including the increasing desertification of large parts of the EU, especially of the Mediterranean and Central European Member States). Secondly, serving multi-purpose and optimised[3] biomass production, with a specific focus on improving biodiversity-related benefits, with opportunities for European rural development and improved industrial competitiveness.
The scope includes identifying and developing environmentally and economically viable sources of pollinator-supporting industrial crops (e.g. by exploring the traits supporting the pollinators such as nectar provision, or resistance to pests and diseases, as well as the optimisation of a related agronomic practice). It also includes identifying and optimising crops (e.g. non-edible oil and fibre crops, dryland shrubs and woody crops) that could be adapted through modern biotechnology tools to require low-water/low-input use, and upscaling them in related value chains, e.g. in industrial sectors such as biochemicals, composites or elastomers, with the aim of replacing their fossil-based counterparts.
The topic aims to engage all relevant actors, especially the farming community, but also bio-based industry and academia, and civil society, calling for working together and co-creation, to develop solutions involving end users and taking into account a comprehensive business case at farm/production level.
Proposals should help to increase farming systems’ resilience to climate change and boost the sustainability of biomass provision through sound agronomic practices, with particular focus on high resource efficiency (including water, and nutrients e.g. via nature-based solutions and biodiversity-friendly solutions) and circular use of biomass and other natural resources.
Proposals may develop key performance indicators and life cycle assessment (LCA) criteria for operators, or identify biodiversity hotspots along the value chains and test them against established benchmarks as part of the overall recommendations.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU Member States and associated countries research projects (especially under the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking and the future Circular Bio-based Europe partnership).
Proposals should:
Identify and evaluate the most suitable feedstock options for different farming systems and pedo-climatic conditions. The agricultural diversity of EU and associated countries should be considered, and the selected options should contribute efficiently to climate change mitigation/adaptation (with a focus on water scarcity and water stress) and biodiversity preservation and enhancement (with special attention to marginal lands under high risk of desertification), while ensuring overall business case viability.
Develop sustainable diversification strategies that can help optimise the production of agricultural feedstock in the emerging bio-based economy (e.g. through intercropping systems, logistics and storage). Identify and produce crops suited to marginal lands. Optimise intermediary/catch crops to increase biomass production sustainably, or optimise perennial crops and short-rotation coppice plantations in annual crops-dominated agricultural production systems.
Identify and implement the best mix of appropriate technical solutions and practices for specific industrial value chains (a proposal should select and justify the choice). The scale-dependent effects on farms and landscapes should be analysed, as well as the barriers and drivers arising from governance and market issues. Make an effort to inform and engage all actors.
Develop and communicate the methods to monitor and measure the qualitative and quantitative impacts of these solutions and practices for different farming systems, the climate neutrality/negativity potential and trade-offs, including for biodiversity, and the associated improvement in farm/business socio-economic resilience.
Develop and test mechanisms with all actors, notably the research community and bio-based industry. Exchange knowledge on and demonstrate solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation, water stress and biodiversity loss (including biotechnology approaches) to rural stakeholders (farmers, foresters) and the broader public, and help them implement them.
International cooperation is encouraged to allow the exchange of best practice while ensuring win-win scenarios and contributing to European competitiveness.

They should contribute to regional, urban and consumer-based transitions towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just circular economy and bioeconomy in Europe at local and regional level.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Sustainable primary production systems to diversify income for farmers, while supporting the development of bioeconomies in rural areas within planetary boundaries.
Targeted policies at EU / national and regional level promoting sustainable agricultural production systems in full respect of biodiversity protection and enhancement objectives.
Improved knowledge of primary producers on co-benefits and potential risks of introducing new production systems.
Better management of the actual available land in EU Member States and associated countries that has been and could be envisaged for biomass production that is certifiable as ‘low induced land use change (ILUC)’ for the use in bio-based sectors[1].
Scope:
Securing long-term supply of affordable and sustainable biomass is a key challenge for the European bioeconomy. It is crucial to limit negative (indirect) changes in land use, which can lead to losses of biodiversity, carbon or other ecosystem services and to move towards a sustainable bioeconomy that operates within sustainable parameters. The diversity and diversification of farming systems can contribute to a sustainable European bioeconomy by securing stable revenues for farmers, lowering negative environmental impacts and increasing resilience to climatic, economic and biological risks.
Proposals will:
Explore alternative systems and designs to improve the overall sustainability of local and regional agricultural production systems in a variety of landscapes, soil and climatic conditions, across the EU and associated countries;
Consider the environmental, economic and social impacts of primary production systems and contribute to the characterisation of diversity and its relation to expected functions and benefits;
Develop sustainable diversification strategies that can optimise the production of agricultural feedstock in the emerging bio-based economy. These could include the co-production of food and non-food products (e.g. through intercropping systems), diversification and optimisation of crops cultivated in greenhouses for high value products, optimisation of intermediary/catch crops to increase the biomass production in a sustainable way and circular low-emission livestock or mixed farming systems.
Optimise diversification strategies for different European agricultural production models/sectors with a view to minimise potential land conflicts and in line with agro-ecological practices.
Consider contributing data and results to the European Commission’s Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy hosted by the JRC.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector and other actors in rural areas.

In line with the European Green Deal, EU bioeconomy strategy and farm to fork strategy, successful proposals will explore opportunities for the valorisation of waste, by- and co-products. They should contribute to regional, urban and consumer-based transitions towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just circular economy and bioeconomy across in Europe at local and regional level.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Strengthened international cooperation with actors from China in the areas of agricultural residues and wastes for circular, biosecure and sustainable bio-based solutions
Establishment of bio-based production systems that are optimised in view of sustainability, circular resource use and economic viability
Increased resource efficiency through reduction of waste and better waste management practices in primary production systems.
Increased opportunities for the valorisation of waste, by- and co-products resulting in environmental and economic benefits for the farming sector (e.g. development of new products and processes).
Improvement in overall environmental performance (soil health, water quality, low-carbon livestock, reduction of emissions, biodiversity, etc.) of bio-based sectors.
Scope:
Agriculture generates co-products, by-products and waste streams that are often not treated adequately in environmental and economic terms. In crop cultivation, losses can be observed at farm and post-harvest levels and downstream along the value chain. Co-products or by-products are generated, for instance in the wine, fruit and vegetable, olive oil, starch and sugar sectors, which offer potential to further valorise the resources. In livestock production, and in particular in large-scale production systems, appropriate management of manure and other waste sources from livestock production and transformation is a challenge. Therefore, this topic addresses opportunities for new processes and concepts that enable innovative uses of these materials while quantifying the impact of deviating biomass streams from their current flow (e.g. in terms of biodiversity impacts, soil fertility, etc.).
Proposals will:
Evaluate existing techniques and develop new innovative approaches for the efficient use of agricultural wastes, co-products and by-products, thereby contributing to the creation of sustainable value chains in the farming and processing sectors.
Address, if applicable, innovative solutions for protein recovery and/or microbial protein production from agricultural wastes/by-products for food and feed applications to meet the demand for new protein-based products at local and global levels.
Examine the safety and risks of circularised substance flows, particularly the reutilisation of food waste and (animal) by-products, and prevention of the creation of pathogen/toxin enrichment cycles and introduction or reconnection of epidemiological pathways.
Demonstrate environmentally-friendly and economically viable approaches in sector-specific case studies and test the possible practical take-up of proposed approaches and technologies.
Examine the synergies/conﬂicts and interdependencies between the different agri-waste feedstock and develop coherent indicators to evaluate their quantity, quality and sustainability attributes, as well as the costs associated with their production, collection and processing.
Consider environmental, economic and social safeguards, such as the sustainable extraction rates of residues, with a view to maintaining low emissions, soil health and fertility, as well as possible conflicts with alternative uses.
Address, if applicable, nutrient and energy recovery and the overall minimisation of environmental impacts in the context of good agricultural practices and possible sanitary implications.
Improve data collection (e.g. data on residue quantities, residue management and feed requirement) at farm-level, link them with relevant information systems (e.g. the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN)) and improve knowledge on the availability, demand and market prices of agricultural waste and residue streams.
Develop training material to endow primary producers and workers with the right skillset in order to adapt to the proposed viable approaches.
Actions will contribute to implementing the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) flagship initiative, which aims to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population, the reduction of food and agricultural losses and waste, and the provision of safe and healthy foodstuffs.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China.

To support the new EU forest strategy, successful proposals will assess research needs and funding possibilities for forestry and the forest-based sector, notably for the multifunctionality and management of forests in Europe based on the three pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental and social). Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Better insights into existing funding sources (including Horizon Europe, rural and regional development funds) and streamlining of research and innovation (R&I) actions in Europe.
Establishment of a co-creative environment allowing stakeholders to identify jointly existing research gaps and future priorities to coordinate research efforts at regional, national and European level.
Intensified trans-national R&I cooperation in forestry and the forest-based sector on research priorities, critical and key technologies.
Creation of an open-innovation ecosystem with relevant stakeholders in the EU and associated countries to support the evolution of the forest-based sector.
Scope:
A key R&I challenge for the coming years is to address the complexity of the forest-based sector in environmental terms (long life cycle, ecosystem functioning and diversity, spatial variability, interface between the soil and the atmosphere, in the middle between cultivated and natural assets), economic terms (multiple forest owners and SMEs, competitiveness on global markets) and policy terms (many forest-related policies including biological diversity, climate and energy, bioeconomy, rural development, trade, agriculture, etc.).
A successful transition of the forest-based sector towards greater sustainability needs to be underpinned by a comprehensive scientific assessment. Better coordination of research activities is also required to overcome fragmentation of public research efforts, to strengthen the link between forest managers, industries and society and to streamline the activities of European, national and regional stakeholders.

Analyse the forest-based sector in an integrated way, considering different biodiversity and bioeconomy issues, societal expectations and climate change risks that call for an intensified European and international collaboration.
Design a suitable method for conducting foresight analysis on issues that are likely to have an impact on forests in European regions and globally.
Consider the future availability of and demands for different forest resources, and assess their sustainability within the changing global economic, social and environmental conditions.
Provide evidence and knowledge on how existing funding sources at EU (including Horizon Europe, rural and regional development funds), Member State, associated countries’ and regional levels are mobilised to support research and innovation initiatives in the forest-based sector.
Address the necessity for new knowledge to support major transitions and innovations in forestry and the forest-based sector in view of the new EU forest strategy and other major policy initiatives.
Develop a structured framework for a European network of research funding and research policy organisations across the different parts of the forest-based and related sectors to increass cross-fertilisation between different areas of knowledge generation and innovation activities.
Develop an R&I roadmap at EU-level and prepare for a possible European partnership or other appropriate comprehensive actions under Horizon Europe.

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal, the EU bioeconomy strategy and the blue growth strategy, the successful proposals will support the development of microbiome-based greener aquatic industrial products/processes and/or environmental services sustaining the health of aquatic ecosystems for a healthy planet and people.
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Provision of a scientific base to enable the efficient production of high‑quality marine microbiome data, increased data interoperability and facilitate its use by a wide range of stakeholders. Improvement of capacity building in bioinformatics in Europe and overcome fragmentation.
Increased engagement of all actors in the marine microbiome biodiscovery pipeline, including industry, the scientific community, and civil society in full consideration of the sustainability objectives while accelerating the profitability and economic prospects of marine microbiome-enabled products and processes.
Proven biodiscovery strategies based on whole microbiome communities enlarging the spectrum of biotechnology-enabled products and processes of value to society based on marine bioresources.
Better protection and sustainable use of marine (genetic) bioresources by advancing new intellectual property rights (IPR) approaches to securing clear access while ensuring fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation.
Increased awareness on the potential of marine microbiome to boost the sustainable blue bioeconomy.
Scope:
The ocean is the Earth’s largest microbiome. Microorganisms represent nearly 90% of the ocean biomass and largely determine the functioning and health of marine ecosystems. They also contain a great variety of metabolic pathways that can yield beneficial products and processes such as medicines, high value industrial compounds and environmental services. The marine microbiome is one of the fastest growing segments of the blue bioeconomy and its study is vital to advance the discovery, understanding, protection and harnessing of the ocean.
The purpose of the action is to develop novel tools and approaches to produce, analyse and use marine microbiome data for the discovery and production of high value sustainable industrial products/processes and/or environmental services that sustain the health of aquatic ecosystems.
Applicants should address:
Scientific and technological challenges cutting across marine microbiome fields such as: (i) developing new methods to analyse and model microbiome communities and take full advantage of post-genomic technologies and bioinformatic analysis pipelines; (ii) developing standards and common methodologies that are coherent across marine microbiome exploration, monitoring and engineering, and can adapt to the capacity of the different sectors (science, industry, people and society); and (iii) optimising the use of (pre-existing) databases and research infrastructures by ensuring interoperability and enhanced networking.
Bioprospecting to discover biological compounds or functions that are obtained only through complex interactions involving whole microbiome communities; targeted cultivation strategies beyond lab grown monocultures; manipulate and bioengineer microbiome products that ensure the sustainable use of marine bioresources; ensure open access and benefit sharing in balance with agreements and negotiations to protect intellectual property.
Collaboration between private industry and academia, and the link with end users and society are both essential. In addition, the professional skills and competences on marine microbiomes of those working and being trained to work within the blue bioeconomy should be improved.
Proposals should assess the risks and ethics related to microbiome science & technology and guarantee the preservation of biodiversity and the compliance with EU regulations on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation (ABS) in the EU. Fostering long-term preservation in biobanks, proper documentation of rights for redistribution and full traceability of their use and benefits.
Dissemination, public engagement and establishing links between researchers and the various end users should be central to the proposals. Projects should seek synergies and capitalise on the results of past or ongoing research. Cooperation with other selected proposals under this topic and complementary topics included in this work programme[1] is encouraged.
International co-operation is strongly encouraged as a win-win scenario, while contributing to the European competitiveness and resilience.

","12 October 2021
","30 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Support objectives of the European Green Deal and of the EU SME Strategy for a sustainable and digital Europe;
Increased resilience of SMEs, by fostering technological and social innovation in SMEs to support their transition to more sustainable business models and more resource-efficient and circular processes and infrastructures;
Increased competitive sustainability of SMEs through the uptake of advanced technologies;
Stronger innovation support ecosystems supporting the green, social and economic transition of SMEs, by leveraging synergies between existing EU networks and SME support initiatives.
Scope:
Achieving European Green Deal objectives, and notably a climate neutral and resource efficient economy, requires the full mobilisation of SMEs. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to companies redesigning their supply chains and facing a new industrial revolution, brought on by a new generation of advanced technologies[1], which are underpinning the potential for competitive sustainability of SMEs.
The action will build on and further connect existing EU specialised business support networks and centres – such as the Enterprise Europe Network, the European industry clusters registered under the European Cluster Collaboration Platform, Centres for Advanced Technologies for Industry. They will work in complementarity and close interaction with Open Innovation Test beds, European Digital Innovation Hubs, Start-up Europe etc., but also with academia, social partners and other social innovation actors.
This action will consist in:
A. Advisory services
Dedicated innovation and capacity building support will be provided to SMEs, to assess their ability to transform their business models and increase their resilience.
This will consist of an assessment of SMEs’ innovation and sustainability practices, elaboration of recommendations, notably in view of the uptake of advanced technologies and/or social innovations.
Based on these recommendations, SMEs could receive further advisory services according to their level of preparedness such as help and advice on proof of concept, investment readiness, intellectual property (in cooperation with EU funded IP support),[2] technology transfer, adaptation to standards, adaptation to environmental rules, design management, skill development, partner search (including social partners). SMEs will receive targeted assistance for the uptake of advanced technologies.
Social innovation should be recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
This action will also include the set-up of a community, building on the SME Alliance projects, in which best practices should be exchanged and SMEs could benefit from dedicated peer-learning activities in order to learn from leaders (SMEs or larger corporates) of their own sector. Incentives for leaders to share their best practices with peers should be identified in the context of EU support to industrial ecosystems.
B. Financial support in the form of ‘Third party financing’
As a result of the advisory services and initial assessments, SMEs will receive financial support through calls for SMEs, to implement the elaborated recommendations.
This should support amongst other activities the financing of a feasibility study, prototyping, pilot testing, demonstrating, procurement of further specialised consultancy services and coaching services that cannot be provided directly by the project partners, adaptation of business processes, free access and support to use testing facilities, introduction of new IT solutions etc.
The Commission estimates that at least half of the budget should be allocated to financial support to SMEs in the form of third party financing.

","12 October 2021
","30 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Bring to the market new green, digital solutions that can increase Europe’s resilience and preparedness to tackle the circular economy and climate challenge, whilst strengthening EU open strategic autonomy in digital technologies;
Advancing public sector modernization by capitalising on the transformational power of digital technologies to bring radical improvements to the quality and efficiency of public services;
Leveraging PCP to drive innovation and increase resilience in the supply chain by opening up opportunities for innovative digitised companies, in particular SMEs and Startups, to access the public procurement market and scale up their business;
Increased opportunities for wide market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side through increased demand for innovative green solutions, wide publication of results and where relevant contribution to standardisation, regulation or certification.
Scope:
By closing the gap between supply and demand in a way that reinforces EU open strategic autonomy, PCPs can make a key contribution to economic recovery and growth[1]. As the future is one of green digital growth[2], European public procurers need to lead by example by procuring more green and more digital. This topic therefore focuses on forward looking procurement of R&D to bring to the market new green, digital solutions that can increase Europe’s resilience and preparedness to tackle the circular economy and climate challenge.
This topic addresses Europe’s Achilles heel on the road towards a green and digital economic recovery, the lack and fragmentation of public demand for innovative solutions[3]. While it is well known that public sector modernisation and economic growth depend heavily on the use of ICTs, European investments on innovation procurement in ICTs are still lagging behind with a factor 3 compared to other leading global economies. Underinvestment is the biggest in particular for R&D procurement (factor 5)[4]. Europe’s startups and SMEs are indispensable in delivering the required innovations. As past experience shows that pre-commercial procurement opens up the procurement market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more effectively, Europe’s Startup community[5] as well as public procurers[6] have requested the Commission and Member States to increase investments in PCP.
This topic supports public buyers to collectively implement PCPs to drive innovation from the demand side and open up wider commercialisation opportunities for companies in Europe to take international leadership in new markets for strategic digital technologies that can deliver greener solutions. The aim is to leverage PCP to encourage the development and to provide a first customer reference for the piloting, installation and validation of breakthrough innovations.
Addressing public sector transformation typically requires combinations of different cross-cutting technologies and cooperation across public sector actors. The topic is thus open to proposals from all domains of public sector activity to address public sector challenges that require innovative ICT based solutions. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific ICT technology, and those requiring end-to-end solutions that need cross-cutting combinations of different ICT technologies. The work will complement PCP Actions foreseen under other topics.
Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project. They should demonstrate how the project is anchored in a clear strategy to fuel economic recovery in a sustainable way through stronger early adoption of innovative green solutions. Activities covered should include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the project.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Innovation Procurement
[1]Impacts of EU funded PCPs show 20%-30% efficiency and quality improvements in public services, doubling of the amount of public procurement directly awarded to startups/SMEs, a factor 20 increase in the amount of cross-border contract award to startups/SMEs and a factor 4 additional financing secured by startups/SMEs. The use of place of performance and IPR/commercialization conditions that fuel commercialization in Europe in PCPs also contributes to EU open strategic autonomy.

","12 October 2021
","30 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Development of organic and hybrid coatings, safe- and sustainable-by-design production strategies with enhanced functionality. This includes organic and hybrid coatings and additives to substitute PFAS type coatings. Due to significant technical and scientific challenges in several areas it has been difficult to find safer alternatives with the absence of hazardous additives. In the past, this has led to substance substitution with compounds that did not avoid the problem, but minimized it. Instead, a better approach is to cover the whole lifecycle of products and include avoidance of hazardous substances and the programming-in of sustainability along the product life cycle.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
A set of computational tools (including first-principles-based, data-driven, physics based and hazard, transport and fate models) to be used for supporting Safe- and Sustainable- by Design of materials (e.g. organic coatings and additives to replace PFAS);
At least 2 novel materials (including bio-based ones) assessed in terms of their performance (function), human and environmental hazards (end-points determined based on the application areas) as well as their carbon and water footprints, recovery and recyclability, and overall environmental impact (LCA). Reaching at least 25% reduction in environmental impacts with <20% cost increase for production;
Contribute to the development of safe- and sustainable-by-design criteria and guiding principles and apply them to organic or hybrid coatings;
Enhance the social acceptance of the new developed materials by evidence basis compiled for consumer attitudes towards, and willingness to pay for, products that are less harmful to the environment, are sustainable, low carbon etc.;
Certification programme (or equivalents) for sustainable containing products, along the whole value-chain;
Integration into standardisation process and development of a roadmap to achieve full standardisation (of e.g. methods, protocols).
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
The largest share of the organic coatings market belongs to a family containing Polyfluorinated Alkyl substances (PFAS), used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. Research will therefore target development of innovative PFAS-free materials with inherently surface active functions to be used for multi-industrial sector applications. (e.g. novel bio-based materials). The proposals should focus on integration of sustainable-by-design aspects including safety (toxicity), circularity and functionality of advanced coating materials and techniques (e.g. nanostructured self-healing or omniphobicity), throughout their lifecycle. Projects should include one or more of the following aspects:
Materials design supported by in silico methods for predicting hazards (toxicity) and fate to reduce additive exposure/leaching to humans and the environment;
Development of alternatives maintaining functionality as well as reducing hazard and/or exposure (persistence) profiles with the aid of modelling, in order to reduce animal and experimental testing;
Development of assays and approaches to demonstrate the reduction of hazard and/or exposure profiles of the new (alternative) advanced materials in a streamlined and robust manner to support route to market.
The proposals, activities and approaches should cover both - specific considerations for the organic and hybrid coatings under study, as well as developing overarching best practices that spans broader sectors of safe- and sustainable-by-design materials. Proposals should involve all the actors in the value chain.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.
Leveraging the extensive experience from relevant initiatives and aligning with other EU-funded projects targeting safe- and sustainable- by-design materials, in particular under CSA topic HORIZON-CL4-2021-RESILIENCE-01-08, is essential.
This topic is open for international cooperation where the EU has reciprocal benefit, while excluding industrial competitors from countries where the safeguarding of IPRs cannot be guaranteed.

Supercapacitors are attractive alternatives to batteries because they can be charged very quickly and can sustain vastly greater number of re-charge cycles than batteries without losing efficiency. However, their power energy is lower than that of batteries but recent material research breakthroughs have indicated that this can be substantially increased. Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
New supercapacitors with energy densities comparable to batteries in environmentally friendly electrolytes able to recharge in a fraction of the time required for current batteries, have no loss of performance over time and longer life;
Substantial impact to energy storage systems solutions for applications ranging from consumer goods to electrification of transport and reduction of emissions;
Innovative management systems for supercapacitors;
Establish new industrial value chains with new energy storage products, tailored to meet the application requirements.
Scope:
Compared to batteries, supercapacitor energy density is low and they use more expensive and critical raw materials (CRMs). Proposals should address the challenge for new material concepts to be used in supercapacitors to at least double the energy density over current technologies reduce cost and minimise or eliminate use of CRMs.

The digital transformation of the European manufacturing industry depends on the availability and uptake of high quality, efficient, affordable and optimised systems, such as those offered by cloud infrastructures, simulation-based twin technologies, data driven approaches. However, there is a low uptake in Europe for such technologies, for example in the case of cloud computing only 1 company in 4 apply it and only 1 in 5 for SMEs[1].
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Support the transition towards industrial digitalisation;
Increase speed of innovation by optimising the use of existing research results and facilitating uptake of new projects results;
Design digital tools for industry (e.g. cloud systems, simulation-based twin technologies, data driven approaches, AI-based and reinforcement learning solutions) to enhance efficiency and product quality, as well as to increase the capability for better and faster reaction to market changes;
Contribute to the development of advanced material modelling solutions in particular for manufacturing industry;
Enhance data interoperability and new type of services related to the data analysis, simulations and/or visualisation techniques in each stage of the material value chain (design, processing, manufacturing, etc.) using FAIR data principles.
Scope:
Digital tools can enable industry to control manufacturing processes and address issues more efficiently and effectively as they run and update the production plant, while improving key product and production performance indicators such as yield and throughput.
Proposals under this topic have to
design robust digital tools integrating materials modelling and materials process development for industry;
promote use and adaptation of existing tools and process developments that are applicable to different sectors;
contribute also to the development of simulation and optimisation methods to facilitate more efficient design space exploration via experimentation, thereby reducing physical testing and improving quality;
enhance efficiency of the manufacturing process;
improve process and product quality;
improve decision making efficiency, quality and understanding, while at the same time maintaining low operational costs.
Interconnection between processes and other industries is also in the scope, as there is an increased integration of different domains and disciplines in complex workflows. To overcome the problem, proposals have to address interoperability by implementing available data standards like MODA, CHADA and ontologies like EMMO, as well as cooperation with the Industry Commons developments.
The proposed use cases for the developed tool should demonstrate the business case and how more sustainable solutions are achieved in the market, for example by reducing waste and/or emissions during production. A Life Cycle Assessment should be included to estimate the environmental improvement, together with a Life Cycle Cost assessment to demonstrate the lower operational costs.

Reinforce the activities in the long term the AU-EU HLPD CCSE Partnership.
Provide knowledge and scientific modelling as evidence base of the water-energy-food-nexus including the environmental, social and economic trade-offs to contribute to R&I strategy and policy making.
Increase clean energy generation in the African energy systems.
A sustained network of African experts and expertise in this area.
Improve in the long-term governance to advance knowledge and scientific modelling of the water energy food nexus including the environmental, social and economic trade-offs (governance aspects should be included since they are under-represented in the current research works).
Scope:
The topic is contributing to the activities of the AU-EU High Level Policy Dialog (HLPD) Climate Change and Sustainable Energy (CCSE) partnership. Climate changes and increase usage of water in all economic activities create more stresses on water use for energy generation. Energy generation covers in this context energy from renewable sources and energy vectors such as electricity, heat and fuels. Therefore the needs for African countries of having their own dedicated models to simulate and estimate the stresses on the water-energy nexus are crucial for their policy decision and energy planning. International agreement and trade issues can be considered in the model. Most of the current models are based on developed country standard and usage.
The proposal should then develop and test models for decision makers and planners to implement energy infrastructures and energy supply in Africa which safeguard a systemic approach to the water-energy food nexus. These models can be based on existing reliable source codes and models. The test should be made on the case of an existing African water basin. Participation of societal stakeholders is considered important
Actions should promote the highest standards of transparency in model adoption, going beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, architecture, code and data. The outcome of the project should be widely disseminated and the source code of the model should be open access to stimulate future development. To ensure future uses, African experts in water-energy nexus and in model development should be full partners in the project. The project should identify further local training needs.
The project should also link with existing European activities to create synergies and cross-fertilisation. The project should participate in the activities of the HLPD CCSE partnership.

Proposals will develop hybrid catalytic conversion processes, combining chemical, electrochemical, biological, biochemical and thermochemical catalytic processes to convert renewable energy to carbon-neutral renewable fuels of biological or non-biological origin (other than hydrogen), and which respond to longer-term future demands for high energy density carriers in sectors relying on liquid fuels. The development and combination of novel catalysts and linked lab-scale components and/or systems which improve significantly the performance regarding conversion efficiency for best atomic economy and specific marginal cost reduction should be addressed. Development of catalysts and/or systems with dual function, e.g. catalyst/sorbent or other, may be included. Combination of at least two different catalysts types into a single multicatalytic material as appropriate should be addressed. Improvements as regards the conversion of a broader variety of molecules from the same feedstock and the broader application of hybrid catalytic systems in up-scaled processes should be examined. Maximizing GHG emissions abatement in the conversion process should be aimed. International cooperation is encouraged. Combination of H2 production by electrolysis and its separate use for catalytic conversion of CO2 is not covered by this topic.

Enhancing the ability to ascertain whether and to what extent emission reduction efforts are producing the desired atmospheric signals for key greenhouse gases on relevant spatial and temporal scales.
Better understanding of apparent discrepancies between reported greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals (in national inventories and other schemes), measured atmospheric signals and modelled levels, with the aim of reducing and/or reconciling them on the long run.
Reduced uncertainty of national GHG inventories through improved comparability with models and observations and piloting top-down approaches recognised in the 2019 refinement of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
Contribution to improving the attribution of GHG fluxes (anthropogenic vs natural) as well as non-GHG atmospheric climate forcers (such as aerosols), including feed-backs.
Support the Paris Agreement, in particular the Global Stocktake, and the implementation and monitoring of EU climate policy instruments.
Provide input (such as open data, models, methods and protocols) and contributions to international programmes and assessments (such as IPCC, Global Carbon Project).
Scope:
Actions should aim at reconciling national greenhouse gas inventories with relevant assessment and monitoring systems in Europe (in particular EU and Horizon Europe Associated Countries) including observations from a wide range of monitoring networks, in-situ and remote-sensed) at a range of scales by comparing their results. Aerosols and their precursors should also be included in the analysis, as well as other air pollutants where relevant (e.g., co-emitted species).
Special attention should be given to establishing how the use of top-down techniques that can support the verification of national greenhouse gas inventories and other regulated estimates of emissions and removals, in order to improve or supplement the methods/approaches currently used. Ideally case studies in collaboration with one or more national inventory compilers should be organised for this purpose.
Proposals should aim to develop scientifically robust methodologies, building on achievements from previous research activities in order to decrease to acceptable levels uncertainties associated with emission estimates, identify and constrain irreducible differences and improve the attribution of emissions and removals to their sources (in particular the separation of natural versus anthropogenic fluxes). They should also explore and support the development and implementation of top-down approaches for use in national inventories, as recognised in the 2019 Refinement of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
The development and improvement of methodologies should also address the need for versatility of applications, including mobile sources, individual point sources, land, management actions etc. relevant to current and potential future reporting and compliance systems. Furthermore, issues such as open data and metadata standards, transfer of information and tools, and replicability of methodologies and tools outside Europe (mainly in developing countries) should also be addressed.

Successful proposals will support the uptake of bio-based innovation with high environmental and functional performance of products, processes and services along value chains and life cycles by bio-based industry, in line with European Green Deal objectives. Project outcomes will contribute to foster European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence, by lowering the environmental footprint and enabling climate-neutrality and higher resource efficiency along value chains.
Projects results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
Bio-based plastics value chains are deployed with improved functionalities and environmental performances, less toxicity substances, lower waste production and better product safety control along the whole value chain.
Scope:
There is a need to develop innovative, sustainable bio-based and biodegradable plastics with novel properties and production processes to deliver environmentally friendly materials with the desired properties for long-term circular applications, markets and uses. The approach should combine environmental sustainability, circularity and functionality of the developed products and of the supply chain. Results should be aligned to recent policy developments on plastics.
Proposals should:
Develop novel sustainable bio-based biodegradable plastics with enhanced functionalities, circularity and environmental sustainability, based on their non-toxic nature and improved end-of-life behaviour, for specific applications. The bio-based plastic should be mechanically recyclable and its biodegradability in specific environments should allow for a more sustainably managed end-of-life such as either composting or anaerobic digestion or home composting or in ‘in-situ’ degradation (i.e. natural soil and marine environments) depending on applications and conditions.
Develop and optimise innovative aspects of the production process, for example green chemistry and/or fermentative production, especially with respect to catalysts, higher yield, bio-based plastic quality, while ensuring the sustainability of biological feedstock used in the manufacturing, including biological waste and residues, and of production processes, aiming at a low environmental footprint and economic viability.
Test the biodegradability in the specific environment where the bio-based plastic developed for selected applications and conditions could end its life cycle, i.e. either composting plant or anaerobic digester, or home composting, or in ‘in-situ’ degradation (i.e. natural soil and marine environments);
Consider process and product safety (i.e. production through to the use of a product) in value chains, especially for new products and materials, following national or EU regulations. The toxicological evaluation of products and the EU regulatory requirements for product safety should be systematically addressed as part of proposals/projects, in particular where uses may be linked to critical exposure routes (e.g. food contact materials).
Demonstrate the scaled-up production processes and cost competitiveness for novel sustainable bio-based biodegradable plastics in order to reach a critical mass for a given bio-based plastic, to achieve economies of scale.
Proposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded within this topic. Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and to capitalise on the results of past and other ongoing research projects. They should take a multidisciplinary approach, involving many stakeholders and fields of applications and considering various aspects along the bio-based plastics value chain, including EU rules on product safety. They should also consider contributing data and results to the European Commission’s Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy hosted by the JRC.

They will help improve European industrial[1] sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence to develop innovative bio-based products. They will engage all stakeholders and improve their knowledge and understanding of science, notably of biotechnology-based value chains, and improve benefits for consumers.
Projects results should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Wider application of recent advances in molecular biology and biotechnology to increase photosynthetic efficiency of plants and/or algae and other autotrophic organisms, increasing their assimilation of carbon dioxide, boosting biomass yields, their processing and recovery of substance and materials of economic interest, and resulting in potential contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Increased industrial uptake of plants and photoautotrophic organisms via biotechnology approaches, for the production of high-value complex molecules, to improve cost- and resource-efficiency. Wider uptake of life sciences and biotechnology innovations, supporting high engagement of industry and SMEs in Europe.
Greater understanding and application of biotechnology to address air pollution (especially ozone) by crops and plants related with heat waves and environmental stress.
Greater and more inclusive understanding and awareness of innovations, via transparent communication and societal dialogue with all stakeholders (academia, industry, SMEs, NGOs, regulatory institutions, international partners etc.).
Scope:
The photosynthetic capacity of plants, algae and other photosynthetic organisms to assimilate atmospheric carbon dioxide positions them at the centre of the global climate change adaptation and mitigation challenge[2] [3]. Their autotrophic lifestyle also makes them ideal platform organisms for sustainable production of biomolecules[4], including molecules of high socio-economic value, of interest to diverse industrial sectors, by increasingly sophisticated synthetic and molecular biology approaches[5].
This creates new opportunities for industrial production, beyond improved yields, while helping increase CO2 assimilation capacity - contributing notably to the reduction of pollution in Europe, and making it more efficient. In particular, recent research confirm a strong correlation between plant physiological reactions during drought and heat waves, which are increasing in frequency and intensity in Europe, notably by contributing to ozone pollution[6], the so-called ‘climate penalty of plants” [7] [8].
The topic covers innovative technologies with potential to boost the efficiency of photosynthesis, reduce the ‘climate penalty of plants’, and increase their sustainable industrial application. All photoautotrophic organisms such as plants, micro- and macro algae, cyanobacteria and purple sulphur bacteria are in the scope.
International cooperation is strongly encouraged to allow the exchange of best practices while ensuring win-win scenarios and contributing to European competitiveness.
Proposals should:
Develop and apply a toolbox of technologies to optimise the photosynthesis pathways and structures of plants and algae to enable industrial manufacturing of large quantities of high-value bio-based compounds, substances or materials (excluding biofuels/bioenergy applications), while addressing the CO2 assimilation and the zero-pollution goals (especially ozone pollution) at sufficiently large scale.
Identify and characterise the key aspects of the environmental and safety aspects, as well as the future scenarios of increasing environmental pressures under climate change conditions (water, gaseous inputs, land use etc.), for the selected crops, beyond the model species.
Outline the necessary scale-up production processes for novel bio-based innovations in order to reach a critical mass for a given application (including the crop/species selection), to achieve economies of scale, address different market segments and applications.
Consider process and product safety - including the occupational and consumer safety aspects - in value chains, in line with national or European regulationsEnsure the transparent and inclusive engagement of all actors, including industry and SMEs, the scientific community, regulatory institutions, and broader civil society, including NGOs, to ensure the necessary impact and awareness.

In line with the EU forest strategy and the European digital strategy, successful proposals will demonstrate the potential of digital solutions in forestry and forest-based value chains contributing to the multifunctionality and management of forests in Europe based on the three pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental and social). Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Deployment of information and communication technology (ICT) innovations in forestry to optimise productivity as well as the delivery of ecosystem services.
Application of innovative approaches along the forest-based value chain by more accurate tracing methodologies of forest resources.
A greater competitive advantage for European industries that utilise forest resources more efficiently.
Scope:
The improved use of information flows and intelligent digital solutions that are increasingly available in forest monitoring, management and forestry operations, could help to significantly improve and unlock the efficiency of wood supply chain activities. Modern digital applications also provide promising possibilities to improve forest managers’ decision making in a precious and complex forest environment and to improve ecosystem monitoring.
This topic addresses innovations in information systems for forest managers, forest-based industries and policy makers as well as advances in precision forestry, harvesting systems and forest nursery operation, optimised harvest planning, operations management, timber transport and logistics, as well as safety, ergonomics and smart assistance for human workers. The synergetic use of geo-spatial, statistical, and modelling technologies together with information and communication technologies such as aerial and satellite retrievals, (in particular from the Copernicus programme) and the ‘web of things’ combined with big-data analytics is highly encouraged.
The aim is to harness the potential of ICT and new technologies to improve the sustainability of forest management and logging operations with a view to sharing data throughout the wood value chain, thereby driving greater sustainability, to offer new business models along the value chain and to improve the traceability of forest resources for optimised and transparent supply chains. The integration in the new technologies of climate change impacts on these wood chains should be an essential component. Activities may also include robust and transparent methods and tools for high resolution forest and ecosystems services assessments, natural disturbance risk monitoring and analysis (including pests and forest fires) and disaster response systems.
Besides activities such as prototyping, testing, demonstrating and piloting in a near to operational environment, proposals may include limited research activities. Assessing and deepening the understanding of economic, social and environmental impacts through an enhanced application of digital technologies for foresters, small and medium-sized enterpirses (SMEs) and industries, as well as end-consumers will be of special interest, including the assessment of risks and opportunities for jobs in forestry, the wider forest-based sector and rural communities.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the primary sector and the wider forest-based value chain. Cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged.

In line with the European Green Deal and other European initiatives such as the circular economy action plan, the industrial strategy, the bioeconomy strategy and the biodiversity strategy, the successful proposal should support the uptake of bio-based innovation, to improve European industrial[1] sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence. They should develop innovative bio-based products using the full benefits of artificial intelligence and other digital technology innovation. They should engage all stakeholders and improve their knowledge and understanding of science, notably biotechnology-based value chains, and improve benefits for consumers.
Project results tshould contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Use the full potential of artificial intelligence applications for prospecting, understanding and sustainably using biological resources within safe planetary boundaries.
Digital tools, sensors and methods for improved efficiency, climate change adaptation and sustainability of industrial processes in the bio-based sectors considering the needs of stakeholders are integrated in innovative engineering solutions.
Enhanced monitoring, reporting and management of natural resources using artificial intelligence and other digital technology applications.
Scope:
Engineering biology applications have grown beyond chemical production to include the generation of biosensor organisms for the lab, animal, and field, modification of agricultural organisms for nutrition and pest/environmental resilience, production of organisms for bioremediation, and live cell and gene/viral therapies. The rapid expansion of the field has resulted in new tools and new approaches. However, we are still challenged by the need for novel and more robust and interoperable computational tools and models for engineering biology. For example, improved models of synthetic systems (synthetic biology) and of their interaction with their host organisms could help enable more successful engineering.
This information infrastructure for biological design is at an early stage compared to engineering disciplines such as mechanical and electrical engineering, as the biomanufacturing field has emerged only recently. A critical bottleneck is a lack of established “design rules,” core aspects of biological and biomolecular function that apply to diverse systems and applications. Furthermore, technologies for the utilization, manufacture, and deployment of innovative bio-based systems are still under development. These roadblocks have hampered the development of standard computational frameworks to represent, process and store information on biological components, predict system behaviour, and diagnose failures. Therefore, widespread automation in the bio-based sectors remains out of reach.
A mature computational infrastructure for biodesign requires powerful access to information on biological parts and systems, their environments, their manufacturing processes, and their operations in and beyond the laboratory in which they are created. This in turn requires findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data that enable effective aggregation information on bio-based systems, their environments, and their processes of manufacture, and the establishment of standard models of data processing and analysis, including bioinformatics, biosensors, bioindicators, ‘-omics’ technologies that allow open-development and scalable execution in the bio-based sectors.
The topic aims to prevent pollution and sustainably manage and use natural resources within safe planetary boundaries, including in the deployment of the bioeconomy and the bio-based sectors. The topic focuses on bioinformatics, “cheminformatics” and artificial intelligence as approaches and tools to transform available information into biologically or biotechnologically applicable knowledge. It also aims to efficiently integrate digital technologies into bio-based operations to optimise value chains from a technical, economic, social and environmental point of view.
Proposals should:
Enable prospecting, understanding and sustainable use of biological resources based on their convergence with digital technologies that lead to optimised and more efficient bio-based operations.
Identify and characterise advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and their benefits for the utilisation, manufacture, and deployment of innovative bio-based systems.
Develop integrated biological designs and data models for improved prospecting, understanding and deployment of higher efficiency and sustainability of biological resources and industrial bio-based operations (e.g. bioinformatics, biosensors, bioindicators, data analysis, ‘-omics’ technologies).
Improve the economic and environmental sustainability of bio-based operations.
Focus on the integration of -omics and machine learning techniques such as active learning for the design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle.
Develop improved models and model standards of synthetic systems (synthetic biology) and of their interaction with their host organisms to facilitate more successful engineering and broader application in the bio-based sectors.
Establish bio computer-aided design (BioCAD) tools and design-of-experiment (DoE) approaches.

","28 October 2021
","01 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will contribute to all Destination ‘Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors’ impacts related to consumers and industry, in particular to European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence by lowering the environmental footprint, enabling climate-neutrality and higher resource efficiency, through increased circularity and a resulting reduction in GHG emissions.
Project results are expected to contribute to at least four of the following outcomes:
Increased deployment and market uptake of innovative climate-neutral circular solutions for construction, waste prevention, lifetime extension and significant improvement of lifecycle performance of buildings and their components, including GHG emissions
Increased deployment and market uptake of innovative solutions to design and manufacture for disassembly, waste prevention and management, reuse and recycling in the construction sector, including production and assembling
Enhanced diffusion and demonstrated benefits of advanced digital solutions, ensuring coherence with other initiatives such as digital logbooks for logistics of construction materials and the energy-efficient operation of buildings
Increased recovery and recycling rates of construction and demolition waste
Improved elimination of hazardous substances from secondary materials
Increased upcycling of reused and recycled material in construction materials, products and buildings
Increased knowledge about the overall environmental footprint of buildings and construction materials, including the integrated assessment of material and energy efficiency with regard to possible trade-offs and synergies, and increased practical application of the Commission’s Product Environmental Footprint method.
Scope:
The 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP) states that “the built environment has a significant impact on many sectors of the economy, on local jobs and quality of life. It requires vast amounts of resources and accounts for about 50% of all extracted material. The construction sector is responsible for over 35% of the EU’s total waste generation. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from material extraction, manufacturing of construction products, construction and renovation of buildings are estimated at 5-12% of total national GHG emissions. Greater material efficiency could save 80% of those emissions.” Measures should strive for the use of more climate-neutral circular materials with low environmental footprint and tackle material recovery, upcycling, recycled content in products, durability and adaptability of buildings, and they should have a strong life cycle and digitalisation focus. They should also focus on circular design that facilitates reuse and recycling beforehand.
This activity should demonstrate at large scale and deploy innovative climate-neutral circular solutions that prevent waste, expand the lifetime and improve the life cycle performance of buildings and their components, but also improve the quality of and the confidence in reused and recycled material. This targets materials, products, equipment and systems, their sourcing, design, upgradability, durability, material efficiency, dismantling, recyclability, etc. Dismantling and deconstruction should be embedded already in the design phase, with the adoption of circular economy principles, and thus reduce construction and demolition waste (CDW). As part of an overall digitalisation of the construction ecosystem, projects should use digital tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) or Digital Twin, which are key to traceability and circularity, and can be further used during deconstruction. Appropriate material recycling within construction operations, waste material identification, sorting and decontamination solutions should be considered to improve material logistics, processing and upgrading. Projects should aim to support the strengthening of preferably local or regional secondary material markets. All solutions should be based on life-cycle approaches and proposals should integrate life cycle assessment using the European Commission’s Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method and relevant costing methods. The projects should also propose, test and demonstrate new business models. Projects should also develop training material to endow workers in this occupational group with the right skillset in order to deploy the new technologies developed. All achieved outcomes should be demonstrated using quantitative indicators and targets wherever possible.
With regard to the territorial aspects of all proposed solutions, proposals seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). Joint activities with CCRI projects are encouraged.
Proposals should seek to build synergies with projects funded under Cluster 4 Destination ‘Climate neutral, circular and digitised production’, section “A new way to build, accelerating disruptive change in construction”. Projects are therefore strongly encouraged to organise joint activities, ensure synergies and undertake clustering activities with projects under Cluster 4.
Projects should seek to contribute to the New European Bauhaus initiative by supporting the green and digital transitions in communities’ living environments through merging sustainability, inclusiveness and quality of experience.

In this context, a KIC must develop and implement a revenue-generating strategy to maintain its innovation ecosystem and activities beyond the period during which the EIT provides financial support through grant agreements.
In pursuing financial sustainability, the KIC should look for a diversification of its revenue and investment sources by mobilising funds from other public and private sources and to attract and engage the widest possible range of relevant new partners. The KIC should aim to maximise the share of contributions from public and private sources and from income generated by its activities and to pursue and achieve financial sustainability at the latest before the expiry of the Partnership Agreement (see section 2.8) with the EIT.
The EIT Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) is mandatory for all KICs and an integral part of their multi-annual strategies. EIT RIS activities aim to improve the innovation capacity of countries, and regions in those countries, which are classified as modest and moderate innovation performers according to the European Innovation Scoreboard, as well as the Outermost Regions, and foster the integration of new partners from those countries and regions into the KIC’s communities. The KIC’s EIT RIS activities should be aligned with the EIT RIS Implementation Framework (2022-2027) and deliver on the EIT RIS objectives presented in the EIT legislative framework.
In addition, a KIC is expected to take part in the HEI) Initiative helping higher education institutions to build their capacity to innovate and to teach innovation and entrepreneurship.
Objective:
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is a key driver of sustainable European economic growth and competitiveness. It reinforces the innovation capacity of the EU and its Member States to address the grand challenges facing European society.
During the 2021 to 2027 period, the EIT contributes to the general objectives of Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation by integrating the entrepreneurship-driven ‘Knowledge Triangle’ of business, higher education and research to boost disruptive innovation across Europe.
To further enhance its impact and to incentivise the innovations needed to meet new societal challenges, the EIT will, as established in the EIT Regulation and EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA) 2021-2027, gradually expand its portfolio of Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). With this Call for Proposals, the EIT launches the selection process for a new KIC in the thematic area of cultural and creative sectors and industries.
Scope:
The EIT KIC will be an integrated partnership bringing together leading companies, higher education institutions, research organisations and other stakeholders in the innovation process to tackle pressing societal challenges through the development of products, services and processes and also by nurturing innovative, entrepreneurial individuals. The KIC connects excellence-driven innovation hubs, the Co-location Centres to become leading centres of excellence, competing and collaborating with other innovation hubs across the world.
The KIC is expected to follow a long-term innovation and impact-driven strategy, operating with a business logic and a results-oriented approach to contribute to the achievement of the EIT’s overall mission, the priorities laid down in the EIT Strategic Agenda 2021-2027 and the attainment of the general objectives established in Horizon Europe.
Creativity is a key driver of innovation and a KIC on CCSI has the capacity to unleash the potential of artistic, culture-based creativity and to help strengthen Europe’s competitiveness, sustainability, prosperity and smart growth. A KIC on Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries (CCSI) shall address the major economic and societal challenges within the specific sector as referred to in the EIT Strategic Agenda 2021-2027. The EIT does not pre-define the strategic sub-areas eligible within the field of CCSI leaving it to applicants to propose focus areas in their strategies. For more information on the scope and theme for this new EIT Knowledge and Innovation Community, please download the factsheet.
The KIC will deliver a whole range of world-class activities bringing together actors from different sides of the Knowledge Triangle (business, education and research) encompassing the whole innovation value chain within cultural and creative sectors and industries. The KIC’s portfolio of activities will include, inter alia: entrepreneurial education and training programmes, research-driven innovation projects, and incubation of and support to start-ups and scale-ups.
Expected Impact:
The KIC should harvest intellectual, human, material and financial resources to create valuable outputs such as innovation communities, high quality curricula, start-ups, innovative products, services, technologies, through which it develops and sustains value-added business, enhances competencies necessary for innovation and entrepreneurship, and for developing solutions to major societal challenges.
The KIC is expected to create the following impact:
technological/economic/innovation impact by influencing the creation and growth of companies, as well as the creation of new innovative solutions to address the global challenges, creating direct and indirect jobs and mobilising additional public and private investments;
scientific and educational impact by, strengthening human capital in research and innovation, enhancing innovative and entrepreneurial skills both at individual and organisational levels and fostering the creation and diffusion of knowledge and innovation openly within society;
societal impact, including the impact derived by the delivery of systematic solutions within and beyond the EIT Community, also through Cross-KIC activities, by addressing EU policy priorities in the cultural and creative sectors and industries (CCSI) through innovative solutions, engagement with citizens and end-users and by strengthening the uptake of innovative solutions in these areas in society.
This KIC approach to building systemic impact should be aligned with and contribute to Horizon Europe impact pathway approach as well as the EIT Impact Framework KPIs.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
The EU contributes strongly to global standards for health data through enhancement of common European standards for health data (including medical imaging data) by researchers and innovators. Researchers and innovators contribute to GDPR compliant guidelines and rules for data anonymisation.
Innovators have access to advanced secure data processing tools to test and develop robust data-driven digital solutions and services in response to the needs of researchers, clinicians and health systems at large.
Cross-border health data hubs further facilitate the innovation process by providing secure, trustable testing environments for innovators.
Clinicians, patients and individuals use a larger variety of high quality data tools and services for wellbeing, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of care.
Researchers and innovators have more opportunities for testing and developing GDPR compliant data driven solutions based on actual needs of the health care environments.
Scope:
It is essential to speed up and facilitate innovations in the field of data-driven tools and services for wellbeing, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of care, among others. However, limited access by developers to health data and secure testing environments hinder the development of innovative data-driven digital health products and services.
Therefore, the proposals are expected to scale up multi-party computation, data anonymisation techniques and synthetic data generation. To ensure privacy, the data analytics should be conducted in a distributed way among processors that grant third parties access to analysis outcomes but not to the underlying data. The developers should have access to distributed testing data sources and cloud and computing resources at large scale, with a view to improving the speed and robustness of multi-party computation solutions for innovators. The aim is to allow secure GDPR-compliant data processing for research, and clinical purposes.
The proposals should consider the use of synthetic, i.e. artificially generated, data as they allow researchers and developers to test, verify and fine-tune algorithms in large-scale data experimentations without re-identifiable personal data.
In addition, the proposed anonymisation techniques will have to be sophisticated and robust enough to tackle the challenge of anonymised data sets that still make it possible to trace back to individuals.
The proposals are expected to foster the development of secure, interoperable, transparent - and therefore trustable - cross-border health data hubs that can facilitate the provision of the required testing environments for innovators. This will support the uptake of new data tools, technologies and digital solutions for health care.
To this end, integration of national/regional health data hubs/repositories/research infrastructures is appropriate to achieve the scope of the topic. The proposals are expected to address all of the following areas:
Consolidate and scale up multi-party computation and data anonymisation techniques and synthetic data generation to support health technology providers, in particular SMEs.
Support the development of innovative unbiased AI based and distributed tools, technologies and digital solutions for the benefit of researchers, patients and providers of health services, while maintaining a high level of data privacy.
Advance the state-of-the-art of de-identification techniques, to tackle the challenge of anonymised datasets that can be traced back to individuals.
Develop innovative anonymisation techniques demonstrating that effective data quality and usefulness can be preserved without compromising privacy.
Explore and develop further the techniques of creating synthetic data, also dynamically on demand for specific use cases.
Widen the basis for GDPR-compliant research and innovation on health data.
Ensure wide uptake and scalability of the methodologies and tools developed, promote high standards of transparency and openness, going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, architecture, code and any underlying data."

The proposals should adhere to the FAIR data[1] principles, adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, wherever relevant. In addition, proposals are encouraged to adopt good practices of international standards used in the development of computational models, and make available the tools and solutions developed early. Proposals aiming to develop computational models of high technology readiness level are encouraged to deliver a plan for the regulatory acceptability of their technologies. Early interaction with the relevant regulatory bodies is recommended (i.e. the EMA qualification advice for new technologies, etc.) for the proposals contributing to the development of new medicinal products, improvement of the effectiveness of marketed products and the development of medical devices. The proposals aiming to validate their models as high-risk medical devices in the relevant clinical environment are encouraged to deliver a certification implementation plan.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Individuals, researchers, health services and the workforce across borders in the EU Digital Single Market use significantly improved and interoperable cross-border digital health solutions thanks to sophisticated ICT toolbox, representative use case applications, a Pan-European ecosystem of early adopters, and a framework for sustainability and exploitation. These will also contribute to the European Health Data Space.
Individuals have an improved level of accessibility, control and portability of health data, including donation for research across Europe and jurisdictions.
Policy makers and members of the eHealth Network[1] are better informed and advised regarding potential evolutions of the EEHRxF and its extension to other uses cases.
Different target populations such as designers, developers, health care professionals, and individuals have access to exploitation and capacity building support, such as training material, dedicated tools, guidelines, mentorship and collaboration programs.
Scope:
Interoperability of Electronic Health Record is key for the exchange and the portability of health data in view of better health outcomes and treatments. The EU has supported projects to ensure cross-border sharing of health data and, in 2019, adopted a Recommendation on EEHRxF[2]. There is a need to continue supporting the uptake of new use cases (i.e. laboratory results, medical imaging and reports, and hospital discharge reports) and take on board possible new requirements, and ultimately to bring together policy actors and stakeholders.
Applicants should propose activities in all of the following areas:
Building on the outcomes of activities and projects[3] related to the EEHRxF Recommendation, establishing and sustaining a scalable public infrastructure for digital health innovation based on the EEHRxF principles and the functional and technical specifications of its information domains (i.e. medical imaging, discharge letters, laboratory results, etc.). This infrastructure must provide a REST API[4] to third-party developers, which should comprise a coherent set of functionality that significantly improve the development and deployment of interoperable cross-border digital health solutions. It should specifically allow individuals accessing and providing their own (electronic) health records across national borders. The infrastructure must ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation[5], the Network and Information Systems Directive[6] and the operation in a European Digital Single Market.
Demonstrating feasibility of real-life interoperable digital solutions for use by individuals, researchers, health services and the workforce across borders in the EU Digital Single Market by leveraging the above EEHRxF-based infrastructure. Emphasis should be given to specific fields of high societal relevance and high prevalence. Omics type of information associated to the use and exchange of health datasets and artificial intelligence should be strongly considered with special regard to analysis and corresponding further health-related data. Integration with population-based patient registries such as cardiovascular disease, congenital anomalies, diabetes, rare diseases, and cancer are highly recommended. Relevant activities of the eHealth Network[7] should be taken into account. For all relevant data (e.g. from hospitals, doctors or user-generated) ethics and legal issues should be considered appropriately. Local, regional, national and cross-border aspects (to cover e.g. differences in languages and terminologies) should be given adequate consideration.
Establishing and sustaining a Pan-European ecosystem of digital health stakeholders by promoting and ensuring adoption of the EEHRxF-based infrastructure, involving both supply and demand sides, reinforcing collaboration and networking between the different actors working on digital health innovation across Europe around that infrastructure, and more particularly ensuring strong involvement and coordination at the governance level with the national authorities and Ministries represented in the eHealth Network and the eHealth agencies underneath it. The latter should include innovation initiatives related to a coherent selection of the following: clinical research, clinical trial integration, outcomes-based research, monitoring or decision aids for individuals, and business analytics, as well as application designers and developers, SMEs, innovation hubs, professionals networks e.g. rare disease network, health professionals and patient associations, and standardisation bodies.
Creating and validating a framework for enabling further exploitation of the public infrastructure for digital health innovation, including its terms of reference, governance and operations rules and procedures, as well as support for capacity building such as training material, guidelines, mentorship and collaboration/twinning programs for designers, developers, health care professionals, policymakers, SMEs, etc.

Scope:
Proposals may be submitted in any of the following areas:
Improved emergency disaster risk management and societal resilience. EGNSS solutions for critical services related to detection, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation of emergencies and disasters, introducing synergies between satellite navigation, earth observation and communications. In particular, the synergies with the Copernicus Emergency Response Service, which is already operational, should be exploited. EGNSS solutions that leverage Search and Rescue service for resilience and management in crisis situations, following a disaster where conventional means, e.g. telecommunications, are no longer working. Further promising areas include mapping and high accuracy navigation for response and recovery, more intelligent and accurate distress beacons for Save and Rescue, drone and robot operations for disaster response, GNSS/Copernicus-based earthquake early warning systems, and Helicopter Emergency Medical Services.
Timing and synchronisation applications focussing on emerging network synchronisation needs of critical infrastructures (electricity, telecommunications, financial etc.) in terms of accuracy and robustness, while reducing EU dependency on other GNSS. Proposals may e.g. focus on increasing receiver resilience to interference, increasing resilience and reliability in the reception of GNSS signals, tighter and more accurate time/phase requirements, timing precise synchronisation between financial platforms, Critical Assets Monitoring and Data Centre resistance against spoofing data; telecommunication networks’ operation; small cell synchronisation and 5G; Energy distribution and Phasor Measurement Units for smart grids. Links to the timing metrology infrastructure may be included, where relevant.
Proposals should exploit EGNSS differentiators such as Galileo Open Service multi-frequency, Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS), Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OS-NMA), Galileo Signal Authentication Service and Galileo Search and Rescue Service (SAR) for the development of new innovative applications.
Developed applications should have a clearly defined commercial potential and should respond to user needs. The solution developed is expected to achieve TRL7-9 by the end of the project.
Proposals should deliver new innovative applications, with commercial
impact and a clear market uptake. Standardisation of new technologies is also in the scope of the topic and might be considered by the applicant. The use of other space components such as Copernicus is recommended. In particular, the use of Copernicus Emergency Management and Security services is highly encouraged. The developed solutions may integrate other non-space technologies like IoT, big data, artificial intelligence, drones, 5G, augmented/mixed reality etc.
For proposals under this topic:
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs and midcaps, is encouraged;
Participation of, or outreach to, entities based in countries without a space tradition is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate researchers (engineers, scientists, and others) is also encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships when applicable;
A Business Plan and evidence of user engagement is compulsory and must be provided as part of the proposal, to demonstrate the user need and sustainability of the project.
The involvement of public authorities in the safety critical domain may be foreseen, to attract public authorities as launching customer in case of successful projects.
Applicants are advised to exploit all possible synergies with other security specific actions funded under the work programme of Cluster 3 “Civil security for society” and funded under the work programme of Cluster 5 “Climate, Energy and Mobility” (e.g. Aviation safety topic “More resilient aircraft and survivability).
Proposals under this topic should exploit synergies and be complementary to national activities and activities funded by ESA.
Applicants are welcome to use the European space data infrastructures, e g. Galileo Service Centre, EGNOS Data Access Service (EDAS) and the EGNOS user support facilities (ASQF).

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Foster the adoption of EGNSS in mass markets and professional markets.
Create applications that will make the best use of EGNSS innovative features such as better multipath resistance, authentication etc.
Contribute to the competitiveness of the European GNSS industry in the area of mobile applications, with special focus on the innovative role of SMEs and midcaps, and non-space countries.
maximise public benefits by supporting the development of EGNSS applications that will address major societal challenges in focus areas such as health, citizen safety and security, mobility and the sharing economy.
Scope:
Proposals may be submitted in any of the following areas:
Internet of Things: Within Internet of Things solutions, there is a clear trade-off in terms of accuracy and battery life that prevents users to rely on GNSS in any situation. EGNSS solutions should demonstrate how power reduction techniques can effectively deliver GNSS-level accuracy in IoT devices and develop IoT solutions able to demonstrate the EGNSS compositeness in the IoT domain, to be used in application fields such as food geo traceability, blockchain and Artificial Intelligence
Mobile solutions. Development of new EGNSS enabled solutions which exploit the EGNSS differentiators such as High Accuracy Service and authentication features or which leverage the availability of GNSS raw measurements in smartphones.
mHealth-solutions for ‘silver economy’, robotics. With the ageing population growing fast in the EU, governments will be increasingly challenged to meet the needs of older people in a cost-effective manner. EGNSS can support the ‘silver economy’ by satisfying the specific needs of elderly and disabled persons. The innovations brought by EGNSS, together with technologies such as robotics or enhanced home automation – should be exploited to develop innovative solutions.
Artificial intelligence- Big Data, geo-tagging, optimisation for multiple sensors. Advances in AI will improve the capabilities of applications and services, providing improved experiences to all users.AI-enabled machine learning can be used to improve the GNSS data processing to provide greater performance thanks to the optimisation of multiple sensors. Proposals should explore synergies between EGNSS and Artificial Intelligence, in the frame of applications relaying on big data and geo-tagging techniques. Synergies with earth observation data can be also exploited.
Cybersecurity- solutions that are stimulating privacy, security of location data, exploiting synergies with quantum. In a digitalised world, privacy and cybersecurity are of utmost importance for individuals who are increasingly relying on digital applications to perform day-to-day task and activities. EGNSS solutions should enhance the security of location-based applications. Additionally, synergies with quantum can be leveraged as well.
Sharing economy- solutions for logistics, mobility services, goods and food. The sharing economy covers many different sectors. It is rapidly emerging across Europe. Within this trend, GNSS is a key technology for all services requiring geographic information. Newly developed EGNSS solutions in the field of logistics, mobility services, and food industry should capitalise on the enhanced accuracy and the innovative features provided by EGNSS.
Sports and fitness - smart wearables. Wearables represent the beginning of the separation between smartphones and end users, as an increasing number of smartphone services and apps are now accessible via new interfaces (smartwatches, fitness trackers, smart glasses, clothing, etc.). Currently, wearables are mostly used for fitness, health and entertainment. Proposals should ensure the use of EGNSS innovative features and differentiators in the smart wearables domain, integrating also other non-space technologies.
Synergies with other space components and other non-space technologies are applicable to this topic.
The developed applications should have a clearly defined commercial potential and should respond to user needs. Standardisation of new technologies is also in the scope of the topic and might be considered by the applicant. The solution developed is expected to achieve TRL7-9 by the end of the project.

Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For staff members
Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects within and outside academia;
More knowledge and innovative ideas converted into products, processes and services;
More entrepreneurial mind-sets, testing new and innovative ideas;
Increased international exposure leading to extended networks and opportunities;
Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact.
For participating organisations
Innovative ways of cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines;
Strengthened and broader international, interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral collaborative networks;
Boosted R&I capacity.
Scope:
MSCA Staff Exchanges involve organisations from the academic and non-academic sectors (including SMEs) from across the globe.
Support is provided for international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility of R&I staff leading to knowledge transfer between participating organisations.
Mobility through secondments
The organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a joint R&I project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. Such a project must explore activities that can be based on previous work but should go beyond and generate or strengthen long-term collaborations. Secondments must always take place between legal entities independent from each other.
MSCA Staff Exchanges can address three dimensions of mobility: inter-sectoral, international and interdisciplinary[1]. While exchanges between organisations within EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries should mainly be inter-sectoral, same-sector exchanges[2] are also possible under the condition that they are interdisciplinary. Interdisciplinarity is not required for same-sector exchanges with non-associated Third Countries.
Secondments between institutions established in non-associated Third Countries or within the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country are not eligible.
The collaborative approach of MSCA Staff Exchanges should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations and create synergies between them. The secondments should be essential to achieve the joint project’s R&I activities. The project should inter alia enable networking activities and the organisation of workshops and conferences, to facilitate sharing of knowledge and testing of innovative approaches for specific R&I topics.
Skills’ development
For participating staff members, the project should offer new skills acquisition and career development perspectives. Participating organisations must ensure that the seconded staff are adequately mentored.
[1]Interdisciplinarity means the integration of information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts or theories from two or more scientific disciplines. These aspects will be assessed during the evaluation.

","HORIZON Coordination and Support Actions
","29 June 2021
","15 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Progress towards more and better links between research and innovation actors across European Research Area and beyond is a requirement if Europe as a whole is to capitalise on excellence from across the continent. To foster brain circulation for researchers and innovators the intervention point of the ERA Chairs actions is attracting in a sustainable manner outstanding scientists and innovators to universities or research organisations in catching up countries and regions. This measure of “brain gain” and creation of pockets of excellence will impact on the culture and performance of host institutions.
The leadership of the ERA Chair holder and the creation of a permanent and excellent research group in the chosen scientific field will ensure excellence, visibility and better integration in the European Research Area, as well as fostering competitiveness in research funding and promoting institutional reforms aligned with ERA priorities.
Projects are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes:
At system level:
Increase in number of R&I talents moving to host organisations in Widening countries
Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers and innovators
Encouraging institutional reforms in research institutions and in the national R&I system in widening countries
Strengthening of Widening countries’ human capital base in R&I with more entrepreneurial and better trained researchers and innovators
Better communication of R&I results to society
Better quality and capacity of research and innovation contributing to Europe's competitiveness and growth
Improved excellence capacity and resources in Widening countries and close the still apparent research and innovation gap within Europe
At organisation level:
Research excellence of the institution in the specific fields covered by the ERA Chair holder.
Increased attractiveness of the institution for internationally excellent and mobile researchers.
Creation of a permanent and excellent research group in the chosen scientific field with a spill-over effect on the institution;
Improved capability to succeed in competitive research funding in the EU and globally, at least, in the fields of choice;
Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society
Scope:
Research organisations located in widening countries interested in establishing an ERA Chair shall submit a proposal with the prospective ERA Chair holder who should be an outstanding researcher and/or innovator in the chosen scientific domain. The scientific field can be any domain of research and innovation addressed under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union[1].
The institution in the Widening country shall be the coordinator and can opt between a joint application with the legal entity currently employing the future ERA Chair or submitting a proposal as a single applicant. For the former, partner institutions can be located in any country (including countries outside the EU) except the country of the coordinator and ERA Chair holders can be citizens of any country in the world.
Proposals should include a CV in Europass form[2] of the future ERA Chair holder and detail the scientific and technical support he/she will provide to the coordinator and how the proposed activities will upgrade from the current situation. If there is a partner institution proposals should outline any additional support to be provided by it to the coordinator. Proposals should also describe any relevant investments of the coordinator in research projects, facilities and infrastructures and how those will be achieved and/or a better use of the installed research capacity (in particular of EU co-funded research infrastructures & facilities). Existing or foreseen arrangements for compliance with ERA priorities [3] including the European Charter for Researchers & Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers[4] are to be outlined in the proposal.
ERA Chair holders should be excellent researchers and/or innovators in the chosen field of research[5]. They should establish a research team fully integrated in the coordinator's institution to significantly improve its research performance in the scientific domain of choice and to be more successful in obtaining competitive funding. The selection of personnel to the research team is to be conducted by an international recruitment panel leaded by the ERA Chair and outlined in proposals. The ERA Chair holder should also have a position within the organisation/university, allowing her/him to make appropriate resource allocation decisions, supervise team members and freely apply for research funding. When this is compatible with the nature of the coordinator, he/she is expected to take on some teaching duties.
To allow for the determination of the commitment of the future ERA Chair holder and of the coordinator institution, proposals shall include: 1) a letter signed by the prospective ERA Chair holder expressing his/her commitment to the proposal and willingness to take on the underlying tasks and obligations; 2) a letter from the head of the coordinator institution committing to the proposal and stating that the ERA Chair holder is to receive adequate support to take on her/his tasks and duties including, for example, access to research facilities, supervision of researchers, teaching duties (if any) and capacity to apply freely to national and international funding.
The ERA Chair holders might move on a temporary or permanent basis to the coordinator’s premises. To this end, secondments or any other legal arrangements (e.g., leave without pay, sabbatical licences) are possible including part-time work and multiple stays. All contractual arrangements and the timeline of ERA Chairs stays at the coordinator should be indicated in the proposal as well as the salary, travel and daily allowances and/or other perks to be offered. If, at any stage, the preferred option is an employment contract, the future contractual arrangements with the coordinator should be detailed.
To ensure the sustainability of the action, the ERA Chair research team should have conditions to thrive after the end of the Horizon Europe funding. This should be clearly demonstrated in the proposal and include the appointment of the leader of the newly created research group on a permanent basis within the coordinator organisation (to which the ERA Chair holder might apply) during the initial 3 years of the duration of the grant. This is to be conducted through an open recruitment procedure to be monitored by the European Commission.
Grants have an expected duration of up to 5 years and cover expenses related to the ERA Chair holder and a number of team members (e.g. their salaries, recruitment costs[6], administrative costs, travel and subsistence costs) and research costs up to 10% of the EU contribution. Costs to be claimed by a partner institution should be mainly linked to personnel seconded to the coordinator. The grant should also provide a contribution towards measures aimed at facilitating structural changes in the institution (e.g. costs for trainings, meetings, publications and managing Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisations’ commitments through their adopted gender equality plans, and in line with ERA objectives, as far as appropriate.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced quality and enhanced efficiency of the current services to respond respectively to policy and/or user requirements and to technological developments
Significant improvement in resolution, detection capabilities, timely access to data and delivery of information according to the requirements of emergency and security applications
Significant improvement in integration of non-space data along end-user intelligence supply chains, bringing added value at operational level (e.g. local and regional monitoring networks or field campaigns)
Development of processing chain(s) to handle an increasing volume of satellite data, keeping underlying technology up-to-date and include new paradigms in data fusion, processing and automation to match users increasing expectations in added-value, easiness of access and visualisation.
Scope:
The R&I, which needs to be addressed to tackle the above expected outcomes will investigate new and innovative methods and technologies to enhance the current services performance. Specifically timeliness access to data, the need to reduce the gap between user needs and service provision, new paradigms in data fusion, automation and inclusion of wider sets of complementary, non-EO data to demonstrate the viability of extending services to a broader range of users (relevant authorities from European to local levels) and to better monitor security and emergency threats at regional or local level.
Upstream in the space segment, emerging EO missions in the coming decade will provide new types of space data (being new Sentinels or other contributing missions), which also require new algorithms and processing chains to be developed. Both the development of advanced processing and modelling techniques will be targeted and the exploitation of new sources of data, to create new products or significantly improve the quality and performances of existing elements-components for the benefit of users.
On data fusion, vast amounts of EO-data are now being available for applications in the security and disaster domains. Identification of complementary data sets, development and testing of new and innovative ways (if applicable also in the context of social innovation) to efficiently integrate them in emergency and security applications will be used to generate added-value and new intelligence. Non-EO data could include in-situ observations and measurements, meteorological data, data from aerial platforms, social media or crowd-sourcing, as well as information generated from other sources and other Copernicus services. Whenever appropriate, the project should take advantage from Copernicus and EGNSS synergy.
Proposers are advised to exploit all possible synergies with other security specific actions funded under the work programme of Cluster 3 “Civil security for society”.
Proposals are expected to provide tangible results (new or improved products or service elements) for the Copernicus service within the period 2021-2027. The proposed research and development should be modular and scalable. The activities of the project should also contribute to the objectives set by the Group on Earth Observation and outcomes and relevant results of the project should be promoted also at international level through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In addition, the project could contribute to the objectives set by the DestinE initiative.
The project should provide a proof-of-concept (e.g. system element targeting TRL 5-6) at least demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service.
Additionally, the transfer of research results to possible operations should receive active attention during the course of the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entity of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Software should be open licensed.
Applicants are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general at https://www.copernicus.eu/en and further details on the topic in the Guidance document[1]
.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

Competitiveness and innovation of the EU space sector depends on the availability of high educational standards and skilled professionals across a range of qualifications and the possibility for these professionals to upgrade and update their skills. This is also in the interest of the research and innovation community where the quality of the results and the impact of EU-funded research is a precursor of the future space sector. The EU also plays a role in the aligning of educational degrees to provide more opportunities and promote mobility of professionals and researchers across countries and sectors.
The scope of this action encompasses:
The analysis of the main curricula and courses available and existing educational standards across the EU-27 at bachelor, master and post-graduate levels as well as continuing education (training and staff qualification / certification). The study should provide an overview of the ‘supply’ of space-oriented education and of the ‘demand’, a quantitative analysis of the ‘stocks & flows’ of students at the different levels eventually employed in the space sector at large (academia, government agencies, upstream industry, downstream industry) including socio-economic aspects (e.g. gender, educational background, family income, parents’ education, residence geography, etc.), and a comparative analysis of the cost/time to achieve a degree. This should be supported by extensive, in-depth quantitative and fact-based evidence and encompass EU-27 and Associated Countries.
The analysis of the skills required and reskilling needs of the R&I and the industrial community (across the entire supply chain, ranging from upstream space to downstream space) will be performed and structured, presumably along existing educational modules (e.g. electrical, mechanical, telecommunication, system engineering, physics, psychology, medicine). The analysis should engage both industry and educational institutions. It should not be limited to technical, scientific, engineering disciplines but also includes the essential soft skills needed, such as the ability to work in a diverse multidisciplinary team, to communicate efficiently, to create new activities and businesses, etc. An assessment of the number of professionals needed in the different sectors will be produced, based on fact-based and in-depth quantitative analysis of the demographics across EU-27, the current/projected enrolment rate into space-oriented disciplines, the success rate, etc. This will also include an exploratory look at future skills, which the space sector will need in the future. The analysis should take into consideration results stemming from existing activities funded under Horizon 2020, e.g. the EO4GEO project (http://www.eo4geo.eu) and the PERSEUS project https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/640211
The analysis of the match between needs and offer across the whole of EU-27 will be analysed and recommendations made to ensure a better match between the needs and the offer in the coming years. For this, a benchmarking of the career opportunities for space-oriented graduates coming from different universities across the EU-27 and Associated Countries (e.g. time to first employment, average salary after 3-5-7 years, etc.) will be performed. An assessment of the net inflows/outflows within EU-27 and Associated Countries and with non-EU countries will be carried out.
In particular, the co-operation between academia and industry in the field of PhD studies will be assessed and measures to promote the research experience of the academic personnel proposed.
The use of continuous learning “in-company” and “out-of-company” supported by the new digital technologies with guaranteed quality e.g. Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) will be assessed and promoted.
Promotion of the space sector jobs and careers (in particular where there is a strong demand for qualified workforce) and information about the different curricula and disciplines of interest for such careers in Bachelor and Master studies.
Creation of course modules in relation to the 2 EU flagship constellations Copernicus and Galileo for jobs related earth observation and PNT, in particular for the downstream sector.
Up to 1 project will be funded.

Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced quality and efficiency of the current service to respond respectively to policy and/or user requirements and to technological developments.
Development of efficient and reliable new products chains, calling for new paradigms in data fusion, data processing and data visualisation essential for the service to handle more high-volume satellite data sets and product sets. The baseline is to preserve continuity of what has been achieved while keeping the service modern and attractive.
Development of new algorithms and processing chains preparing for the use of the new types of space observation data (being from new Sentinels or other contributing missions) in order to allow development of new products or the improvement of existing products.
Scope:
Since 2013, CLMS has developed core products for the monitoring of natural resources and the assessment of land cover and land use changes, including land cover conditions. At European level, land cover mapping is carried out on a regular basis, every 6 years for CORINE and every 3 years for the thematic ‘High Resolution Layers” (HRL). The local component dealing with land cover mapping on specific areas like riparian areas, urban zones and Natura 2000 sites, is following the same approach with a 6 years cycle but at very high resolution. At Global level, an annual land cover mapping has been proposed since 2015 at mid resolution, the evolution to high resolution is also envisaged.
Vegetation, Inland Water and Cryosphere conditions are also monitored but on a regular basis, mainly ten-daily basis at mid-resolution for the Global and European levels.
These mapping and monitoring approaches were partly conditioned by the availability of satellite data. The deployment of the full Earth Observation capacities of Copernicus and the complementarities between the instruments, including outside Copernicus environment, allows to rethink of the approach including for providing a better answer to the policy needs.
The R&I has the main scope to develop new and innovative methods to combine and explore data with different spatial and temporal characteristics using automatic processing for land cover and land cover status change assessment. A more dynamic approach (e.g. annual overviews or early warning or alert systems) and the integration of various sensors will enhance the development of specific automatic processing approaches for real and near real time data processing to respond to emerging European policy needs.
With an integrated modelling approach, the integration of new observational data becomes a driver for further enhancement and improved realism of the already existing production chains, assimilation systems and coupled models. The development of advanced processing (also including AI and HPC) and modelling techniques, as well as the exploitation of new sources of data, will be targeted to create new products or significantly improve the quality and performances of existing elements-components for the benefit of users.
The project should take into account the existing service and clearly define to what extent the service will be improved with new elements or products, including the use of enhanced models, algorithms, tools and techniques to generate new product(s).
Proposals are expected to provide tangible results (new or improved products or service elements) for the Copernicus service within the period 2021-2027. The proposed research and development should be modular and scalable. The project should provide a proof-of-concept (e.g. system element targeting TRL5-6) at least demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service.

New and innovative methods to better use of auxiliary observations such as 14C (radiocarbon), SIF (Solar Induced Fluorescence), and APO (Atmospheric Potential Oxygen) to separate anthropogenic CO2 emissions from the natural variability of CO2
To enable the EU to move towards a low-carbon economy and implement its commitments under the Paris Agreement, a binding target to cut emissions in the EU by at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 was set and the European Commission President von der Leyen committed to deepen this target to at least 55% reduction by 2030. This was further consolidated with the release of the Commission's European Green Deal on the 11th of December 2019, setting the targets for the European environment, economy and society to reach zero net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050, outlining all needed technological and societal transformations that are aiming at combining prosperity and sustainability.
The main objective is to perform R&D activities identified as priorities for the Copernicus CO2MVS capacity as identified by the European Commission’s CO2 monitoring Task Force[1] .
The activities should support the further development of the foreseen European operational monitoring support capacity for fossil fuel CO2 emissions. These activities should complement or follow-up on the activities within the H2020-funded CO2 Human Emissions (CHE)[2] project and the Prototype system for a Copernicus CO2 service (CoCO2)[3] project.
The activities, as described in the Guidance document, should address a series of scientific and critical system design issues, which were defined following outcomes of the CHE project and based on recommendations from the CO2 monitoring Task Force.
More generally, this action should support the development of an integrated support capacity, enabling European experts to collectively share their knowledge and join forces on the multiple fronts required to develop such a system with operational capabilities.
The activities should fulfil the technological and scientific requirements for the development of this European operational capacity, to further improve the prototype system to better meet user requirements and to exploit synergies with other Copernicus services.
Proposals are expected to provide tangible results (new or improved products or service elements) for the Copernicus service within the period 2021-2027. The proposed research and development should be modular and scalable. The project should provide a proof-of-concept (e.g. system element targeting TRL 5-6) at least demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service. The activities of the project should also contribute to the objectives set by the Group on Earth Observation and outcomes and relevant results of the project should be promoted also at international level through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In addition, the project could potentially contribute to the objectives set by the DestinE initiative.
Additionally, the transfer of research results to possible operations should receive active attention during the course of the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entity of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Software should be open licensed.
Applicants are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general at https://www.copernicus.eu/en and further details on the topic in the Guidance document[4]

","16 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Commonly occurring space weather events (SWE) have the potential to affect the performance of critical space and ground infrastructure by disrupting operations and communications in multiple sectors of society. In addition, “extreme SWE” could have devastating societal and economic consequences with potential costs for disruptions and damages estimated in tens or even hundreds of billions of Euros.
Space weather technological research for new precursor services: the worldwide goal of space weather activities should be to monitor and forecast SWE just like terrestrial weather. However, direct physical simulation is currently not achievable for an operational Sun to Earth system, due in part to the lack of measurements and to the complexity of the involved processes, as well as different timescales involved. Current space weather models are generally not capable of forecasting events over several days. A longer forecasting horizon would require access to data from new observation infrastructure coupled with new and improved modelling capabilities. Research and innovation activities should address application domains that may include space as well as terrestrial infrastructure. Proposals should include architectural concepts of possible European space weather services in relation to the application domains addressed and they should demonstrate complementarity to Space Weather services developed through the Space Situational Awareness component of the EU Space Programme.
Prepare Europe for a full exploitation of space weather data by a renewed effort on modelling and forecasting using currently available data.
Develop concepts to provide space weather data, forecasts and warnings with criteria on (timely) availability, harmonized (data) standards and quality control similar to the best-practices of meteorological services (as e.g. documented by the World Meteorological Organisation WMO).
Improve scientific understanding of the origin and evolution of space weather phenomena.
Improving SWE restitution and prediction capabilities using artificial intelligence / deep learning techniques.
Develop new services for both scientific purposes and terrestrial infrastructure monitoring.
Acceleration innovation of enabling technologies (maturing, prototyping, on ground tests including exploratory ground based instrumentations research)
Identified and matured concepts up to TRL 3-4
Scope:
New modelling including ab-initio simulations to understand fundamental Sun-Earth physical mechanisms and their sensitivity to parameter change for improved forecasting skills, and forecasting techniques capable of improving the restitution quality and extending the time horizon of a future space weather forecasting capability to several days.
Proposals should address the development of modelling capabilities and/or the delivery of prototype services able to interpret a broad range of observations of the Sun’s corona and magnetic field, of the Sun-Earth interplanetary space and of the Earth magneto/iono/thermo-sphere coupling relying on existing observation capacities.
Validate and harmonize the currently available data from existing services and identify gaps in data and model availability.
Training of models using deep-learning techniques based on existing large aggregated databases from space measurements.
Inventory of potential early indicators of extreme space weather events.
Complementary and coherent activities with the ESA on-going or future activities in particular those decided at the last ESA Ministerial held in November 2019.

","03 November 2021
","15 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Excellence hubs are an initiative to strengthen regional innovation excellence in placed based innovation ecosystems by cross-border collaboration on a common strategy and/or alongside value adding chains. Place based innovation ecosystems are interconnected companies, research institutions, governmental bodies and societal actors that are mutually reinforcing each other in a territorial context and together raise the level of innovation excellence in their regional fabric.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Excellent and sustainable place based innovation ecosystems in Widening countries and beyond in relevant domains of cutting-edge science and innovation
Long term joint R&I strategies underpinned by concrete action plans of European relevance
Common investment plans for R&I including infrastructures leveraging national, regional and European funds as well as private capital in a synergetic manner
R&I pilot projects alongside a joint strategy and in line with regional and national strategies, notably regional innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3)
New competencies and skills for researchers, entrepreneurs and professionals in R&I intensive domains
Strengthened linkages between science and business
Poles of attraction for talents in catching up regions and countries
Improved knowledge transfer and development of entrepreneurial skills.
Uptake of innovative technologies
New business opportunities especially for SMEs and new employment.
Scope:
Excellence hubs are part of the European excellence initiative and complement the science oriented schemes Teaming, Twinning, ERA Chairs and the European excellence initiative for universities by a dedicated innovation component. Excellence hubs will focus on innovation by allowing innovation ecosystems in widening countries and beyond, to team up and create better linkages between academia, business, government and society. This will foster a real placed based innovation culture in widening countries based on a strategic agenda aligned with regional or national smart specialisation strategies. In this context, synergies will be sought with the programme parts on European Innovation Ecosystems and the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT).
This action is embedded into the broader European initiative on ERA hubs and will help to bridge the innovation divide in this context. It responds to the third priority in the ERA communication on translating R&I results into the economy and will especially support R&I policies aiming at boosting the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies. This means ensuring Europe’s competitive leadership in the global race for technology based on excellence while improving the environment for business R&I investment, deployment of new technologies and enhancing the take up and visibility of research results in the economy and society as a whole. This action addresses regions as R&I actors since they are the place where the innovation and industrial ecosystems breath and develop, making the links between Europe and industry/SMEs, research centres, innovation stakeholders as well as citizens. Regionally developed innovation ecosystems connected across Europe will be the driver of new European strategic value chain.
Unlike Teaming projects that are centred around a single beneficiary Excellence hubs are networks of place based innovation ecosystems in widening countries involving larger communities of actors in a regional context based on the quadruple helix principle (see below). Individual participants and ecosystems from other EU member states, associated countries and international co-operation partners may join in duly justified cases e.g. given by a specific expertise needed or the involvement in a relevant value adding chain.
Projects should be established around the following core components:
Cross-border joint R&I strategy aligned with regional smart specialisation strategies and/or European policy priorities such as the green and digital transition
R&I project consolidating academia business linkages and providing evidence for strategy building and investment
Action and investment plans for implementation of the strategy
Conceptual design and pre-planning for pilots and demonstrators (if applicable) in line with the strategy
Accompanying measures e.g. to raise visibility, citizen engagement, technology transfer, entrepreneurship training, staff exchange, mutual learning etc.
Excellence hubs should improve access to excellence for R&I actors in widening countries and elaborate joint R&I strategies that are aligned with national, regional (notably RIS3) and/or European strategies or policy priorities (e.g. Green Deal, Digital transition). These strategies will be underpinned by concrete actions plans and an investment strategy that reaches out beyond the project’s lifetime and will leverage national, regional and European funds as well as private (venture) capital. Investment plans may include pertinent R&I infrastructures as well as demonstrators and pilots.
The research component should be developed by joint pilot research projects in a domain covered by the joint strategy that will facilitate long term cross border and inter-sectoral collaborative links between partners notably academia and business and advancement in science and technology development with market potential. In a particular R&I projects should serve the purpose to close knowledge gaps and develop evidence to underpin the development of the strategy and the investment plans. For example, in the R&I projects lab prototypes might be developed leading to the design of pilot plants or demonstrators (see above). However, the realisation of such pilots and demonstrators must be financed by other sources in particular programmes co-financed by the ERDF. The approach how to access such co-funding at a later stage should be sketched out in the proposal. Notably for the case of ERDF the proposal should demonstrate the alignment with the pertinent regional smart specialisation.
Accompanying measures are complementary activities that may promote knowledge and technology transfer, mutual learning and skills development especially in research and innovation management and entrepreneurship as well as citizen engagement. Mutual secondments and staff exchange within and between ecosystems will help to build trust and long term collaborative links.
Proposals should outline the nexus of collaborative links and if applicable competitive relations of commercial actors within each of the ecosystems in a conceptual model. Ecosystems or individual partners from outside the widening countries may participate in the consortium as long as they prove added value by facilitating access to excellence for the widening countries. Proposals should convincingly demonstrate the relevance of the chosen scientific domain by its alignment with regional (in particular RIS3), national and/or European R&I strategies and policy priorities. Applicants may choose between a more regional orientation e.g. proven by a common denominator in their regional smart specialisation strategy and/or a more global orientation towards European policy priorities such as the green or digital transition.
The description of R&I content based on this choice should include a long-term vision beyond the state of the art of the chosen R&I domain. On top of that, proposal need to demonstrate the win-win effects of the partnership established by the consortium and the benefits for employment and post crisis recovery. For the implementation, proposals should present a coherent package of actions well proportioned in terms of strategy development, research, innovation and outreach activities.
Excellence hubs as a new action under the widening component are complementary but different to initiatives such as Digital hubs or the EIT regional innovation scheme (RIS) because of their strategic orientation, broader scope and alignment with widening eligibility criteria.
The expected duration of the project is up to 4 years."

","HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions
","28 October 2021
","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the EU biodiversity and climate change objectives, successful proposals will support the protection and sustainable use of forest genetic resources by contributing to a better insight into the characteristics of genetic resources in the climate change context, adaptive and biodiversity supporting practices in forestry and the enhancement of Europe’s ambition in the international biodiversity agenda and international conventions.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved cooperation and knowledge sharing on deploying and conserving forest genetic resources in Europe;
Better conservation of unique tree lineages for forest ecosystem restoration and management;
Sustainable use of genetic resources within the forest community in a climate change context;
Efficient implementation of the Access and Benefit Sharing Regulation in the EU.
Scope:
Diversity of forest genetic resources provides the adaptive potential for tree species and populations to cope with climatic changes and future challenges. The adaptive potential of forests depends on their demographic history and the forces of natural selection. It also depends on forestry activities and the choice of species and populations that show better potential for adaptation to climate change or to subsequent effects of climate change. Provenance trials and common garden trials allow for the assessment of phenotypic responses in various environmental conditions and genomic backgrounds and therefore, genotype X environment interactions. New provenance trials in new environments including populations from range and habitat margins, coupled with genomic analysis of the provenances should provide insights to improve adaptive forest management.
Proposals should:
Conduct research and networking on provenance trials or common gardens, with new trials and reassessment of older provenance tests using phenotypic traits related to climate change adaptation. This analysis should guide adaptive forest management to choose appropriate forest reproductive material, including its use through assisted migration. This may also lead to a requirement for research into adaptive silvicultural management of stands to support the efficient and sustainable deployment of forest genetic resources.
Evaluate the impact of forestry activities on forest genetic diversity, develop new cultural trajectories to protect and sustainably use forest genetic resources in naturally regenerated forests, and quantify the ecosystem services provided by forest genetic resources.
Focus on methods and strategies to breed forest reproductive material with a higher genetic diversity, to diversify tree species composition when establishing new forests and regenerating existing forests. Biomass properties, essential for wood-based products as well as properties related to resilience to climate change induced disturbances, need to be safeguarded or enhanced in the new reproductive material.
Develop methods and tools to expand the production capacity of nurseries and the diversity of forest reproductive material produced to anticipate and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events, stimulate the development of nurseries in regions where forest reproductive material with useful characteristics is available, establish an EU network of forest nurseries assisting each other with the provision of forest reproductive material, and ensure the traceability of the material from the nursery to the final planting site.
Expand the EU Forest Reproductive Material Information System (FOREMATIS) and link it with existing information systems to provide information on genetic conservation units with useful properties, to serve as a decision-support tool on where to best source and/or plant forest reproductive material. This would take into account current/future climatic conditions, and create an archive for future generations that should allow the tracking of exact planting site and performance of forest reproductive material.
Cover different climate/biogeographical regions in Europe.

","12 October 2021
","10 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposals should improve European high-resolution, fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-land Earth System Models, able to robustly simulate key climate processes, their variability and future trends for this and well into the next century in order to enhance the quality, robustness and versatility of climate projections on a range of temporal and spatial scales (global and regional) to (1) support policies implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement and (2) address the societal need to assess and respond to the adverse impacts of climate change.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved climate projections with sound uncertainty estimates under different scenarios on different temporal and spatial scales.
Improved understanding and modelling of tipping points in the climatic systems, such as the ice shields at both poles and ocean circulation.
Advances in attribution of climate change and its phenomena to anthropogenic forcers.
Support to the evaluation of mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction policies through improved linkages with Integrated Assessment Models.
Pave the way for the next cycle of the IPCC Assessment reports by a leading role in the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Programme (CMIP).
Sustain and enhance European cooperation and leadership in climate sciences.
Scope:
Projects should foster a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-ice Earth-system model approach that contributes to a better understanding and representation of the processes, including for that drive and influence climate change on global and regional scale. Arctic and Antarctic regions should be considered as key elements in global climate changes.
Projects should make efficient use of available and high quality observational data (e.g. space-based and not space based, including in-situ and paleoclimatic data) for the development of robust model validation, verification, and improve uncertainty estimation methodologies.
Where relevant, high-resolution model development and evaluation should be properly connected with major programmes in the domain of Earth Observation such as the Copernicus Programme, the ESA science satellite missions in Europe, as well as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) at global level.
They should also strive to reduce uncertainty of key parameters of climate and hydrological systems. Projects should advance methods for assessing and attributing model outputs and climate change impact on regional scales with the support of advanced digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence methodologies.
The advanced climate modelling activities should support the attribution of observed and projected climatic hazards to climate change or climate variability.
The activities should build on the experiences from and results of other European projects contributing to the development of a new generation of climate models[1].
Beneficiaries are encouraged to take advantage of the emerging ICT infrastructures (e.g. EuroHPC and other high performance computing, cloud-based facilities) that will be made available through the Destination Earth initiative under the Digital Europe Programme[2].
If adding value to the project outcomes, coordination with the Destination Earth initiative can be proposed to ensure the timely development of “climate replicas” building on the new state-of-the-art IT infrastructure, including access to European high performance computing resources and an operational platform to upload and integrate the models and data developed in the course of the projects. Connection to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) should be considered where relevant.
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles[3]. In particular, beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to publish results data in open access databases and/or as annexes to publications. In addition, full openness of any new modules, models or tools developed from scratch or substantially improved with the use of EU funding is expected.
International cooperation is encouraged.
Projects are expected to co-operate with other projects funded under this call, as well as other relevant projects under Destination 1 and Cluster 6, Destination 5.

The Plan must be established at the beginning of the recruitment and should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.
COFUND takes the form of:
A) Doctoral programmes
Doctoral programmes offer research training activities to allow doctoral candidates to develop and broaden their skills and competences. They will lead to the award of a doctoral degree in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The training activities should be based on the EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral Training.
Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship will be supported. They will include, inter alia, training on the use of collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, public engagement and citizen science.
On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Collaboration with a wider set of associated partners, including from the non-academic sector, will be positively taken into account during the evaluation. These organisations may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training modules in research or transferable skills.
Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS[3] website) must include the minimum gross salary (not including employer’s social contributions) offered to the researcher.
B) Postdoctoral Programmes
Postdoctoral Programmes fund individual advanced research training and career development fellowships for postdoctoral researchers. The programmes should offer training to develop key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, foster innovation and entrepreneurship and promote and (where appropriate) reward Open Science practices (open access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, public engagement and citizen science, etc.).
Postdoctoral Programmes should have regular selection rounds following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between researchers. The selections should be open, widely advertised internationally (including on the EURAXESS website), competitive, merit-based and with a transparent international peer review, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.

","DIGITAL Simple Grants
","17 November 2021
","22 February 2022","Objective:
The objective is to deploy and operate an EU online marketplace for cloud and edge services. The marketplace should be the single point of access for trusted services, notably cloud and edge services (see topics 2.1.1 and 2.1.2), building blocks deployed under the Common Services Platform (see topic 5.3.1.1) and more generally any software and data processing services developed under EU programmes such as the Digital Europe Programme, Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe. It should as well complement the AI-on-demand platform, in providing access to the necessary cloud services. By facilitating access to these services for crucial EU sectors, the catalogue of curated services, i.e. of services that comply with EU rules and requirements, will improve the EU’s open strategic autonomy. This will ensure that the digital transformation of the economy is undertaken on the basis of secure, fair, inclusive and resource-efficient infrastructures and services.
As a minimum, the EU online marketplace will provide a brokerage for the transaction and delivery of cloud infrastructures and services offered by entities from the public sector. Over time, it should become a critical resource for supplying cloud-to-edge services to the public sector, services of general interest and, where applicable, the private sector. As such, the call described in this section will be restricted according to the basis of article 12(6) of the Digital Europe Programme Regulation.
The marketplace itself should become self-sustainable financially and operationally by the end of this first grant. It should therefore be revenue-driven, wherever necessary. Its implementation, supervision of transparency and fair rules of operation and long-term sustainability should be guaranteed and governed by a broad range of relevant stakeholders (cloud service providers, cloud users, regulators, the public sector and civil society) who would for example, implement the principles included in the upcoming EU Cloud Rulebook. Ahead of the call, the Commission will consult relevant stakeholders in order to identify the appropriate governance.
Scope:
The chosen project shall:
Define clear rules for the open, fair and transparent functioning of the marketplace, including how these would be guaranteed in the long term through an appropriate governance structure;
Deploy the technical infrastructure of the marketplace platform, with strong customer focus, user-friendliness, and inclusion and equality principles;
Ensure that the marketplace is built over the cloud-to-edge middleware platform (see topic 2.1.1);
Operate the platform according to security, energy and resource efficiency, data protection, ethical standards and portability requirements;
Ensure the integration of state-of-the-art identity and access management services on the marketplace platform to support its operations;
Design a curation/vetting process for services offered on the marketplace, notably for sector-specific services in regulated sectors (e.g. health, energy, finance…); these services should, inter alia, include the cloud-to-edge services (see topic 2.1.2) and middleware (see topic 2.1.1), the Artificial Intelligence tools (see section 2.3 3 and earlier EU funded projects), as well as building blocks deployed under the Common Services Platform (see topic 5.3.1.1).
Where other marketplaces exist, such as marketplaces already developed in some Member States or services platforms addressing specific areas (such as the AI-on-demand platform developed under 2.3), this marketplace will put in place the required mechanisms to offer a seamless and integrated end-user experience.
Adopt the appropriate governance to ensure the proper supervision of the marketplace by all relevant stakeholders, fostering interconnections with similar marketplaces and service catalogues that exist in some Member States;
Enable access on such platforms, through a single EU portal for cloud users, to an online catalogue of existing cloud-to-edge based service offerings (such as predictive analytics, data visualisation, edge services, Artificial Intelligence services and language technology services ...) that are compliant with a pre-defined set of EU rules and requirements (to be compiled in the EU Cloud Rulebook), notably those referred under 2.1.2;
Implement a service brokerage functionality to enable transactions between providers and users to take place on the marketplace;
Ensure a vendor-neutral technical architecture and reference framework;
Develop an agile and future-proof revenue model to cement long-term commercial viability of the EU online marketplace, while ensuring unbiased competition and strict vendor neutrality in the positioning of services on the marketplace; and, (If necessary), ensure the integration of trusted payment services on the marketplace platform to facilitate transactions;
Report regularly (at least once per month) to the Commission throughout the deployment phase of the project.
Where possible, open source software should be used for the development of the marketplace, notably to demonstrate transparency, vendor- independence and neutrality in the offering of services on the platform.
In order to foster common building blocks, the project supported under this action will liaise with those supported by the Data Spaces Support Centre in the areas of data spaces, pool data provision, demand for the cloud, the promotion of competitive and seamless access and use of cloud infrastructures and services in the context of the topics in section 2.2.
Expected Impact:
Outcomes and deliverables
Outcomes:
Strengthen the competitiveness and the innovation of the European economy and of common data spaces in the green digital age.
Cloud-to-edge services uptake among public entities and private sectors that lag behind in cloud adoption, such as the European health sector.
Deliverables:
The proper governance mechanism to supervise the marketplace by all relevant stakeholders, possibly through the setup of a legal entity.
A large-scale and user-friendly interoperable European marketplace for cloud-to-edge based services for public and private entities across the EU and common data spaces. Interconnections of the marketplace with existing national cloud marketplaces."

Outcomes and deliverables
At the end of the actions, a network of existing and newly established research hubs will be in place across the EU. Networks of expert and organisations linked to the hubs will be part of a European multidisciplinary community which will actively detect, analyse and expose disinformation campaigns in Europe. Each hub will have produced at least 10 investigations and reports on disinformation campaigns and shared them through EDMO. Hubs will have established at least 5 tailor-made media literacy programs in Member States and supported national authorities in producing reports (at least 1 per year) regarding the implementation and effectiveness of online platforms policies to tackle disinformation.
Objective:
Following-up from the first round of hubs created under CEF, this topic aims to create new national or multinational hubs for analysis of digital media ecosystems in order to expand the geographical coverage of EDMO. A national/multinational hub is a network of organisations active in one or several Member State(s), that will provide specific knowledge of local information environments so as to strengthen the detection and analysis of disinformation campaigns, improve public awareness, and design effective responses relevant for national audiences. The activities of the hubs should be independent from any public authority.
These national/multinational centres will focus their activities around emerging digital media vulnerabilities and disinformation campaigns, which are of special relevance within the territory and/or linguistic area in which they will operate. Multinational hubs will cover more than one Member State with similar media ecosystems within an EU region.
Scope:
Support will be provided to:
Increase the number of independent national or multinational hubs on digital media. Each hub must pull together a national/multinational multidisciplinary community composed of academic researchers, fact-checkers, media practitioners and other relevant stakeholders in order to create a network capable of quickly detecting and analysing disinformation campaigns, as well as producing content to support mainstream and local media and public authorities in exposing harmful disinformation campaigns. They will work in cooperation with EDMO and contribute to its repositories of fact-checks, media literacy materials and scientific articles, including surveys on disinformation trends, situational analyses and assessments of online platforms’ policies to address disinformation-related harms.
Detection, analysis and disclosure of harmful disinformation campaigns at regional, national, multinational and EU level, and analysis of their impact on society and democracy. They will analyse relevant actors, vectors, tools, methods, dissemination dynamics, and prioritised targets of disinformation campaigns by applying a common methodology, established in coordination with EDMO, to monitor the evolution of disinformation-related harms on relevant audiences. Each hub will indicate the type of collaborations intended with independent media outlets operating within its territory or linguistic area. The hubs will also monitor the financial viability of the news media sector within the territory or linguistic area covered, including the effectiveness of public support measures taken by Member States to address potential market failures affecting the plurality and diversity of the news media sector at national level. Funding will also support a regular assessment of the impact of relevant disinformation campaigns on society and democratic processes, as well as the effectiveness of the policies set out by online platforms to counter various disinformation phenomena. In addition, the hubs will actively participate to the EDMO joint research activities selected by the EDMO Governance Body and promptly react to EDMO requests linked to emerging disinformation issues.
Media literacy. The centres will identify the needs and support tailor-made media literacy campaigns for the covered territory or linguistic area. They will also leverage on the exchange of good practices and materials stored on the EDMO platform and contribute to the EDMO repositories with newly created educational and training materials.
Cooperation with national authorities for the monitoring of online platforms’ policies and digital media ecosystem in the territory or linguistic area covered by the proposal. In particular, they will support the competent national authorities, including the audio-visual regulator(s) overseeing, and monitor the implementation of the Code of Practice on Disinformation by its signatories. They will respond to the above-mentioned national authorities’ requests to carry out on-demand surveys on emerging online disinformation campaigns."

Outcomes and deliverables
The following elements shall be delivered by the selected project:
Deployment of an interoperable, FAIR-compliant and secure federated infrastructure and data governance needed to enable sustainable cross-border linkage of genomic data sets in compliance with the relevant legal, ethical, quality and interoperability requirements and agreed standards.
Platform enabling the application of appropriate high-end computing, AI and simulation resources to analyse the data.
Support for the establishment or upgrade of the necessary local infrastructure, and for the creation, extension and adaptation (e.g. FAIRification) of genomic datasets.
Business model including an uptake strategy explaining the motivation and incentives for all stakeholders at the different levels (national, European, global) to support the data infrastructure towards its sustainability, including data controllers (biobanks, hospitals/municipalities, research institutes, patients), data users (clinicians, researchers, policymakers, companies), service providers (e.g. IT industry, biotech industry), healthcare systems and public authorities at large.
Coordination support for the multi-country project ‘Genome of Europe’.
Comprehensive communication strategy.
Objective:
The objective is the creation of a technical infrastructure combined with governance mechanisms that will secure easy, cross-border access to key datasets in the targeted area. In particular, the aim of this topic is to achieve sustainable cross-border linkage of and access to a multitude of genomic and related phenotypic, clinical and other datasets across Europe based on the progress achieved in the context of the 1+ Million Genomes initiative (1+MG).[1] Authorised data users, such as clinicians, researchers and innovators, will be able to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments and predictive medicine, and for improved public health measures that will benefit citizens, healthcare systems and the overall economy. The resulting genomic data infrastructure will be aligned with the developments under the European health data space, including relevant projects supported under the EU4Health Programme. In order to maximise the societal benefits of health data use, the genomic data infrastructure should be supported by advanced IT tools and capacities, e.g. AI, HPC, cloud, blockchain and trust solutions, as appropriate for enabling secure access to and distributed analysis of complex datasets. Moreover, the measure will support the creation, extension and adaptation (e.g. FAIRification) of genomic datasets.
Scope:
This action will support the deployment of the infrastructure needed to make harmonised European genomic data resources and linked clinical, phenotypic and other information, where available and relevant, securely findable and accessible across national borders. The data infrastructure may combine existing data platforms via FAIR-compliant interfaces and should facilitate the extension or upgrade of existing datasets
and the creation of new ones. To ensure maximum data protection, the data will be in principle analysed using distributed data analysis and AI learning techniques, while fully taking into account the applicable data protection requirements and the EU’s international obligations.
The infrastructure is expected to provide a federated network of connected genomic databases deploying trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design), enabling data discovery, querying and use of appropriate computing capacities for distributed data analysis and providing a minimum of core services to facilitate the operation of the federated network. The federated system will comprise nodes with datasets, a common platform offering a (meta)-data catalogue, a single entry point for data queries and output delivery, links to high performance computing capacities and data access control, secure authorisation and authentication services, and access to other relevant services. Data transfer across national borders and/or central storage, if and when needed, may take place (only on a voluntary basis) in accordance with applicable EU and national legal requirements.
The system connecting harmonised data sources should provide at least the following functionalities: data discoverability, data reception/access, secure interfaces (APIs), data access management, and data processing (analysis). It should be based on FAIR principles, including common interoperability standards and mechanisms. Therefore, the implementation of the genomic data infrastructure should build on the progress achieved and agreements made within the 1+ Million Genomes initiative (and outcomes of the Horizon 2020 CSA project ‘Beyond 1 Million Genomes’). It should also take into account, link to and use the outcomes of other relevant H2020 projects, in particular exploring specific use cases/disease areas, and also collaborate and synergise with the related projects and partnerships supported under Horizon Europe.
The project shall, throughout its lifetime, inform and consult the representatives of Member States. It shall lead to defining a sustainable business model and setting up a coordination entity that will supervise the activities, run and maintain the system and its services, ensure the necessary agreements within the project and with Member States, and monitor the implementation of such agreements. The governance structures shall ensure that the rights and duties of both public and private participants are duly respected.
The action should support the coordination of the multi-country project ‘Genome of Europe’ launched in the context of the 1+MG initiative towards the creation of a European network of harmonised national genomic reference cohorts representative for the European population.
The project is expected to engage with patients, health professionals, the public and other stakeholders to explain that data is used transparently and responsibly, and raise awareness of the expected benefits for European patients and citizens. To this end, it should design and implement a comprehensive communication strategy covering the relevant stakeholders and communication channels.
The project selected for the deployment of this data infrastructure will have to make provisions for gradually becoming fully compliant with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework. It will also have to coordinate and collaborate with other projects participating in the deployment of the data space and the Data Spaces Support Centre in order to allow integration of existing standards and to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data.
Furthermore, the project implementing the genomic data infrastructure is encouraged to cooperate with Testing and Experimentation Facility for Health (see section 2.3.2.2), to define European test and training data sets and to provide support in their establishment.

The coordination and support action will provide:
An inventory of existing platforms collecting, storing and sharing data relevant for education and skills (public and private). A particular focus should be placed on the analysis of skills relevant for attaining the targets of the Digital Decade;
A proposed design approach based on scenarios with corresponding business models;
A multi-stakeholder governance scheme specific to the sector;
A blueprint for the data space including an architecture considering common building blocks;
Interim results in due time to inform the development of the implementation action to be supported under the next Work Programme;
Input to the work of the Data Spaces Support Centre.
Objective:
The objective is to deploy a secure and trusted data space to support sharing and accessing skills data for various purposes, from analytical and statistical purposes to policy development or re-use in innovative applications. The data space will provide easy, cross-border access to key datasets, deploying trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design) and develop data services matching European values, in particular of ethics, diversity and privacy.
The Digital Decade sets an ambitious target of 20 million digital technology specialists by 2030. Several important initiatives at the European level as well as national/regional level will contribute to this target, thus making important that data be shared across all initiatives.
Data is at the core of skills and education, offering enormous potential for innovative applications. Databases of job offers, lists of curricula and certifications, inventory of topics studied at all levels of education can help better defining human resource, training, business or educational policy strategies.
Schools, universities, learning organisations, businesses, students, HR organisations and employment agencies make daily use of data, from job and occupational profiles, vacancies and skills, to available trainings, degrees and graduate numbers. Many of the education and skills data are highly sensitive, involving personal information. They also have a huge potential to improve skills intelligence and HR planning, learning material and processes, through artificial intelligence, data analytics or advanced technologies.
The level of fragmentation at the European level is high, involving many private and public actors, from job search websites, online learning providers to school administrations, ministries, universities, etc.
Scope:
The project will explore conceptual approaches and possible options and for the future deployment of this data space. Provisions for transparent and ethical data access and use, development of governance and business models for the data space are to be developed considering, among others, the evolving regulatory environment, cross-data-space elements, interoperability, equality, privacy and security issues.
The action will engage the community of stakeholders involving organisations at EU/multi-country level, public administrations and/or governmental bodies, private and public actors (Including IT developers and end-users), education and training providers. In particular, the project will:
Undertake an inventory of existing platforms collecting, storing and sharing education and skills data, in particular related to the green and digital transformations;
Explore different possible design approaches for the data space (e.g. serving private data sharing and interests, that are also complemented by public data, serving private and public interests), and elaborate the advantages and disadvantages;
Propose design/conceptual approaches, for the set-up of the data space, for the possible categorization of skills and identify common essential elements and develop corresponding business models;
Explore what services and applications could be envisaged in the future;
Develop a multi-stakeholder governance scheme of the data space;
Get broad consensus on the approach, governance, and business models.
The action will have to work in partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre (see topic 2.2.2.1) in order to ensure alignment with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework and the rest of the ecosystem of data spaces in section 2.2.1 thereof. The joint work will target the definition of:
the data space reference architecture, building blocks and common toolboxes to be used;
the common standards, including semantic standards and interoperability protocols, both domain-specific and crosscutting;
the data governance models, business models and strategies for running data spaces."

Scope:
The project will define the requirements and mechanisms for the AI-on-demand platform in order to:
support the implementation of the Adopt AI programme which supports the procurement of AI systems for public administrations (Proposed in the White Paper on AI).
serve the needs of both public administrations as well as the user industry, in particular SMEs, addressing the major industrial sectors in Europe, with high potential for large scale deployment
best support the wide uptake of trustworthy AI “made in Europe”, in line with AI regulatory framework on AI (Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (COM(2021) 206 final)) for the benefit of the European economy, society and also addressing environmental challenges
Interconnect with the cloud for computing requirements and with the data spaces
Interconnect with the Testing and Experimentation Facilities, and the Digital Innovation Hubs
To this end, the funded activities will:
Collect and consolidate the requirements and needs, mobilising a wide community of relevant stakeholders such as representatives of public administrations, businesses (in particular SMEs and start-ups) and technical experts, in key sectors, including through the European Digital Innovation Hubs. The requirements should be prioritised on the basis of their related impact in terms of potential for large scale deployment, social, economic and environmental impacts.
Provide a mapping of existing AI tools, incl. AI solutions already procured by public administrations in Member States, and identify gaps and future needs. This work should build on the information provided by relevant analyses and projects (Such as AI4EU and analyses of the use of AI in public administration).
Define mechanisms to guarantee that the resources that would be made available and deployed on the AI platform under topic 2.3.1.2 are trustworthy and “made in Europe”. This should take into account requirements stemming from the (future) AI regulatory framework, including the voluntary self-regulatory schemes. The platform to be deployed under 2.3.1.2 should then develop a service for the implementation of such mechanism.
Propose and prepare an instrument for long-term sustainability of the platform; this may include the development of an underlying Foundation/association, a solid business and governance model.
Define, in collaboration with the relevant actions funded under the Specific Objective 2 of the Digital Europe Programme, technical mechanisms and governance to ensure seamless interaction between the AI-on-demand platform with the underlying necessary resources, such as the data spaces and the Cloud-to–edge and HPC resources developed in this programme.

Outcomes and deliverables
A sustainable data governance scheme for the smart communities’ data space as well as a blueprint that connects existing local data ecosystems and EU systems and enables public and private stakeholders to develop cross-sector, cross-community, data services, including AI-enabled data services.
A detailed roadmap towards a full-fledged pan-EU smart communities’ data space that will be interconnected with the Green Deal data space (see topic 2.2.1.1), and will include a set of technical specifications for interoperability with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework.
The data space for smart communities will be subject to article 12(6) for the reasons already provided in section 2.2. The data space will offer data related to several critical city infrastructures such as energy supply and consumption, water management, waste management, traffic information, etc. which could then be exposed to vulnerabilities and impact EU public order. In addition, such data may be used for further fine-tuning the functioning of such city critical infrastructures (such as smart grids, etc.) as well as the AI-based solutions using this data.
Objective:
Time is critical in addressing the challenges of the twin digital and green transition. Cities and communities are ready for effective innovation, hence the need for the creation of a data space for smart communities as an enabler of the Green Deal goals and Sustainable Development Goals.
Given the systemic nature of the Green transition challenge, the project will bring together existing local data ecosystems, and relevant stakeholders, public and private, to join efforts and identify common principles for sharing large pools of data at the EU level, ensuring wide geographical coverage as stipulated in the Digital Europe Programme Regulation Art 16(3)-(4). The action will contribute to the definition of the technical infrastructure for data sharing across relevant domains (in particular, traffic, electricity, pollution, urban infrastructure, extreme weather events, water and waste management, etc.) in order to create cross-domain innovation and move towards the Green transition in each local context.
Ultimately, the project outcomes will become a valuable base for real time testing and deployment of AI-based solutions including the deployment of the Testing and Experimentation Facilities for smart cities and communities (see topic 2.3.2.4), Destination Earth Digital Twins (see topic 5.1.1.2) and AI-based solutions for Smart Communities (see topic 2.2.1.2.3).

Scope:
The funding will enable the establishment of a data governance mechanism, with a detailed roadmap on how the data space for smart communities will connect local data ecosystems at the EU level that could be interconnected with the future Green Deal Data space (see also topic 2.2.1.1). The project will grow organically, building on different EU initiatives and data ecosystems, and strengthening the connection between repositories of data. The project will:
Develop a multi-stakeholder data governance scheme, bringing together local data ecosystem stakeholders, to jointly identify the data infrastructures to federate in order to enable a data space for smart communities at the EU level.

Bring an agreed set of priority datasets and data themes (public, private, including citizen-collected, etc.) including real-time data, into conformity with the new blueprint standards and principles.
The action will have to work in partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre (see topic 2.2.2.1) in order to ensure alignment with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework and the rest of the ecosystem of data spaces in section 2.2.1 thereof. The joint work will target the definition of:
the data space reference architecture, building blocks and common toolboxes to be used;
the common standards, including semantic standards and interoperability protocols, both domain-specific and crosscutting;
The data governance models, business models and strategies for running data spaces.
Furthermore, the project is encouraged to cooperate with the Testing and Experimentation Facilities for smart cities and communities (see topic 2.3.2.4), to define European test and training data sets and to provide support in their establishment. The action should also establish links to those Horizon Europe missions that work with communities and cities as key implementing partners (e.g. Mission on Climate Neutral and Smart Cities and Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change), which would provide significant opportunities to test, experiment and up-scale the input to and use of the data space with local partners."

The selected action will deliver:
A sustainable data governance scheme and the identification of a proper governance body, including, where relevant, European Digital Innovation Hubs and Testing and Experimentation facilities.
an inventory of existing data platforms for manufacturing and a blueprint for manufacturing-specific building blocks which could contribute to the long-term convergence of existing and new data-related initiatives in manufacturing by making use of the data space technical infrastructure.
A detailed roadmap towards pan-EU data spaces for manufacturing and migration paths for the convergence of broadly established industrial systems to manufacturing data spaces and the data space technical infrastructure.
The data space for manufacturing will be subject to article 12(6) for the reasons already provided in section 2.2. The data space will provide information on the entire manufacturing and distribution chain. Such data can reveal sensitive information about critical manufacturing sectors in the EU, such as aerospace or automotive. This data could also expose dependencies and potential vulnerabilities in the production and supply chain which could be used for malicious attacks impacting EU security of the production and supply chains and more broadly public order.
Objective:
The preparatory action will establish a multi-stakeholder data governance, an inventory of existing data platforms for manufacturing and a blueprint for manufacturing-specific building blocks which could contribute to the long-term convergence of existing and new data-related initiatives in manufacturing by making use of the data space technical infrastructure. The preparatory actions will support the deployment of these data spaces for manufacturing, and propose sustainable business models and incentives schemes to motivate participants to share data.
Scope:
The action contributes to the definition of the technical infrastructure for data sharing and re-use within the manufacturing sector and across relevant sectors. The action will bring together existing national, regional and local data ecosystems, and relevant stakeholders, to join efforts and identify common principles for sharing industrial data and re-using large pools of data at the EU level.
The funding will enable the establishment of a data governance mechanism, with a detailed roadmap on how embryonic data spaces for manufacturing should progressively accelerate into a pan-European manufacturing data space and reach out to a very large user base, in particular SMEs. The manufacturing data space will grow organically, building on different solutions, initiatives and data ecosystems across the EU. The project will lay down the foundations of the common European data spaces by:
Developing a multi-stakeholder data governance scheme, bringing together national, regional and local data ecosystem stakeholders, to jointly agree on the data interoperability requirements and interfaces, and data federation models. The scheme will also review options in an existing or new governance body to ensure openness, conformity and evolution of these, in agreement with the private sector.
Delivering sustainable business models for the data spaces, which incentivise data sharing and reuse of the private sector, such as data brokerage, data valuation, and service bundling and pricing.
Elaborating an inventory of existing data platforms for manufacturing and a blueprint for manufacturing-specific building blocks which could contribute to the long-term convergence of existing and new data-related initiatives in manufacturing by making use of the data space technical infrastructure. It will ensure that the data spaces for manufacturing are based on existing EU legislation and data policies, as well as on common principles agreed at sector or local levels as well as data sharing and reuse template contractual arrangements. The blueprint will clarify the building blocks and common elements necessary for the management of industrial data in data spaces for manufacturing (connectors, vocabularies…) from the value-added data applications delivered by competing suppliers. It will also propose migration paths for the convergence of broadly established industrial systems to manufacturing data spaces and the data space Technical Infrastructure.
Bringing an agreed set of priority datasets and data themes, including real-time data into conformity with the new blueprint standards and principles.

Outcomes and deliverables
A sustainable data governance scheme as well as a blueprint that connects existing national, regional and local data ecosystems and enables public and private stakeholders to access relevant data; and to develop cross-sector data services.
A priority list of datasets relevant to the European Green Deal Strategy;
A roadmap towards the common European Green Deal data space
Objective:
The Green Deal data space will interconnect[1] currently fragmented and dispersed data from various ecosystems[2], both for/from the private and public sectors. It will offer an interoperable, trusted IT environment, for data processing, and a set of rules of legislative, administrative and contractual nature that determine the rights of access to and processing of the data. The data space will also establish links with activities in other EU programmes such as Horizon Europe (in particular those funded under Cluster 4 “Digital, Industry and Space”, Cluster 5 “Climate, energy and Mobility”, Cluster 6 “Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment” and the relevant Missions) and the space programmes (e.g. Galileo and Copernicus) providing massive amounts of data including in real time. In order to coordinate among the various initiatives contributing to the Green Deal objectives, the project will propose a roadmap for the deployment of a full-fledged common European Green Deal data space and liaise with potential users and other relevant actors to ensure synergies between users and infrastructures..
The Green Deal data space will be set up in synergy with the various relevant initiatives implementing the Green Deal Goals. In particular, in the context of this Work Programme, synergies will target:
Relevant high quality data is expected to derive from the activities related to High Value Datasets[3] in the framework of the Public sector Open data for AI and Open Data Platform (see topic 2.2.2.2).
Data from other sectoral data spaces where relevant.
The topics implementing Destination Earth initiative (see section 5.1.1). It will also contribute through the development of a very high precision digital model of the Earth to enable visualising, monitoring and forecasting natural and human activity on the planet in support of sustainable development.
To complement the work during the first two years, a Coordination and Support Action on Digital Product Passport (see topic 5.1.3) will prepare the ground for a future common European data space for smart circular applications.
Scope:
The funding will enable the establishment of a data governance mechanism, with a detailed roadmap on how the data space should progressively develop into a pan-European Green Deal data space, by connecting EU programmes, national, regional and local data ecosystems at the EU level.
The roadmap should describe how to integrate the various activities contributing to the common European Green Deal data space in line with existing policy priorities and existing initiatives, enabling all relevant actors to access and re-use data needed for their purposes in compliance with the dataspace governance scheme. To this end, the roadmap should ensure that relevant users such as climate and environmental scientists are able to access and exploit the opportunities offered by Green Deal Data Space. Action to address potential barriers to such use cases should be identified in advance.
The action will have to work in partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre (see topic 2.2.2.1) in order to ensure alignment with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework and the rest of the ecosystem of data spaces in section 2.2.1 thereof. The joint work will target the definition of:

Outcomes and deliverables:
Wide availability of world-class experimentation facilities in Europe for edge AI microelectronic components based on advanced low-power computing technologies;
Service provisioning to a wide range of users: from semiconductor manufacturers and fabless companies, to end-user industries, SMEs and start-ups, requiring a varying degree of support in their further market development;
Fully tested and validated European IP and edge AI products based on European technology, ready for market deployment.
Objective:
The overall aim of the Testing and Experimentation Facility (TEF) for Edge AI hardware is to ensure the availability in Europe of trusted, high-performance, low-power edge components and technologies to support the massive data-processing requirements of AI and the digital transformation. The emergence of novel computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic, provides an opportunity for the European industry to take the lead in a new generation of edge and distributed computing systems.
The Edge AI TEF will also contribute to societal challenges, in terms of:
supporting the implementation of the Green Deal, by reducing energy consumption versus centralised computing solutions, also thanks to ground-breaking ultra-low power operation (100 to 1000 times more efficient) and very limited use of the data infrastructure (data transmission consumes even more energy than computing); further, edge AI components enable environmental monitoring as well as increased energy-efficiency of buildings and smart cities;
protection of personal data and privacy by processing within the edge device;
security and resilience avoiding or limiting dependency on the network;
safety and efficiency by reducing latency to near-real-time (e.g. for automotive or manufacturing applications).
European sovereignty in generation and management of sensitive data with trusted, secure components;
Open technological autonomy by reducing and diversifying strategic dependencies on components that may expose the EU to supply chain disruptions and security vulnerabilities, or not respecting European values in terms of safety, privacy, AI, equality, ethics or environmental aspects.
Scope:
This project aims at delivering a European platform that will enable companies to develop, test and experiment AI product prototypes based on advanced low-power computing technologies, custom-designed for their application environment. It involves the set-up of facilities for design, fabrication, integration and verification, employing leading-edge equipment with advanced semiconductor process and fabrication technologies. Such a platform will be able to bring novel embedded AI technologies to high Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), delivering prototypes for field validation that can significantly accelerate industrialization and time-to-market for edge AI components, resulting in a competitive advantage for the European ecosystem.
The TEF will realise a joint distributed platform (pilot line) to be led by EU centres of excellence in microelectronics technologies for advanced computing and key industrial actors of the microelectronics ecosystem such as integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) foundries and system integrators. The platform will be open to exploitation by EU industries, including SMEs, through direct support or through projects funded by other European or National programmes. In particular, strong cooperation is envisaged with the Joint Undertaking on Key Digital Technologies, which may support projects in close coordination with the TEF on Edge AI, as well as other EU partnerships in the area of AI, HPC, 5G/6G and cloud computing. Opportunities for future synergies with related actions on quantum computing infrastructure will also be evaluated.
Through the collaboration of a network of European Digital Innovation Hubs, the Edge AI TEF will provide also SMEs and Start-ups with fast and simple access to world-class testing facilities, rich networks of stakeholders and potential customers.
In cooperation with the sectorial TEFs in Manufacturing, Agri-food, Healthcare, Smart communities, the AI components delivered by the Edge AI TEF can be implemented in connected autonomous objects to be integrated in a distributed AI platform for applications such as industrial Internet of Things (IoT), precision agriculture, autonomous vehicles, implanted/wearable medical devices.
The selection of projects to be supported by the Edge AI TEF will be based on the character of innovation, on the business potential and on the strategic dimension for Europe.
The TEF infrastructure will put in place advanced semiconductor equipment that may also serve as a basis for quantum computing technologies, therefore opportunities for synergies with related Digital Europe actions on quantum computing infrastructure will be evaluated.
The first phase of the project will focus on the procurement, installation and preparation of the infrastructure, developing the necessary interfaces and testing of existing solutions, and the development of frameworks for hardware/software co-design and prototyping. In the following phases, the project will develop innovative prototypes employing the most advanced architectures and technologies beyond the state-of-the-art, incorporating energy efficiency, operational trust and security, which will be tested and validated in the respective field of application, before transfer for industrialization and production by IDMs or foundries.
The activities to be implemented based on this Work Programme are the following:
Procurement and preparation of the infrastructure - equipment installation, design tool finalisation, definition of devices with users, distribution;
Production of System Exploration Platform software for emulation of hardware;
Progress of key building blocks (such as sensing, in-memory computing, 3D architectures) to higher TRLs and validation of their design kits; development of design and prototyping frameworks;
Integration of building blocks into solutions, implementing rules and procedures for testing and transfer to industry.

Outcomes and deliverables
The coordination and support action will provide:
An inventory of existing platforms sharing data relevant for agriculture (public and private);
A proposed design approach based on scenarios with corresponding business models;
A multi-stakeholder governance scheme specific to the sector;
A blueprint for the data space including an architecture considering common building blocks;
Interim results in due time to inform the development of the implementation action to be supported under the next Work Programme;
Input to the work of the Data Spaces Support Centre.
Objective:
The main objective is to develop a secure and trusted data space to enable the agriculture sector to transparently share and access data allowing for an increase in its economic and environmental performance. The space may also serve common good purposes (for more information on the scope of the data space, please see “A European Strategy for Data”, COM/2020/66 final). The data space is expected to facilitate the sharing, processing and analysis of production data, open data and possibly other public data (e.g. soil data). Production data supplemented by publicly held data will present new opportunities for monitoring and optimising the use of natural resources and will contribute to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal (including the Farm-to-Fork-Strategy; Biodiversity Strategy 2030 and the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change) and the Common Agricultural Policy.
Scope:
The project will explore possible options and conceptual approaches for the future deployment of this data space. Provisions for transparent control of data access and use, development of governance and business models for the data space are to be developed considering, among others, the evolving regulatory environment, cross-data-space elements, and experiences with the EU Code of Conduct on sharing agriculture data by contractual agreement. The development of the data space is expected to have a strong end-user orientation and to consider potential users, including farmers currently less using data-based solutions.
The action will engage the community of stakeholders involving at least associations acting at EU/multi-country level representing relevant stakeholders, and public administration and/or governmental bodies. The community of stakeholders is to involve farmers, machinery suppliers, and possibly other agri-business branches and farms advisors, and representatives from the ICT industry. Ideally, representatives of all Member States are involved.
In particular, the project will:
Undertake an inventory of existing platforms sharing agricultural data,
Take stock of experience gained with the above-mentioned Code of Conduct,
Take stock of experiences gained with other types of data sharing as well as with data (set) generation in the private and public domains,
Explore different possible design approaches for the data space(e.g. serving private data sharing and interests, serving private data sharing interests complemented by public data, serving private and public interests), and elaborate the advantages and disadvantages,
Propose design/conceptual approaches, for the set-up of the data space, identify common essential elements and develop corresponding business models,
Develop a multi-stakeholder governance scheme of the data space,
Get broad consensus on the approach, governance, and business models.
Develop a roadmap for the step-wise deployment of data space, including the identification of public and private data sets which are expected to particularly contribute to the objectives of the data space
The action will have to work in partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre (see topic 2.2.2.1) in order to ensure alignment with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework and the rest of the ecosystem of data spaces in section 2.2.1 thereof. The joint work will target the definition of:
the data space reference architecture, building blocks and common toolboxes to be used;
the common standards, including semantic standards and interoperability protocols, both domain-specific and crosscutting;
The data governance models, business models and strategies for running data spaces.
Furthermore, the project is encouraged to cooperate with Testing and Experimentation Facility for Agri-food (see section 2.3.2.3), to define European test and training data sets and to provide support in their establishment."

Outcomes and deliverables
Inventory of existing platforms sharing data relevant for tourism
An analysis regarding gaps and overlaps of data, and identifying potential common building blocks with other data spaces created in the EU together with a priority list of data sets relevant for the tourism data space
A sustainable data sharing governance as well as a blue print that interconnects existing local data ecosystems and enables public and private stakeholders to develop tourism related data-driven services, including AI-enabled data services, on the basis of many types of data.
A detailed roadmap towards a sustainable data space for tourism, building on national initiatives and interconnecting with other data spaces
A set of technical specifications for interoperability with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework and other sectorial data spaces.
Objective:
Tourism is a major economic activity in the European Union with wide-ranging impact on economic growth, employment, and social development. It can be a powerful tool in fighting economic decline and unemployment. Nevertheless, the tourism sector, one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, needs support to face sectoral challenges exacerbated by the recent developments.
A tourism data space, through its connection to other sectoral data spaces (e.g. cultural heritage) will provide access to information to the ecosystem, with an impact on productivity, greening and sustainability, innovative business models and upskilling. It will give the possibility of align offer to tourists expectations, adapting service proposals to new tourists groups, predict a high influx of tourists, and thus plan resources more efficiently, and even creating new business opportunities
The preparatory action will establish a multi-stakeholder data governance, an inventory of existing data platforms for tourism and a blueprint for tourism-specific building blocks which could contribute to the long-term convergence of existing and new data-related initiatives in tourism by making use of the data space technical infrastructure. The preparatory actions will support the deployment of these data spaces for tourism, and propose sustainable business models and incentives schemes to motivate participants to share data.
Scope:
The funding will enable the establishment of a data sharing governance mechanism, with a detailed roadmap on how the data space for tourism will connect local data ecosystems at EU level that could be interconnected with other data spaces. The project will grow organically, building on different EU and national initiatives and public data ecosystems, and strengthening EU the connection between existing and future repositories of data. The project will:
Engage the community of stakeholders involving associations acting at EU/multi-country level representing relevant stakeholders, national entities involved in tourism and public administration and/or governmental bodies
Develop a multi-stakeholder data sharing governance scheme, bringing together local data ecosystem stakeholders, to jointly identify the data infrastructures to federate in order to enable a data space for tourism at EU level.
Elaborate a blueprint for the data space for tourism based on existing EU legislation and data policies, as well as on common principles agreed at sector or local levels. The blueprint should propose an appropriate conceptual architecture and when appropriate, refer to existing building blocks. Particularly relevant in this context are solutions such as eID (digital identity), eDelivery (secure data exchange), the Context Broker and the Big Data Test Infrastructure and others, already widely used by EU-wide cross-border systems, should be considered to facilitate interoperability among the actors. The blueprint should also comply with commonly agreed standards and principles and ensure interoperability. Particularly relevant in this context are the Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) Plus, work of SEMIC, the reference community for semantic interoperability, the INSPIRE and location interoperability data models, SAREF as well as the forthcoming interoperability framework for smart cities and communities (EIF4SCC).
Bring an agreed set of priority datasets and data themes (In addition to the relevant High Value Datasets), including real-time data into conformity with the new blueprint standards and principles.
The awarded consortium will work in liaison with the Data Spaces Support Centre (see 2.2.2.1) and the Alliance for Industrial Data, Cloud and Edge, to ensure alignment with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework with and the rest of the ecosystem in section 2.2.1 thereof, notably concerning common tools such as:
a data space reference architecture, building blocks, common toolboxes and cloud services;
common standards, including semantic standards and interoperability protocols, both domain-specific and crosscutting;
data governance models, business models and strategies for running data spaces, with the aim to recommend possible common tools, building on existing data ecosystems."

Outcomes and deliverables
Gains from Investment in key capacities can only materialise if there are enough people to design, deploy and use them. At present, all Member States face shortages of digital specialists and the training opportunities in digital areas are missing in the EU, compared to other countries. Specialised courses, such as Master’s courses in domains like Artificial Intelligence are not uniformly available in all Member States and concentrated in some regions.
The action will contribute to expand the education offer across Europe, by increasing the number of courses, jointly designed by universities from different Member States and associated countries together with excellence centres and businesses active in the domain. The impact will be twofold: an increase of courses offer all over the EU and the development of dynamic digital ecosystems where academic excellence, research and innovative industries work together to attract and retain the best talents worldwide.
Objective:
The action aims at increasing and improving the offer of education programmes and the number of students specialised in key capacity areas. The offer will be expanded in terms of geographical distribution (including outermost regions and other disadvantaged regions), number of opportunities and relevance to latest technological developments. The actions also aim at supporting more inter-disciplinary courses that can equip professionals with relevant advanced digital skills and increase diversity among students and future digital experts (for example data analytics skills for professionals in different sectors). The action will support cooperation between higher education institutions and the private sector, together with research and excellence centres in digital technologies, including those funded in the other actions of the programme. The goal is to encourage organisations to work together and develop ecosystems of excellence able to train, attract and retain the best digital talents, including by contributing to closing the gender gap in these fields (latest available data from ESTAT report that women represent only 18.5 % of ICT specialists in the EU). This action will contribute to the implementation of the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027.
Scope:
The chosen projects shall design and deliver a tertiary degree education programme of 60, 90 or 120 academic credits (The European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System - ECTS). The calls in the first two years will address the following topics: Data, Internet of Things (IoT), AI, Blockchain, cybersecurity, HPC, quantum, among others and interdisciplinary courses, including the teaching of the above areas in a non-ICT education field (e.g. AI applications for agriculture or cybersecurity and law etc..). Proposals can address only one technological areas, or more, or only one inter-disciplinary programme, with a specific focus on one sector. Tertiary education institutions in consortia with relevant competence and excellence centres and industry will receive funding to set up and strengthen excellent courses in the above areas. Partners in these consortia will be encouraged to share expertise, facilities, staff and learning material Inter-sectorial mobility between Higher Education Institutions and the private sector is also encouraged. These courses need to reflect the latest state of the art of the technologies, provide opportunities to students to have access to laboratories and testing and experimentation facilities and making use-where appropriate- of the EU data spaces. They will also make use of digital technologies to provide learning experiences that are flexible in time, scope end place, as appropriate. Activities to exchange on good practices to involve and interact with external stakeholders will also be encouraged. Particular attention shall be given to aspects such as green application and environmental impact of these technologies. The projects should also aim at increasing diversity among participants to the courses and ensure that experts will be trained to detect and prevent bias in the future developments.
The following activities can be eligible for funding, among others:
partnerships for higher education institution, research/excellence centres in digital technologies and innovative businesses. They will need to be sustainable over time and show a high degree of integration. Actors involved in the partnership will need to define a common education and training agenda that could result not only in an improved offer for students, with clear learning outcomes, but also increase their international attractiveness; adequate measures of quality assurance and quality monitoring, as well as activities leading to mutual learning and exchange of good practices, will be implemented;
upgrading technical equipment, to ensure that students have access to the latest technologies available in the market and improve facilities, as well as explore innovative ways to use technology in teaching and learning;
tackling the shortage of teaching staff and providing access to high quality teaching; incentives could be provided for professors, experts and top researchers in digital areas to contribute to the teaching activities;
providing support to students, via scholarships or fee waivers in order to allow everyone to have access to high-quality education in digital areas and to increase diversity in education and research.

","01 February 2022","Objective:
Based on the provisions of Article 7 and Annex Part IV of CEF Regulation, cross-border RES projects shall promote cross-border cooperation between Member States in the field of planning, development and the cost-effective exploitation of renewable energy sources, as well as facilitate their integration through energy storage facilities and with the aim of contributing to the Union’s long term decarbonisation strategy, completing the internal energy market and enhancing the security of supply.
The objective of preparatory studies as per Article 7(3) is to assist project promoters in selecting the best project concept and setting up the cooperation agreement, allowing for projects to be supported prior to having acquired the status as a cross-border project in the fielf of renewable energy.
Scope:
Preparatory studies in the meaning of Article 7(3) of CEF Regulation, allow for support to both EU Member States but also private project promoters in order to advance cooperation ideas, create momentum amongst involved stakeholders and with this generate a pipeline of cross-border renewable projects. It allows specifically support to the project before being included in the Union list of cross-border RES projects.
The purpose of support for preparatory studies is to overcome the obstacles that have in the past prevented cooperation projects from going ahead, such as uncertainty on the allocation of costs and benefits between involved Member States or the additional complexity of setting up cross-border support.
Applications related to preparatory studies must comply with the CEF Regulation and with the specific conditions set out in this call.
A study as per Article 7(3) can be designed as a pre-feasibility study. The funding can also be used to provide technical, economic or legal support in setting up or advancing cross-border cooperation with the objective to select the best project concept. As part of such a preparatory study, it is possible to cover also some wider system-related aspects, e.g. the integration of additional storage investments, or of transport and/or digital related investments for synergetic elements.
A study as per Article 7(3) can be used to start exploring (mainly through desktop studies) the possible sites in the territory of Member States (or third countries) in order to determine the hosting and participating countries, as well as other exploratory tasks needed to assess the overall cost and benefits of the project. It should allow identifying and formalising the underpinning cooperation mechanism and may include communication and stakeholder involvement activities.
The study may also investigate the best form of support, such as the auctioning and tendering set-up as well as all aspects for which national grid, market and other rules differ in the participating Member States and would need to be agreed upon.
To be noted that, further to the exceptions for applicants to demonstrate the financial capacity provided in section 7, the need to demonstrate financial capacity does not apply to transmission system operators certified following the procedures laid down in Articles 10 or 11 of Directive 2009/72/EC or Articles 10 or 11 of Directive 2009/73/EC and Joint Undertakings established in the EU which qualify as public bodies.
Expected Impact:
Cross-border RES projects are expected to contribute to a cost-effective achievement of renewables target by 2030 in the EU (as referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2018/2001/EC) and to the strategic uptake of renewables technologies and is an integral element of the enabling framework for regional and cross-border cooperation on renewables."

","28 October 2021
","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal’s zero pollution ambition, successful proposals will contribute to halt and prevent pollution of freshwater and soils, and consequently also protecting biodiversity, as addressed by several impacts under Destination ‘Clean environment and zero pollution’, in particular “Advanced understanding of diffuse and point sources of water pollution in a global and climate changing context, enabling novel solutions to protect water bodies, aquatic ecosystems and soil functionality, and further enhancing water quality and its management for safe human and ecological use, while fostering the European position and role in the global water scene.”
Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
A wider use of a better understanding and an enhanced knowledge base required to assess pollution sources, pathways and combined effects on drinking water systems, including forward looking approaches aimed to anticipate and prepare for future or emerging challenges.
Implement advanced preventive and mitigating strategies and measures to protect drinking water sources, treatment and supply against harmful effects of global and climate change.
Apply effective risk assessment and risk management strategies enabling early warning systems and delivering ready-made outputs for decision-making and governance.
Exploit advanced, integrated and cost-effective water quality sensors and analytical methods.
Deploy innovative and robust monitoring systems and real-time information on drinking water quality, from sources to supply.
Disseminate and use a robust knowledge on the occurrence, persistence and degradability of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water with due consideration to operational parameters, chemicals, materials and biofilms interactions, including the pathways related to human exposure.
Spread the use of advanced and cost-effective drinking water treatment and disinfection processes and technologies, including transformative approaches.
Broad uptake of advanced knowledge, breakthrough solutions and innovative technologies to enhance competitiveness of the EU water sector and fostering the EU’s position and role in the global water scene.
Increasing the EU scientific and technological base and guidance on measures to manage drinking water quality and evidence for policy-making, safety planning and implementation.
Science and evidence-based implementation of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals, notably the SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”.
Scope:
The European Union policy framework has secured public safety and health objectives by the Drinking Water, Bathing Water and Floods Directives (EU, 1998, 2006, 2007), and the ongoing development and implementation of minimum requirements for water reuse. Despite the valuable output of implemented measures, some persistent problems are still a major, and sometimes unknown, risk factor for human and ecosystem health. Past contaminated sites and industrial activities managing hazardous chemicals, such as highly persistent compounds, together with agriculture and food production (pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics etc.), and household activities release a number of substances that individually or combined represent a concern for the safety of drinking water supplies. Detrimental effects of natural/human-made disasters and increasing water temperatures due to climate change could deteriorate the quality of drinking water sources by favouring the conditions for enhanced eutrophication leading to algal and cyanobacterial outbreaks as well as pathogen development or the spread of invasive species. Emerging concerns are also rising at the level of drinking water treatment and distribution, notably in relation to disinfection operations, materials and products, ageing infrastructure, biofilm growth and possible harmful effects of unintentionally formed by-products and metabolites.
Actions in this field should aim to expand the knowledge base required to identify, assess and prevent pollution threats (micro-pollutants, pathogens, toxins, algal blooms, etc.) and the combined effects of multiple stressors on water sources, including risk assessment and management, to protect drinking water preparation and distribution. Particular attention to extreme weather events and possible synergistic effects affecting hydraulic flows, temperatures and pollutants’ loads should be considered, whenever appropriate.
Advanced water quality assessment needs further development of sensors sensitivity, automated routine monitoring and fast analytical responses that fully integrate IT advances. Proposals in this topic should aim to extend the current analytical capacity to enable among other issues the detection of suspect and non-targeted pollutants, resulting in robust and reliable monitoring systems for consideration in future legislation. They should also consider the requirements of the revised Drinking Water Directive as regards catchment management.
Unintended disinfection by-products (DBP) and interactions with chemical reagents used for drinking water treatment (DWT), engineering and contact materials as well as the combined effects of biofilms formation are emerging as hazardous chemical risks that could affect human health. Proposals in this field should further extend the knowledge base of mechanisms and reactions leading to DBP formation by analysing raw water quality and precursors, as well assessing DWT operational parameters, including disinfection needs, methods and doses. Advanced DWT solutions should explore integrated systems coupling different treatment technologies and strategies enabling the optimization of the operational DWT effectiveness while removing DBP risks.
In general, the participation of academia, research organisations, utilities, industry and regulators is strongly advised, as well as civil society engagement whenever necessary, also aiming to broaden the dissemination and exploitation routes and to better assess the innovation potential of developed solutions and strategies.
If appropriate, applicants are advised to seek complementarities and synergies, while avoiding duplication and overlap, with relevant actions funded under Horizon 2020 calls[1], as well as targeted topics supported in the last Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe calls, addressing micro/nano-plastics, persistent and mobile pollutants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs), pathogens and antimicrobial resistance. Whenever possible, proposals should consider already developed digital solutions for real-time water monitoring systems. Activities related to water reclamation and reuse, indirect potable use or alternative water sources are beyond the scope of this topic.
In order to better address some or all of the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Specific Topic Conditions:
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.

","26 August 2021
","07 April 2022","Objective:
In the context of the CISE transitional phase, the main objectives of this call for proposals are to enhance the cooperation between public maritime authorities (including European Commission Services and EU Agencies) by promoting the development of at least 2 services at pre-operational phase and to foster the uptake of CISE in view of its operationalisation. The developed services at pre-operational phase should relate to risk and incident alerting services [1] that use CISE for information exchange.
These services are meant to be complementary to information exchanged through the legacy systems of user communities. In no way these services will substitute or replace existing systems and existing legal obligations under European and/or international law.
CISE aims at giving users the possibility to add or to top-up missing information to the information available in their legacy systems. These services should give the possibility to complete information by reaching out to a wider variety of Public Authorities connected to the CISE network.
Proposals should focus on rolling out information services capable of supporting the work of the relevant authorities, addressing at least 3 use cases in the pre-operational environment. It should involve authorities from as many sectors as possible of those identified in the CISE communication [2].
The proposed services should facilitate the work of operators to carry out their tasks in the context of the identified use cases by sharing the needed information, in a timely manner, in their operational system (legacy). The automatic sharing of information on the selected services, should aim at reducing the workload at the operational level and further enhancing the decision-making process at tactical level. Therefore, the exchange of information shall be automatized connecting the legacy systems of the authorities involved (no simulator or dedicated client) and the actual use of the received information by the receiving legacy system should be proven.
Applicants should explain in their proposal how the implementation of the targeted activities will result in concrete and measurable results within the project's duration. Proposals should demonstrate how added value is provided to existing systems.
The implemented services addressing use cases should be piloted for at least 6 months in the operational network, targeting real events. In this regard the applicant should design an operational report where events and/or target activities should be documented.
[1] The “incident alerting service” refers to incidents occurring on board vessels or any other type of maritime asset. The “risk service” aims at harmonizing the interpretation of the risks by the different authorities involved in CISE.
[2] COM(2010) 584 final on a Draft Roadmap towards establishing the Common Information Sharing Environment for the surveillance of the EU maritime domain.
Scope:
The project should use as many existing CISE Nodes as possible. Furthermore, the project should seek for the engagement of new stakeholders. Should the installation of new nodes in the network be required, the CISE team (i.e. EMSA and JRC) will provide the needed technical guidance.
All the services developed during this project should be in compliance with the specifications of the CISE data and service model [1].To facilitate the uptake of the new services within the CISE community and to facilitate the maintenance and the interoperability with the existing CISE adaptors, each new adaptor should be specified and documented.
The services should be shared (consumed and provided) in the operational context, therefore addressed through standard operating procedures by duties officers in the stakeholder’ situational centre, for at least 6 months. The operational results of this activity shall be reported by an operational report, highlighting which operations CISE contributed to target or events that CISE contributed to detect.
Additionally, the proposal shall include a final demonstration exercise, which shall use a combination of the services developed in the frame of the project and the services already existing in the CISE network. The exercise shall be used to show and present the new services implemented to the whole CISE community. The exercises should demonstrate the added value of the information exchange in the operational selected scenarios.
Projects must undertake at least the following core activities as part of the project implementation:
Analysis of the Use cases selected;
Adaptation of the operational procedures and upgrading of the involved legacy systems to automatize the use of the newly available information and definition of relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs);
Design, development, and operation of the CISE adaptors required to provide and consume the information shared through the services;
Signing of CISE cooperation agreement to enable information exchange;
Deployment and operation of the pre-operational services for 6 months and doing an ex-post evaluation an analysis reporting on the results and achievements;
Organization and performing a demonstration event for the CISE community.
In addition, applicants should include the following complementary activity to support the above core activities:
Establishment of a Steering Committee (SC) to ensure the overall strategic steering of the project. The SC should comprise of representatives of the relevant Maritime sectors, as well as the involved beneficiaries. The Commission (JRC, MARE, and MOVE), EMSA and/or CINEA may participate in an observer capacity only.
[1] http://emsa.europa.eu/cise-documentation/cise-data-model-1.5.3/
Expected Impact:
The call is expected to foster the uptake of CISE bringing in new participants as well as the implementation and use of new operational services integrated with existing ones. Hence, at the end of the project, it is envisioned that new Member States will be connected to the CISE Network and those services will be used to support the involved authorities in the execution of their standard duties.
In addition, the project is expected to design, develop, implement, and fine tune through test, services that will be at a readiness level suitable for being routinely used in operation beyond the end of the project.
Other expected impacts are:
New and adapted operational procedures taking into account the new services;
Enhanced cross-sector and cross-border collaboration within the CISE network.
Stakeholders involved in the use of the services developed are encouraged to continue to support the use of these services in their operational system beyond the closure of the project."

In line with the European Green Deal’s zero pollution ambition, successful proposals will contribute to halting and preventing pollution of freshwater and soils, and consequently also protecting biodiversity, as addressed by several impacts under Destination ‘Clean environment and zero pollution’, in particular “Advanced understanding of diffuse and point sources of water pollution in a global and climate change context, enabling novel solutions to protect water bodies, aquatic ecosystems and soil functionality, and further enhancing water quality and its management for safe human and ecological use, while fostering the European position and role in the global water scene.”
Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Wider use of an enhanced knowledge base and better understanding of pollution sources, pathways and impacts, including surface hydrology, aquifers and receiving water bodies, as well as the synergistic effects of multiple stressors on groundwater quality.
Implement advanced prevention and mitigation strategies to protect groundwater against pollution induced by global and climate change, including anticipative approaches preparing for future or emerging challenges.
Apply effective risk assessment and risk management strategies enabling early warning systems and delivering ready-made outcomes for decision-making and governance.
Deploy innovative monitoring strategies, including advanced sensors, tracers and analytical methods, and integration of IT tools/platforms and advanced modelling.
Broad uptake of advanced knowledge, breakthrough solutions and innovative technologies to enhance the competitiveness of the EU water sector and foster the EU’s position and role in the global water scene.
Increasing the EU scientific and technological base on measures to manage groundwater quality and providing evidence and guidance for policy-making and implementation.
Science and evidence-based implementation of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals, notably the SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”.
Scope:
The European Union has made noticeable progress in terms of reducing concentrations of nutrients in groundwater and in rivers through the implementation of dedicated policy measures. However, Member States identified that diffuse pollution is still a significant pressure that affects 35% of the area of groundwater bodies[1], while quality standards (pesticides, herbicides, etc.) were exceeded in 15% of the groundwater bodies studied. Climate change and increasing water demand will exert significant pressures on groundwater quality, notably where the combined effect of reduced hydrological flows, water table depletion and sea level rise endanger the integrity of coastal aquifers and groundwater quality due to saline water intrusion. Extreme events like higher tides, storm surges and inland flooding events, and consequent pollutant and pathogen runoff, will put at risk wetlands and reservoirs, estuaries and ecosystems, jeopardising an efficient and qualitatively good groundwater recharge. Rising water tables in urban and rural areas, caused by e.g. higher sea level, changing water use or variable precipitation patterns, could potentially affect pollution sources (sewage, runoff infiltration, dilution of soil pollutants, salinization, etc.) and deteriorate the quality of groundwater.
Additional knowledge is needed to understand the synergistic effects and risks of multiple stressors and pollutants on groundwater quality to better evaluate the impacts of global and climate change, particularly in highly vulnerable areas affected by diffuse pollution, anthropogenic activities and/or water table fluctuations. Actions in this field should aim to identify and assess sources and pathways of groundwater pollution to inform risk management plans at basin/regional scales, with particular consideration of aquifer recharge with reclaimed water and persistent pollutants.
Further developments are expected in terms of cost-efficient monitoring strategies, which could include new tracers and sensors, increased sampling and analytical capacity, as well as integrating IT advances and geophysical modelling.
Proposals in this area should assess possible options and anticipate novel strategies to protect groundwater quality by considering the harmful effects of and threats from climate change. Actions in this field should focus on preventive measures and consider technological and non-technological solutions, and should engage with policy and decision-making bodies.
In general, the participation of academia, research organisations, utilities, industry and regulators is strongly advised, as well as civil society engagement whenever necessary, also aiming to broaden the dissemination and exploitation routes and to better assess the innovation potential of developed solutions and strategies.
If appropriate, applicants are advised to seek complementarities and synergies, while avoiding duplication and overlap, with relevant actions funded under Horizon 2020 calls[2], as well as targeted topics supported in the last Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe calls, addressing micro/nano-plastics, persistent and mobile pollutants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs), pathogens and antimicrobial resistance.
In order to better address some or all of the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.

In line with the zero pollution ambition, the farm to fork strategy, in particular promoting the global transition to sustainable food systems, successful proposals will support the development of Green Alliances on sustainable agro-food systems in relation to nutrient management that halt nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollution and limit N/P emissions to remain within safe ecological boundaries at European, regional and local scale. Moreover, selected proposals are expected to reinforce the transdisciplinary research and integrated scientific support for relevant EU policies and priorities (common agricultural policy (CAP), Green Deal objectives, etc.).
Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Strengthened international cooperation with actors from China in the areas of nutrient management to halt pollution and limit N/P emissions to remain within safe ecological boundaries at different scales while restoring water, air and soil ecosystems.
Develop and test Nature based Solutions (NBS)[1] to plant nutrition and health, with innovative technologies that optimise the use of external inputs and helps European farmers in the implementation of regulated deficit strategies.
Support for the implementation of the nutrient budget methodologies with new or improved technologies for different agricultural systems considering environmental, social and economic factors at different scales farms, regions and/or products.
Identification and management of potential new sources and pathways of nutrients through distribution/sharing of organic wastes at local level to reduce nutrient loads to soil and water bodies.
Uptake of knowledge and innovations in implementing a sustainable management of natural resources.
Scope:
The success implementation of a sustainable nutrient management plan requires the availability of the technologies to support farmers in their decision-making and applications of the nutrients plans, based on the type of production system, environmental conditions, soil type, water availability and socio-economic aspects of both crops and nutrients. Nature-based solutions (NBS) and innovative agricultural and environmental tools can improve nutrient management and strategies for, among other things, meeting the objectives of the European Green Deal, including the farm to fork strategy, and the biodiversity strategy, the circular economy action plan and the zero pollution action plan for air, water and soil.
Proposals should build on existing and new knowledge, data, models (including in situ calibration measurements) and available tools to:
Develop smart nutrient management plans and methods to prevent, mitigate and when possible eliminate pollution in soils, water and air caused by nutrients and water management practices, across sectors, for different types of agricultural practices (conventional, organic and agro-ecological agriculture), and scales – farm, local, regional and river basin.
Explore and assess the potential of alternative nutrient sources (organic vs inorganic), enhance management and recycling of organic wastes and explore nutrient recovery opportunities, for different agricultural systems.
Analyse the effect of NBS on climate change and crop productivity including nutrient availability, and interactions between nutrients and carbon cycles.
Develop models and tools to monitor nutrients flow based on remote sensing technologies and data, in agriculture and forestry systems: for physical, chemical and biological parameters.
Engage with technology development actors, farmers and investors organising large scale online hackathon activities to support tech services for farmers at farm and local level in their nutrient management plans e.g. by allowing targeted field application of fertilisers (organic / inorganic), and addressing geographical imbalances in nutrient flows.
Develop Decision Support Systems to assess and understand the performance and relative merits of NBS for nutrient management.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector and, as relevant, bio-based industries active in rural areas.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Actions will contribute to implementing the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) flagship initiative, which aims to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population, the reduction of food and agricultural losses and waste, and the provision of safe and healthy foodstuffs.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China. This topic is envisaged to be implemented as a coordinated call but if no agreement is reached with the Ministry of Science and Technology China (MOST) on the co-funding of Chinese partners, it will be implemented as a normal call.

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In support of the implementation of the Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy, successful proposals will contribute to all the following expected outcomes notably to better understand biodiversity decline, its main direct drivers and their interrelations:
Next generation fit for purpose and user friendly, validated and integrated coastal, marine and terrestrial biodiversity observation, mapping and monitoring tools (from remote sensing to eDNA, AI, robotics and citizen science framework) that provide data to feed models of prediction of biodiversity (for global and regional scales to define and update ecosystem-based management approaches).
Fulfil the objectives of the Global Biodiversity Observation Network (The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network – GEOBON, MBON, GOOS)
Empowering ocean observations (e.g., citizen science framework, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data analytics) and robust science-based thinking at national and international levels will promote science diplomacy and wider societal actions to support responsible and sustainability thereby enhancing ocean governance
Coastal, marine and terrestrial biological processes and biodiversity are integrated into national, regional (including EU and AC sea basins), and global observation systems. Reliable and affordable methods for monitoring water quality in line with the MSFD and WFD, which would generate information that is geo referenced and available more in real time.
In line with the targets of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, contribute to establish a network of effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative, protected areas and/or other area-based effective conservation measures.
“Blue Carbon” balance model in the different marine ecosystems for possible use for carbon offsetting and for Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
Scope:
Better biodiversity observations are needed to assess the health of ecosystems and the impact of measures derived from EU policies, and to feed data into models for the predictions of effects and the development of management measures for the implementation of EU policies.
Observation and mapping of coastal and marine biodiversity are key tools to manage and share the “ocean commons” in a fair and responsible way under the present global challenges and rapid environmental changes. They also help ensure that the benefits derived from the exploitation of ocean resources can be sustainably managed and equitably shared. The distribution of these “ocean commons” is changing. The melting polar ice caps, stagnation in wild seafood provisioning opportunities, emergence of harmful pathogens and parasites, and previously inaccessible ocean spaces (e.g. the deep sea) now increasingly within human reach, are challenges that need to be addressed by responsible ocean governance to reduce the potential for conflicts at all levels and ensure human well-being. Current knowledge on how to relate and govern marine natural resources and associated societal changes is fragmented, and observations of resource distribution, use, state and dynamics are scant and insufficiently accessible. We need to advance observations to support modelling of the complex links between marine ecosystems and societal developments to forecast, manage and mitigate these changes.
Adequate scientific knowledge is also fundamental to protect and restore favourable conservation status of habitats and species under EU nature legislation, notably the Birds and Habitats Directive and good ecological status under the Water Framework Directive. Reliable data and knowledge are necessary inter alia to define protected areas in line with the EU biodiversity strategy and its underlying legislation, to develop conservation objectives, conservation and restoration measures, to define the conservation status and to undertake environmental impact assessments.
In order to do so, projects are expected to encompass all of the following aspects:
Use of satellite and drone images (earth observation) to assess pressures on freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems (fragmentation, hydromorphological changes, etc.);
Develop eDNA protocols complementing established biological indicators to monitor ecological status, in the context of the Water Framework Directive.
New platforms and integration of variety of sensors in situ, autonomous unmanned vehicles, acoustic monitoring, satellite applications, holistic approaches (e.g., systems biology, meta-omics, and ecosystem approaches) and novel theoretical frameworks linking evolutionary theory and oceanography as well as marine social sciences and humanities can provide an integrated framework to inform decision making, particularly in inherently dynamic coastal ecosystems.
Where relevant, creating links, contributing to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), European Space Agency Earth Observation Programme and in particular the flagship actions on biodiversity and ocean health of the EC-ESA Joint Earth system science initiative, is expected.
Contribute to improving the knowledge on marine and terrestrial habitats and species protected under the Birds and Habitats Directive.
Contribute to improving the knowledge on how invasive alien species interact with local biodiversity to better feed policies on their prevention, eradication and management In line with EU Regulation 1143/2014 on invasive alien species,
Implement the Essential Ocean Variables for sustained observations of marine biodiversity and ecosystem changes identified by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).
The projects should benefit from the large datasets recovered from the long-term environmental monitoring conducted through the national and European dedicated Research Infrastructures (e.g. eLTER).
Technical, theoretical and practical development and validation for the use of environmental DNA (eDNA), combined with other ocean data (both biotic and abiotic). These approaches promise leaps in our ability to sample ecosystem-wide data at increasingly low costs.
Investigate all key processes (ecological and anthropogenic) controlling the fate of carbon and its sequestration in marine and costal ecosystems. Evaluate the “Blue Carbon” balance in the different marine ecosystems through high-resolution mapping and modelling of marine ecosystems of the European EEZ, characterised by habitats, species, processes and functions, from deep sea, offshore to coastal.
The tools, models and geo-referenced information systems that should be designed should be focused on user needs and designed with user experience.
Standardised minimum set of Essential Ocean and Biodiversity Variables (EOVs / EBVs)
Contribution to enhancing the overall societal and public understanding of link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning through education and training (school & adult education, citizen science platforms)
All the marine observations connected though these actions should be incorporated into EMODnet.
Cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and other relevant existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms[1].
Contribute to the free and open access to biodiversity data of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.
Opportunities for cooperation with relevant projects, such as EUROPABON [2] awarded under the call ‘SC5-33-2020: Monitoring ecosystems through research, innovation and technology’ or the projects resulting from topics under the Heading ‘Understanding biodiversity decline’ in Destination ‘Biodiversity and ecosystem services’ and from Destination ‘Land, ocean and water for climate action’ (Carbon cycle and natural processes) and Destination ‘Innovative governance, environmental observations and digital solutions in support of the Green Deal’ (environmental observation) should be identified. Furthermore, cooperation is expected with the European co-funded partnership on biodiversity[3] (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and other relevant Horizon Europe missions and partnerships. Proposals should outline a plan on how they intend to collaborate with other projects selected and with the mentioned initiatives, by participating in e.g. joint activities, workshops, common communication and dissemination activities, etc. Applicants should allocate the necessary budget to cover the plan. Relevant activities of the plan will be set out and carried out in close co-operation with relevant Commission services, ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

Projects will contribute to the expected impacts identified for Destination ‘Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors’, and to the European policies it supports, in particular the European Green Deal, the circular economy action plan and the Bioeconomy and biodiversity strategies. Their results will help to improve the European industrial[1] sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence by lowering the environmental footprint (including on biodiversity), enabling climate-neutrality and higher resource efficiency (in particular upcycling and cascading use of biomass) along and across value chains, developing innovative bio-based products. They will engage all stakeholders and improve their knowledge and understanding of science, in particular biotechnology-based value chains
Projects results should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Deeper understanding of the molecular, biochemical and cellular mechanisms of ecological adaptation of terrestrial and aquatic organisms in response to life under extreme or changing environments, while strengthening the remediation options at macro level for the studied populations, including by their interactions, thus contributing to expanding the range of potential climate change mitigation strategies.
Stronger innovation capacity by applying the discovered principles (including via biotechnology routes) to the development of more resilient innovative feedstocks needed for sustainable bio-based products[2]
A significantly improved environmental footprint of novel feedstocks based on discovered principles[3], and a wider range of sustainable biomass resources available to European industry, that are important for industrial competitiveness and SMEs participation, thus helping to create skilled jobs and boost the economy.
Increased public understanding in Europe of biotechnology, the conservation of biodiversity, and EU biodiversity strategy goals. Respect of the principles of access and benefit sharing (UN Biodiversity Convention), via clear, inclusive and transparent communication strategies.
Scope:
The topic covers R&D needed to advance and potentially exploit knowledge on the ways terrestrial and aquatic organisms and their populations adapt, on molecular, physiological, and ecological levels, to the effects of climate change, such as by tolerance to extreme temperatures, drought/water stress, salinity or increased biotic pressures (new pests), as observed at macro-scale (e.g. shifting ecological niches). The scope covers understanding the complex interactions between the affected populations (e.g. molecular signalling), and broader outcomes on an ecological level. International cooperation is strongly encouraged to maximise the impact.
Where relevant, proposals should seek synergies and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing research projects. Proposals should:
Identify and justify the choice of the selected organism or system under investigation, specifying the level and characteristics of the environmental stimuli covered (i.e. extreme or changing environment linked to climatic conditions).
Consider the broader level of climate adaptation in the systems identified, in order to shed light on the possibility and magnitude of applying the discovered principles as part of a mitigation strategy.
Engage with industrial actors including SMEs to identify and implement the best combination of appropriate technical solutions and in particular biotechnology for specific industrial value chains, for sustainable biomass generation, taking into account the barriers and drivers derived from governance and market aspects, while seeking engagement and understanding of all actors.
Develop and communicate the key methods to monitor and measure the qualitative and quantitative impacts of these solutions and practices for different biomass sourcing, optimization, processing and production systems, the potential of replacing available traditional alternatives, if relevant, and trade-offs, including for biodiversity, and potential benefits in terms of the socioeconomic resilience of businesses, job creation and industrial competitiveness.
Develop and test mechanisms with all actors, notably the research community and bio-based industry. Exchange knowledge on and demonstrate solutions for improved bio-based products and processes and for addressing other environmental impacts such as on biodiversity to agricultural operators, farmers, fishers, foresters, SMEs and the broader public, and help them implement them.

Projects outcomes will enable achieving the expected impacts of the destination by increasing access to primary raw materials, in particular critical raw materials for EU industrial value chains and strategic sectors.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Exchange of good practices in permitting procedures related to extractive activities that may have an impact in environmentally protected areas;
Dissemination and exploitation of projects outputs is tailored for competent EU, national and regional authorities, industry and civil society in EU Member States.
Scope:
Reconciling the increasing demand for Critical Raw Materials necessary for the EU climate neutral ambition, with nature protection, restoration and biodiversity enhancement, requires strengthening the raw materials policy framework. Streamlining more efficient, effective and transparent permitting procedures throughout the mineral extraction life-cycle in environmentally protected areas, would contribute to securing the sustainable access to primary raw materials, whilst taking into account and reconciling requirements in environmentally protected areas.
The actions should contribute to the exchange of good practices in permitting procedures related to extractive activities that may have an impact on environmentally protected areas. They should focus on reviewing good practices at the permitting stage in areas such as evaluating natural background conditions previous to the mineral extraction, evaluating the impact on human health and biodiversity, as well as foreseen nature protection and restoration measures. Particular attention will have to be paid to the legal obligations and practices ensuring compliance with EU nature legislation (Birds and Habitats Directives) and the goals of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030.
The actions should analyse cross-sectorial policy coordination and integration covering economic, environmental and social aspects in the value chain of the extractive life cycle from finding and access to deposits to closure and rehabilitation, while focusing on the contribution of streamlined permitting procedures to deliver on the climate ambition of the European Green Deal.
The actions should develop and disseminate analyses (including on the most affected raw materials, categories of sites, pressures, impact assessment methods, mitigation and compensation measures etc.) and training material; organise capacity-building workshops and seminars for competent authorities, industry and civil society in different Member States and other countries in Europe. These activities can also address other countries that are eligible to participate.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU. Renovation of existing old buildings has the potential to lead to significant energy savings – potentially reducing the EU's total energy consumption by 5-6% and lowering CO2 emissions by about 5%;
Compared to state of the art materials and components, the newly developed materials should deliver:
Reduction by at least 30% of the embodied energy and CO2 at component level;
Improvement by at least 20% of insulation properties;
Reduction by at least 15% of the total costs compared to existing solutions;
Demonstration of at least a 5% reduction of the energy spent during the whole life cycle of a building.
Increased durability and lifetime, lower maintenance costs and environmental footprint.
Demonstrate innovative retrofitting solutions using the building insulation materials as real cases approaching net zero energy standards and their replicability potential;
Improvement of the quality of information from product manufacturers to facilitate better decision making;
Strengthening of the competitiveness of the European construction sector in the field of “green” construction technologies;
Sustainable building materials will be supporting the circular design. Self-sustaining buildings in respect to energy usage;
New insulation materials should be cost effective, environmentally safe, fire resistant and can be easily applied on existing surfaces (e.g. spray coating);
Return on investment should be below 7 years for deep retrofitting of buildings;
Advent of a new generation of skilled workers and SME contractors in the construction sector aware of the need of a systemic approach towards energy efficiency should be promoted through the proposed activities.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
Building envelopes and renovation materials that boost energy savings, save resources and decrease carbon emissions, both during construction and operation of the buildings. In view of the climate targets, Europe's building infrastructure needs a deep rehabilitation of residential buildings (including buildings of historic value) while lowering the costs of refurbishment. Building materials with adequate insulation properties are directly related to the Green Deal and the well-being of our citizens.
Proposals should address and demonstrate several of the below activities:
Demonstrating that new insulation materials (not external cladding) will have reduced embodied energy, lower CO2 emissions and improved insulation properties during operation, and are cost effective, environmentally safe, fire resistant and can be easily applied on existing surfaces (e.g. spray coating);
New components should also contribute to improve indoor air quality, by limiting VOCs emissions and/or by advanced properties aiming to absorb and biodegrade indoor contaminants;
Enhanced durability for increased use duration, reduced maintenance and consequently reduced costs, respect of sustainability principles (the sustainability of each developed solution should be evaluated via life cycle assessment studies carried out according to the International Reference Life Cycle Data System - ILCD Handbook);
New components should have to be lightweight construction with an ease of installation and provide for increased comfort and noise reduction, and find application to both new build and renovation and deliver realistic solutions at a reasonable price;
Energy efficiency should be addressed by system integration and installation, exploiting synergies between technologies, which proved valid at a small scale and need a larger scale demonstration;
Synergy with existing relevant Open Innovation Test Beds is encouraged;
Clustering and cooperation with other relevant projects is strongly encouraged; in particular, liaison and synergies with the Horizon Europe Partnership on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ and Build4People.
Building materials with adequate insulation properties are directly related to the Green Deal and the well-being of our citizens.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Increase significantly the large-scale deployment and demonstration of Climate Neutral and Circular Innovative Materials Technologies across sectors and the single market, as well as to build and maintain new innovative value chains;
Reduce the technological risk of innovative materials and products, thus attracting more investors, and cut the time to market;
Support companies, especially SMEs, to become world leaders in clean products and technologies by setting up a new generation of Open Innovation test Beds focused on the creation of Business Opportunities and Sustainability. Enhancing ownership and engagement of the society through active collaboration and empowering people and communities as actors of the climate neutral and circular transition ;
Translation of industrial needs into scientific problems and concrete solutions, increased awareness and uptake by industry, and effective access of relevant stakeholders to know-how and advanced tools/infrastructure.
Scope:
The following specific activities should be considered:
Establish Open Innovation Test Beds (OITB) by upgrading existing or developing new materials facilities and pilot lines, and made available services for the design, development, testing, regulatory and environmental assessment and upscaling to industry and interested parties, specially SMEs;
Specific focus will be given to the sustainability of the ecosystem by designing new funding instruments that would complement the already existing ones and provide further support for industrial uptake of climate neutral and circular innovative materials technologies in key strategic value chains;.
Proposals should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects, to enhance user involvement and to reuse other projects results;
Open access at fair conditions and cost as well as outreach and dissemination across Europe, based on a distinct methodology;
Demonstrate measurable reduction of costs for product design, time-to-market and regulatory compliance by means of faster and cheaper evaluation of production process deviations. Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
In order to avoid duplication, the work will be aligned with the third pillar on Open Innovation that will essentially focus on scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation by establishing a European Innovation Council, support the enhancement of European ecosystems of innovation and continued support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) OITB for: Clean hydrogen Technologies; Fuel cells and other alternative fuels; Carbon capture, storage and utilisation.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Achieve a significant reduction in reconfiguration time, which includes all steps between stopping a production, reconfiguration of the individual production steps, requalification, adjustment of the intra-logistics processes, and ramping up to a full production speed;
Develop validated standardised interfaces and protocols to enable digitalised and thus flexible manufacturing processes;
Develop protocols for best practices in rapid reconfiguration applicable not only for the products and sectors present in the project, but also transferable to other sectors and application areas.
Scope:
In times of disrupted supply chains or rapidly changing customer demands, production lines will need to be built flexible enough to be able to handle these variations. Rapid reconfiguration technologies of more flexible systems, will enable industries with many production process steps to maintain a resilience against sudden changes in ordering and/or supplies.
The projects should address reconfiguration of production systems in which the lines are running at medium or high volume manufacturing rates (MVM and HVM respectively), and include a variety of production steps, such as cleaning, forming, thermal treatments, cutting, joining, surface treatments, painting, printing, assembly, etc. It should also consider complex logistics and non-manufacturing operations enabling the production runs. Projects should provide strategies for awareness and early detection of reconfiguration needs, e.g. by using A.I. and data technologies, to enhance their resilience towards threatening events or crisis situations.
The reconfiguration should be ambitious to the extent that the change addresses a new customer base or new societal needs, or drastically changes the original production processes and/or supply chain with minimal reconfiguration costs.
Projects should also include protocols for best practices of the reconfiguration that can be applicable also outside the sectors active in the project, which would include taking into account any sector specific qualification requirements (such as clean room levels or certifications for sectors such as medical and food). These protocols as well as the projects should have a human-centred perspective, including skills requirements and training adapted to different education levels and needs.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.
Research must build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed. Additionally, a strategy for skills development should be presented, associating social partners when relevant.
All projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, International Cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan, South Korea or Canada.

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
A comprehensive socio-economic evaluation of future climate change impacts across sectors, countries/regions, timescales and climate building on socio-economic scenarios with improved sectoral, cross-sectoral and spatial resolution of impact projections.
Improved climate change related decision support based on better understanding (and quantification) of the socio-economic risks (and opportunities), associated with climate change impact, for both sudden onset extreme events and slow onset processes.
Better evidence for ambitious climate policy response, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation measures, based on a better understanding of socio-economic risks in the absence of adequate mitigation and adaptation efforts (or when limits to adaptation are reached), leading to a more secure and more certain socio-economic future.
Actionable insights based on data at the appropriate level of geographical scale and spatial resolution for decision-makers in public and private sectors, including national and regional level estimations, leading to enhanced adaptation efforts and to a more resilient Europe.
Better integration of climate change risks in public and private sectors’ investment decisions - from property, through infrastructure up to regional and national supply chains - leading to increased long-term resilience.
Enhanced coordination with European Commission’s Joint Research Centre on research concerning climate impacts and adaptation modelling.
Provision of authoritative knowledge to inform the activities of the Horizon Europe Mission on Adaptation to climate change including societal transformation.
Scope:
Actions should improve the understanding of the nature and extent of physical risks from a changing climate and their integrated socio-economic implications in Europe in 2030, 2050 and 2100 timeframes. The analysis should evaluate the costs of inaction / “business as usual” by extrapolating current policies with different social and climatological scenarios. It should seek to capture the range of possible socio-economic climate-related risks including both those most likely to occur as well as those associated with low-probability high-impact climate events with potentially catastrophic outcomes. Indirect impacts should be part of the analysis as well as the impacts in the rest of the world with relevant spill over effects in Europe should also be considered.
A comparison with scenarios with lower degrees of warming (with ambitious mitigation measures) should be included as well as the analysis of the costs and benefits of ambitious adaptation measures. Research should also improve the understanding of climate-related risks that are unlikely to be avoided through mitigation and/or adaptation and require urgent/specific response. The work could encompass improvements in adaptation modelling, in particular in impact areas with the highest potential damages. Actions should also take into account the impact of radical transformations envisaged in the context of the post-COVID recovery.
The impacts of climate risks should be assessed and monetised across various economic sectors aiming at an expansion of the existing impact categories and combining them into a coherent framework. Cross-sectorial impacts taking into account the interactions between various sectors should also be addressed. This research should equally encompass impact categories that cannot be directly monetised, but with either economy-wide implications or of critical importance for future human well-being, such as health (including the spread of infectious diseases), social justice, and biodiversity/ecosystems. The development of appropriate tools and methodologies that are able to address these kinds of non-market based impacts is part of the scope. In addition, actions should aim at accounting for the various sources of uncertainty in a systematic way.
A national, and as much as possible regional, resolution should be aimed at in order to account for heterogeneity in terms of hazards, exposure, vulnerability (including adaptive capacities) and ability to manage risks across countries and regions. Distributional and further equity considerations, including gender, associated with climate change impacts should also be investigated in order to inform the formulation of just mitigation and adaptation strategies. Development and testing of rapid analysis and assessment techniques using open data, tools and methodologies as well as work on an economy-wide damage function relating GDP losses or other metrics of public welfare and human wellbeing with temperature increase, could be part of the research, too.
Actions should identify and formulate recommendations for measures that should be implemented by various stakeholders groups to minimise the climate risks across Europe as well as the needs for future research. They should explore effective ways for bridging the gap between science, policy and practice. The needs of the private sector in order to prepare for and adapt to climate change impacts should be an integral part of the work and could include development of approaches for better integration of climate risks into financing principles of the investment community.
This topic calls for a truly interdisciplinary approach combining a wide range of disciplines including economics, climate science, bio-geophysical modelling, data engineering, risk analysis, political and behavioural science etc. as well as for an active involvement of and co-creation with people and communities at risk. As much as possible, it should integrate the results of the existing studies and evidence-base, including from previously funded projects such as COACCH and other projects from call SC5-06-2016-2017[1].
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles[2]. In particular, beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to publish results data in open access databases and/or as annexes to publications. In addition, full openness of any new modules, models or tools developed from scratch or substantially improved with the use of EU funding is expected.
Synergies with topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D1-01-05: Better understanding of the interactions between climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation options, as well as with relevant topics in Cluster 3: Civil security for Society – Destination Area DRS02 on Support to improved disaster risk management and governance, should be explored and established. In addition, coordination with existing relevant initiatives on climate impacts and adaptation modelling should also be sought, including the PESETA assessment[3], in order to stimulate the use of common simulation protocols in European climate risk assessments, enlarge the coverage of climate impact areas, and improve the complementarity of modelling efforts.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Support to the implementation of the new EU Adaptation Strategy and the Mission on adaptation to climate change, including societal transformation, through better access to improved knowledge about climate impacts and fit-for-purpose data on individual and collective climate risks for all levels of government and stakeholders.
Reduced vulnerability to climate change impacts based on decadal predictions which are a key source of information for better planning of adaptation options.
Improved assessment of risks for people and systems exposed to extreme weather and climate events.
Enhanced scientific collaboration and exploitation of synergies across the EU and Associated Countries for the provision of climate information to stakeholders engaged with the implementation of the EU Adaptation Strategy.
Enhanced European cooperation and leadership in climate sciences e.g. in the frame of the Euro-CORDEX initiative, a part of WCRP’s Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment project (CORDEX).
Scope:
Proposals should aim at improving seasonal to decadal prediction to boost their quality at regional to local scale in particular for Europe and for variables of high societal relevance. Actions will enable progress in closing the gap between current skill and potential predictability estimates, as well as better aligning with immediate adaptation needs of end-users and making those predictions actionable. Ultimately, methodologies need to be developed to merge simulations from long-term weather forecast to climate predictions and projections, resulting in seamless climate information from sub-seasonal to seasonal and decadal predictions for the next 30 years.
Proposals should also improve assessments of risk through extreme climate-related events on a range of temporal and spatial scales, as well as early detection of tipping points. Tackle uncertainties regarding regional patterns and magnitude of changes and improve understanding of how existing model biases affect the representation of extremes regarding the intensity and frequency of hazards, including the co-variability of different risk factors, and ultimately reducing the biases.
Better exploiting climate variables can enhance consistency with impact models and avoid potential mismatches, leading to better understanding of interactions between climate system and other natural and socio-economic systems (e.g. insurance practices) as well as feedbacks related to land use and cover, urban dynamics, air quality, etc., which are very relevant for model simulations at regional scale. Actions should explore novel ways of coupling existing impact models with climate models to provide quality forecast at the local scale, focussing for example on cities. Actions are encouraged to develop guidance on selection or aggregation of model data for local impact assessments, with clear justification of the procedures, allowing transformation of uncertainty into a manageable package of information.
Coordination with the Destination Earth initiative can be proposed to ensure the timely development of “climate replicas” building on the new state-of-the-art IT infrastructure, including access to European high performance computing resources and an operational platform to upload and integrate the models and data developed in the course of the projects. Data should be FAIR[1] and based on standards. Models should also be fully documented in terms of assumptions, architecture, code and data.
Participants should also ensure synergies with relevant projects and initiatives (e.g. Digital Twin of the Ocean under the EU Green Deal call LC-GD-9-3-2020: Transparent & Accessible Seas and Oceans: Towards a Digital Twin of the Ocean and the Digital Europe Programme).
Model development should be properly connected with major programmes in the domain of Earth Observation such as the Copernicus Programme and the ESA science satellite missions in Europe, as well as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) at global level.
Actions should ensure the dissemination of project results to policy-makers and stakeholders to support long-term planning. International cooperation is encouraged with the aim to ensure the sharing of knowledge and experience between Europe and third countries on climate change impact and adaptation option modelling and assessment.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
A characterisation of future expected land use patterns consistent with long-term objectives (especially on climate, biodiversity and renewable energy) and its comparison with the current situation and trends.
A comprehensive understanding of the key motivations and drivers (economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, environmental, etc.) behind land-use related decisions in Europe at levels ranging from land owners to public authorities at local, regional and national level, including their relative importance.
A better understanding of the awareness of key actors (land owners, managers, local authorities, regulatory agencies) about climate change and biodiversity challenges and their willingness to contribute addressing them, including the adoption of new or different practices consistent with long-term expectations.
Support to climate (mitigation, adaptation) and biodiversity policy design and implementation through economic and behavioural insights allowing the efficient targeting of incentives and engagement of stakeholders in a cost-effective manner, taking into account telecoupling (displacement effects through changes in imports and exports).
Scope:
Actions should aim to gain a realistic understanding of the factors behind land-use decisions and how they can be best oriented towards the efficient and socially responsible pursuit of multiple policy objectives on various scales (from the individual field/farm to region to national to continental scale). They should develop a toolbox of instruments and approaches deployable at different levels consistent with long-term goals and strategies considering, inter alia:
The need for land to provide net sequestration and biomass flows consistent with the demands of various mitigation pathways, on different timescales.
The continued need for land to provide food, feed and raw materials under increasing climate change and other pressures and needs (e.g., water availability, climate change resilience).
The potential for demand-side measures that can contribute to long-term objectives (such as sustainable and healthy dietary change) and how they can be deployed.
The crucial need for halting and, if possible, reversing biodiversity loss in Europe and globally.
The socioeconomic dynamics, behavioural patterns and inertia related to land ownership, management and policies.
The considerable diversity of land use patterns, approaches and biogeographic conditions in Europe, including land-related resources such as water.
The need to make the instruments and approaches, including collective learning and negotiation processes at local and landscape scale, widely and practically available to the key actors, to enable sustainable change.
The need to avoid rebound (detrimental displacement effects).
Actions should focus on one or more of the following issues:
Development of realistic scenarios and workable models for optimising the contribution of land to climate change mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity objectives, where possible integrating with Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), consistent with expectations while reducing conflicts, exploiting synergies and managing risks (agroforestry can be one example of a system that allows higher productivity, more resilience and more biodiversity at the same time).
Economic and behavioural insights into land use related decisions, barriers to change, efficient design of incentives. This should explore the relative merits of instruments (regulatory, market-based, education, soft policy).
Explore a range of delivery mechanisms that could best incentivise the upscaling of the required changes under real-life situations in multiple settings (countries, biogeographical regions).
Develop workable models for effective and efficient monitoring and incentivising public goods benefits (such as emissions reductions, biodiversity protection and water services).
Contribute to the better quantification of land-related greenhouse gas flux trajectories for integrated assessment models on relevant scales (including displacement effects).
Participation of and co-creation with relevant societal stakeholders should be part of the action, including interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and the contribution from social sciences and humanities and other relevant disciplines.
Synergies should be ensured with topics related to land-use, biodiversity and ecosystems in Cluster 5 and in other Clusters, with the implementation of the Mission on Adaptation to climate change including societal transformation, as well as with other relevant actions, programmes and initiatives[1].
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH and gender expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved adequacy of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to effectively contribute to international, European, national and regional climate policy processes in support of the implementation of the European Green Deal, the Paris Agreement, COVID-19 recovery and broader sustainability goals
Contributions to major international scientific assessments such as the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the International Resource Panel (IRP).
Increased robustness, legitimacy, relevance, usability and transparency of IAMs leading to increased uptake and better awareness of their results across various end-user groups, developing, where possible, new business models for IAMs transparency (for example, open source and open code options).
Enhanced coherence between climate action (mitigation, understanding of impacts, climate risks and adaptation) and other environmental/sustainability objectives, notably biodiversity, based on a more realistic representation of their interactions, including co-benefits and trade-offs.
More active involvement of citizens in climate action based on better understanding and demonstration of how small scale actions contribute to the achievement of large-scale climate policy objectives including through socially innovative approaches, and better understanding of which actions/policies are more effective.
Ultimately, accelerated transition towards climate neutrality based on improved knowledge and better designed policies that are more integrated, greener, healthier, more inclusive.
Scope:
Actions should improve the state-of-the-art of IAMs by tackling their existing weaknesses and lack of/limited capabilities of the current generation of models in order to provide robust, credible and transparent evidence-base in support of design and evaluation of multiscale (global, European, national, regional) mitigation policies at various time horizons.
An important goal of this call is to address multiple challenges in a coherent and consistent manner using an integrated framework. To achieve this goal, it is not compulsory to incorporate all issues into a single IAM. Combinations of hard linking, soft linking and other ways of insuring a coherent approach between models and experts can be considered.
Actions should address developments and improvements, such as:
Sectorial detail and (transformative/structural) changes across various sectors of the economy such as those resulting from increased circularity and digitalisation.
Temporal resolution and technological detail.
Spatial resolution with outputs suitable for national/regional level analysis.
Behavioural and lifestyle changes.
Distributional and equity effects of climate policies.
Interactions with the relevant sustainable development goals (such as co-benefits due to avoided impacts and trade-offs in areas such as health, biodiversity, food security etc.).
Climate change impacts, including the extent to which they can be avoided through mitigation action, synergies and trade-offs between climate mitigation and adaptation policies.
Financial sector and investment needs, including information in support of investment risk-reduction strategies to mobilise capital to finance the transition towards a climate-neutral economy.
Uncertainties and risk-management strategies for supporting mitigation policies.
The above list is non-exhaustive and actions also may propose new avenues of research, while duly justifying their choice and keeping in mind the impact on IAMs’ relevance and adequacy as a decision-support tool. Actions should also explore options for making models more capable of responding to external shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic or similar. While addressing the improvements, actions should take into account the modelling requirements and learnings resulting from the COVID-19 crisis.
Actions should build on the knowledge base developed by previous initiatives and are encouraged to establish links with other relevant projects financed from this work programme (e.g. circular economy, climate adaptation modelling) and by Horizon 2020. In order to avoid duplication of efforts, proposals should clearly demonstrate how they will go beyond the modelling state of art.
Actions are encouraged to explore alternative approaches to the mainstream economic assumptions typically underlying the models (such as fully functioning markets and perfect information) and aim at striking the right balance between model complexity and usability.
In order to maximise the impact, active involvement of the end-users (policy makers, business, civil society) in the co-design of models and validation of the outputs should be considered. Applicants should investigate and apply communication tools and strategies for improved interaction with stakeholders and dissemination of model results, duly accounting for the needs of non-technical audiences. They should further develop the thinking around the best ways to apply modelling insights to policies, including by building on the learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic. Consortia should also explore ways for better bridging the gap between modelling theory and practical applications, including in support of behavioural change and societal transformation.
It is recommended to include capacity-building efforts to lower the entrance barriers to the established IAM community by involving research teams in EU Member States and Associated Countries that are less advanced in terms of modelling capabilities.
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles[1]. In particular, beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to publish results data in open access databases and/or as annexes to publications.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Health authorities and insurers adopt new payment models for health technologies, including pharmaceuticals.
Health industries anticipate better the marketing conditions for innovative health technologies. Patients and health care providers have faster access to innovative health technologies.
Health authorities, insurers and health care providers have affordable innovative health technologies both on short and longer terms.
Scope:
Applicants are requested to propose new value-based pricing and reimbursement models that can help ensure equitable access to effective, efficient, affordable, and sustainable health technologies, including medicines, while supporting innovation and industrial competitiveness. The research should tackle the issue globally and be based on a multidisciplinary approach combining economic science, political science and sociology. The proposals should not be limited to the study of cost-effectiveness analyses and thresholds in decision-making. They should also address long term intended and unintended consequences of pricing and reimbursement decisions. Moreover, they should consider the potential limitation of no-coverage decision for products with high budgetary impact. Applicant consortia should include regulators and public entities that are in charge of attributing value tags to health technologies, negotiating with health technology manufacturers and/or reimbursing medical costs. Differences between public and private sectors could be considered, as appropriate. Proposals should also consider citizens engagement and dialogue, for seeking wider input and support, and could encourage other social innovation approaches.
Applicants should propose activities in all of the following areas:
Affordability of health innovations.
Variety of pricing/payment schemes in the EU.
Cost-effectiveness and budget impact (including life-time indirect medical costs).
Impact of payment schemes (e.g. pay-for-performance/multi-annual instalments) on long-term competition in health technology markets, in particular the pharmaceutical market.
Potential influence of post-launch evidence-generation plans agreed with regulators and downstream decision makers (HTAs, payers) on the payment models.
Transparent and comprehensive assessment of technology and medicine development costs, taking into account public investments and incremental character of some innovations (e.g. new indications).
Development, integration and harmonisation of tools that allow for validation and revision of clinical evidence and cost-effectiveness, and long-term financial planning for effective and transparent decision-making.
New methods for definition of cost-effectiveness thresholds, integration of greener production and environmental impact, rational applications in real world contexts, comparative analysis of influence in decision-making and influence in the formulation of prices of technologies.
Potential equity issues derived by payment models and the measures for their mitigation.

","21 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 2 ‘Living and working in a health-promoting environment’. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
EU and national public authorities regularly use economic and health modelling in policy impact assessments and policy evaluation, and promote the use of these to other stakeholders;
Stakeholders agree on the most relevant population health and quality of life metrics, including DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years) or QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life Years)[1], and economic metrics;
The stakeholder community follows common guidelines and methodologies for integrative socio-economic assessments and cost-benefit analysis of environmental pollution in Europe.
Scope:
Policy-makers face challenges when devising pollution mitigation measures and having to assess the health costs emerging from life-long exposures to environmental stressors or the benefits from clean environments. Deaths and disabilities resulting from pollution carry a quantifiable economic cost to society, but there are significant uncertainties in the cost estimates methodologies. There is also paucity of data to evaluate the economic benefits of clean environments.
Impact Pathway Analysis[2] and Health Impact Assessment (HIA)[3] are methodologies, which can be useful in linking scientific knowledge with environmental economics for informing policy action in diverse sectors such as transport, energy, chemicals, occupational health etc.
Proposed research activities should mainly aim to improve the calculation of the socio-economic costs (and/or benefits) of health impacts during the life-course associated to environmental stressors, or combinations of these, advance methodological approaches and foster their acceptance as common good practice.
Proposals should consider all of the following activities:
Systematic review and exploitation of latest evidence of exposure-response functions and causation resulting from published medical and scientific research accumulated data from the past 10-20 years, including results published based on EU-funded research projects;
Identification of data gaps as regards environment and health risk factors and health-related tangible and intangible costs and recommendations on priorities for new data collections;
Advancement of methodological rigor and consistency in accounting for morbidity and mortality, disabilities, linking valuation of statistical life and/or life-years with quality adjustments within a unified framework, based on the most recent data available and adapted to the needs and circumstances in Europe;
Application of experimental approaches addressing the potential link of quality of life and the burden of disease indicators with more integrative impact indicators (e.g. reflecting subjective well-being, health, work-life balance, education, housing, etc.) and identification of how national contexts can impact on health-related costs of the same environmental and occupational exposure;
Enhancement of the understanding of the role of discounting and other methods for weighing present and future costs and benefits;
Development of innovative tools, methods and models, and associated guidelines for health impact assessments and related cost-benefit analysis;
Consultation of experts and stakeholders on tools, models, methods and assessments developed towards a shared agreement of these;
Development of case studies involving public authorities comparing the costs of action and non-action in at least three EU or associated countries;
Delivery of FAIR[4] data and a user-friendly access to an open knowledge base including results, methodologies and data appropriate for use in public policies and budget allocations.
Projects could consider the involvement of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in the field of health impacts of environmental stressors.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.
Whenever appropriate, the use of environmental data and products coming from the Copernicus[5] programme, specifically the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), is encouraged.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
The scientific and clinical communities use the increased knowledge on pathogens and better understanding of the immune system’s role in infectious diseases to develop vaccines with improved efficacy.
Vaccine manufacturers use more innovative and sustainable manufacturing technologies and improved GMP manufacturing know-how for producing the next generation of vaccines.
A diversified portfolio of vaccine candidates ready for testing in clinical trials help policy makers and funders to make informed decisions about support to vaccine development.
New innovative and improved design of preclinical/clinical studies that match the features of the next generation of vaccines is available for clinical community and regulators, and will shorten vaccine development time.
Scope:
Infectious diseases, including antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections, remain a major threat to health and health security in the EU and globally. The availability of more effective, accessible and affordable vaccines would provide the most cost-effective preventive measure against the health threat of epidemics and AMR pathogens. Vaccines against diseases, such as AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, neglected tropical diseases, hepatitis C and water-borne diseases are essential to achieve the WHO targets to control the spread of infectious diseases. The first generation of vaccines against some of the pathogens have proven to be suboptimal and not effective enough to protect the population. Many viruses of pandemic potential are variable in their surface antigen composition, and novel technologies are required to develop efficient vaccines against each new variant efficiently and in a short timeframe. To ensure that more effective, accessible and affordable vaccines against all major infectious diseases become a reality, it is essential to sustain a diverse and modernised vaccine development pipeline.
Proposals should aim to diversify and accelerate the global vaccine research and development pipeline, and to strengthen the current leading role of the EU in vaccine research and development. Proposals should cover those pathogens, which still lack vaccines of sufficient efficacy, but where earlier efforts have already produced promising vaccine candidates.
The proposals should address several of the following areas:
Innovation and integration of expertise and capabilities, including alignment of preclinical and clinical models, biomarker studies and new vaccine approaches from discovery to late stage development, from bench-based research to clinical development of promising preventive candidates.
Application of iterative processes (including cross-learning, back-translation steps, integrative analysis of data) to allow exploitation and integration of novel findings between clinical, preclinical and discovery research and development.
Deciphering mechanisms of protection of candidates, new approaches to antigen discovery and immunogen engineering, reverse vaccinology, evaluation of vaccines in novel platforms and technologies, novel adjuvants, innovative vaccine manufacturing approaches, relevant animal models, evaluation of alternative vaccine delivery routes.
Effective, evidence-based decision-making for progression of vaccine candidates in the pipeline based on transparent and objective portfolio management. Regulatory requirements be considered. Sex, gender, age and socio-economic factors should be taken into account.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
Researchers and developers make the best use of the state-of-the-art knowledge and resources for a fast and effective development of new therapies for rare diseases.
Researchers and developers increase the development success rate of therapies for rare diseases by employing robust preclinical models, methods, technologies, validated biomarkers, reliable patient reported outcomes and/or innovative clinical trials designs.
Developers and regulators move faster towards market approval of new therapies for rare diseases (with currently no approved treatment option) due to an increased number of interventions successfully tested in late stages of clinical development.
Healthcare professionals and people living with a rare disease get access to new therapeutic interventions and/or orphan medicinal products.
Scope:
Despite the considerable amount of knowledge that has been accumulated and the new orphan medicines developed in recent years, the number of available therapies for rare diseases remains low, as fewer than 6% of rare diseases have an approved treatment option.
The joint evaluation[1]of the regulations on orphan medicinal products and paediatric medicines concluded that those regulations have boosted the development for new therapies for rare diseases but have not yet adequately managed to direct research and innovation in areas of greatest unmet medical need. Actually, there is an urgent unmet medical need for the development of therapies for rare diseases, where there is still no approved therapeutic option available.
Therefore, proposals should aim to develop therapies for rare diseases with no approved therapeutic option. Proposals should focus on group(s) of rare diseases with commonalities, such as shared biological features, possibly within the same and/or across different medical areas within the rare diseases landscape[2]. Thus, proposals should not address a single disease only (for example with an Orphacode representing a single disease).
The therapies to be developed may include a broad family of therapeutic interventions such as small molecule(s), advanced therapy medicinal products, repurposing of existing medicinal products, including non-pharmacological interventions and/or their combinations, as relevant. Sex and gender aspects should be considered, where relevant. To ensure that the needs of people living with a rare disease are adequately addressed, the involvement of patient representatives in all phases of the research and development process is strongly encouraged. Rare infectious diseases and rare cancers are excluded from this topic and will not be considered.
The topic will support proposals covering several different stages in the continuum of the innovation pathway (i.e. translational, preclinical, clinical research, validation in the clinical and/or real-world setting etc.), as relevant. SME(s) participation is encouraged with the aim to strengthen the scientific and technological basis of SME(s) and valorise their innovations for the benefit of people living with a rare disease.
The proposals should address most of the following research activities:
Establish multidisciplinary collaborations between all relevant stakeholders by integrating disciplines, technological developments and existing knowledge. Integrate harmonised data from multiple sources (i.e. natural history studies/clinical trials, multi-omics, medical imaging, registries etc.) by utilising data analytics and/or other suitable methods, with the aim to understand the pathophysiology/heterogeneity of the rare diseases concerned and to identify therapeutically actionable mechanisms.
Develop and utilise relevant preclinical models and/or innovative tools/technologies to: verify molecular/cellular pathways/genes that can be therapeutically targeted, increase the confidence in the targets selection and/or perform toxicity studies. When using disease models the applicants should describe how well the model replicates the pathology or the human condition.
Develop and/or execute innovative clinical trials designs for small populations and novel approaches to assess and monitor the safety and efficacy of the proposed interventions. Such approaches may include but are not limited to: biomarkers defining robust surrogate and clinical endpoints; artificial intelligence tools/medical devices/biosensors/ companion/ complementary diagnostics for defining reliable patient reported outcomes; modelling and simulation and in-silico trials methodologies.
Carry out preclinical proof-of-concept (PoC) studies and/or multinational interventional clinical studies[3] to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic interventions under study. Preclinical PoC studies should include late-stage preclinical studies (i.e. toxicological properties, adverse effects etc.). Clinical studies may cover all necessary development stages. Applicants should propose a clear exploitation pathway through the different necessary steps (research, manufacturing, regulatory approvals and licensing, IP management etc.) in order to accelerate marketing authorisation and uptake by the health systems.
Proposals should involve group(s) of rare diseases (i.e. a rare disease being individually defined in the European Union as affecting not more than five in 10.000 persons). Proposals that plan to run clinical trials should demonstrate that they have already taken into account scientific advice[4] or protocol assistance from EMA. In particular, proposals planning the clinical development of orphan medicinal products should demonstrate that they have been granted approval for an orphan designation at the latest on the date of the call deadline.
Proposals should adhere to the FAIR[5] data principles and take stock, wherever relevant, of data standards, harmonisation guidelines and good practices for data sharing/access developed by existing European health research infrastructures (i.e. ESFRI infrastructures[6]). Proposals should take stock, where relevant, of the FAIR guidance, of good practices for analytical methods and preclinical models and of good exploitation strategies for the translation of research results into high impact interventions, developed by the European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases[7] (EJP RD) and other relevant EU-funded projects. Whenever the proposed data sources or fields of application include genomics, the proposals should take into account, where relevant, the data standards, and legal, ethical and technical interoperability requirements and guidelines agreed within the 1+ Million Genomes initiative[8]. Data-intensive proposals, particularly those using data from patient registries, could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) and take stock of the tools and services provided by the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform), including the adoption, where relevant, of the European standards such as the ""set of common data elements”[9]. In addition, synergies should be sought with the European Reference Networks[10], where relevant.
Projects funded under this topic will contribute towards the goals of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) that supports the development of 1000 new therapies for rare diseases by 2027 and may take stock of the IRDiRC Orphan Drug Development Guidebook[11], where relevant.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
The scientific and clinical communities make effective use of the pre-clinical validation of new immunotherapies for high burden diseases or disorders with unmet medical needs.
The scientific and clinical communities have access to new knowledge allowing for a better understanding of the mode of action of the next generation of immunotherapies and/or combinatorial treatments, which enables further development and optimisation of treatments.
The scientific and clinical communities have access to and use new personalized models (in vitro and in vivo) for high burden diseases or disorders as well as protocols for the next generation of immunotherapies.
Health care professionals have access to and use new evidence-based safety and efficacy guidelines for immunotherapies. Proof-of-clinical concept, when applicable, as single or combinatorial treatment, should be compared to existing approaches.
Scope:
Immunotherapy is defined as a treatment able to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune (defence) system to fight infection, disease or disorder. It has proved to be a valuable medical treatment notably when preventive interventions are not available. Passive and active immunotherapies (such as antibody-based, RNA-based and cell-based therapies, respectively) are covered by this topic, which is aiming at the pre-clinical to first-in human development of next generation immunotherapies for unmet needs.
Proposals should build on existing knowledge in the field, when available, in order to save time and to avoid spilling resources, and could build on the knowledge of the interaction between the immune system (innate and adaptive arms) and the microbiota, or take advantage of key enabling technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing, imaging, 5G, internet of things, artificial intelligence and existing databases.
The next generation of immunotherapies are needed in order to improve and diversify the capabilities of health care for several communicable and non-communicable diseases[1] that cannot be effectively tackled with the currently available treatments.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following research gaps for the development of the next generation of effective and safe immunotherapies:
Preclinical development and study of new immunotherapeutic agents in vitro and in relevant animal model(s) of the disease(s). This includes understanding of the therapy’s agent(s) mode of action, its toxicity, the development of related potency assay(s), and its/their validation in vitro and in vivo. A robust regulatory and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) strategy should be in place at the start of the proposal.
Off-the-shelf therapies, including the cell-based therapies, will be considered as assets during the evaluation.
Proposals could include proof-of-concept (PoC)/first-in-human studies for testing the new therapies, with a clear regulatory and clinical pathway [2] and should address as appropriate the therapy-related potential for adverse side effects. PoC and clinical studies in humans should take sex, gender, age and socio-economic factors into account, where relevant. Phase II studies or later phase trials will not be supported.
Development of a standardised framework for assays and data usage to enable a robust assessment of the safety and efficacy.
In case treatments are already available for the proposed targeted disease(s), a justification of the need for development of a new immunotherapy treatment is requested.
The proposed action should include a pathway of the necessary steps to ensure sustainable therapeutic agent production (considering intellectual property management if relevant) and uptake by health systems and rapid access to patients.
Projects may consider the use of the nanobiotechnology infrastructure platform of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, in particular for the accurate physicochemical characterization of therapeutic proteins and antibodies.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 4, notably “Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care”, “A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats” and “High-quality digital services for all”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Researchers across European countries and regions are engaged in enhanced collaborative research on transforming health and care systems;
Health and care authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use the research results to develop evidence-based strategies and policies on transforming health care systems and learn from good practices of European countries and regions;
Health and care providers and professionals implement innovative ways of delivering care and maintaining population health;
Health and care authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders plan and carry out efficient investments in health and care systems at national/regional level to use innovative solutions and care models;
An increased number of innovators and stronger local/regional ecosystems of stakeholders are in place and facilitate uptake of successful innovations for health and care;
Citizens and health and care professionals have increased digital and health literacy;
Countries cooperate better and use context-specific knowledge and evidence to make their health and care systems more resilient with respect to upcoming needs and crises.
Scope:
For many reasons (demographic changes, technological progress, fiscal constraints, public health emergencies etc.) the European health and care systems are expected to be subject to severe stress. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted existing structural weaknesses in health and care systems, and emphasised areas where not enough effort, planning and resources had been directed to. In addition, rapid technological and societal evolutions call for urgent responses to increasing demands and expectations from citizens. There is a need to accelerate the transition towards more efficient, sustainable, resilient, innovative and accessible health and care systems in Europe. To this end, the creation of a research and innovation (R&I) partnership with a focus on health and care systems’ transformation represents a unique strategic opportunity to bring together stakeholders, create synergies, coordinate R&I actions, facilitate the digitization of health and care services and support the transformation of health and care systems with innovative solutions driven by knowledge and evidence. The partnership should build on knowledge gained from initiatives taken under Horizon 2020 (TO-REACH, Active and Assisted Living programme (AAL), Joint Programming Initiative More Years, Better, Lives (JPI MYBL), European Innovation partnership (EIP-AHA), ICPerMed, etc.). In order to increase the likelihood of successful system transformation, the partnership will facilitate exchange of information and good practices among countries, provide robust guidance and tools, network institutional stakeholders and involve regional ecosystems. It will stimulate service, policy and organisational innovations, as well as the integration of biomedical and technological innovations for the benefit of the European citizens and the European industry. Development of new products is beyond the scope of this Partnership. By laying the ground for the transformation of the health and care systems, the partnership will contribute to the transition of Europe to a more sustainable development and address emerging threats raised by environmental changes and globalisation.
The partnership should bring together a broad range of actors with a common vision of future health and care systems. Through the objectives of Horizon Europe, the partnership should contribute to achieving the following European Commission priorities:
Promoting our European way of life
An economy that works for people
A Europe fit for the digital age
A European green deal
The partnership will contribute to priorities of the “Communication on effective, accessible and resilient health systems” (COM(2014) 215 final), the “Communication on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market; empowering citizens and building a healthier society” (COM(2018) 233 final) and support the objectives of the Commission proposal for the new EU4Health Programme (COM(2020) 405 final).
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, health and care institutions, innovators, policy makers), to create a critical mass of resources and to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), the partnership will address the following objectives:
Supporting multidisciplinary R&I to fill knowledge gaps, produce evidence and develop guidance and tools in priority areas for the transformation of health and care systems,
Supporting the interdisciplinary development of service, policy and organisational innovations for health and care systems,
Strengthening the R&I community in the field of health and care systems,
Improving the capability of health and care actors to take up innovative solutions,
Gathering stakeholders to develop the ecosystems needed for a swift uptake of innovations by health and care systems.
The European Partnership on transforming health and care systems[1] should be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from research to coordination and networking activities, including training, demonstration, piloting and dissemination activities, to be structured along the following main building blocks:
Joint implementation of the SRIA;
Joint annual calls for R&I activities, applied R&I, pilots, twinning projects;
Joint annual calls for experimental development and innovation funding, co-creation, involvement of end-users, new concepts of care and innovative solutions for supporting health according to WHO definition; development of ecosystems, business models;
Capacity building activities;
Activities to increase health and digital literacy among citizens and health care practitioners;
Flanking measures.
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to those countries wanting to join. It should include the following actors:
Ministries in charge of R&I policy, as well as national and regional R&I and technology funding agencies and foundations;
Ministries in charge of health and care policy, as well as national and regional health and care authorities, organisations and providers.
The Partnership may also encourage engagement with other relevant Ministries and will involve other key actors from civil society and end-users, research and innovation community, innovation owners, health and care systems owners/organisers and health and care agencies.
The Partnership’s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should leave sufficient space for involving the key stakeholders, including but not limited to R&I community, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care organisations, and innovation owners.
Financial commitments and in-kind contributions are expected to be provided for the governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts for national coordination.
To encourage national coordination and avoid an excess of grant signatories it is recommended to limit their number to two per country. However, in duly justified cases this number could differ, including for countries with decentralised administration to allow for participation of regional authorities in charge of R&I policy and health and care policy.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other Horizon Europe partnerships (institutionalized and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on ‘Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe’[2] as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health, DEP, ESF+, ERDF, InvestEU, RRF and TSI.
The Partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data[3].
Although this Partnership will focus on the transformation of European health and care systems, cooperation with international organisations, and non-European institutions and experts may be considered. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives. The EUR 60 000 threshold provided for in Article 204(a) of the Financial Regulation No 2018/1046[4] does not apply.
The expected duration of the partnership is seven years.
Horizon Europe contribution will be limited to a maximum of 30% of the total eligible costs of the action with a maximum of EUR 100 million of EU contribution

Deploy easy to program advanced control systems capable of intelligent handling of complex products in terms of shape, size, material and stiffness;
Increase productivity by enabling fast and accurate movement of work pieces through the production line, ensuring just-in-time delivery and reducing downtime.
Scope:
The global trends towards product customization have increased production complexity. To maintain global leadership and competitiveness of European manufacturing industry, there is a strong need for efficient, flexible, reconfigurable and data-driven agile factories. The recent pandemic crisis highlighted even further the need of manufacturing lines that can switch production within a matter of hours.
Products and component handling is an integral part of the manufacturing industry and its optimization increases productivity while minimizing production costs and time. However, the increasing complexity and customization of products coupled to the paradigm shift towards circular economy requires new assembly and disassembly lines able to handle a high variety of work pieces which might be available as 3D models or just as physical artefacts. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for innovative smart automated handling systems.
Multidisciplinary research activities should include SSH and cover:
Development of innovative, efficient and low consumption systems for storage, retrieval, conveying and pick-and-place using a multi-disciplinary approach combining technologies such as collaborative/autonomous assembly and logistics, smart conveyor belts, advanced robotics, lightweight, flexible and versatile grippers, IoT, integrated physical and biochemical sensors (e.g. mechanical, magnetic, optical, electrochemical), image processing, simulation, modelling, data acquisition, data storage/sharing, data interoperability, data analytics, automated planning and machine learning;
Development of advanced and robust handling devices and systems, for efficient manipulation and manufacturing process execution. Integrate advanced control of individual handling devices exploiting advances in AI;
Achieve a high degree of flexibility and reconfigurability by ensuring interoperability and user-friendliness of both hardware and software;
The solutions proposed should be able to handle autonomously different objects with a significant variety of shape, size and material properties;
Demonstrate benefits for workers by reducing their involvement in unsafe and unhealthy tasks, improving their working conditions and increasing trust and acceptance towards technology;
Deploy innovative technologies in at least three manufacturing lines targeting different manufacturing processes and sectors, e.g. food & beverage preparation and packaging, metalworking, product assembly, textile processing and production, etc.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Develop more efficient manufacturing processes to increase market share increase for products with functional surfaces that contribute to competitiveness and a transition to green and sustainable production flows;
Significant reduction of the environmental footprint for surface treatments;
Uptake of treatment technologies in applications for a sustainable society, targeting reductions in energy use and environmental footprint.
Scope:
Surface treatments are an integral part of any manufacturing process. Surface treatments include many disciplines, such as painting/coating/printing (spray, powder, dip coating, inkjet etc.), plating/implantation (electroplating, vacuum plating/coating, etc.), thermal treatments (annealing, thermo-chemical processes, etc.), laser-based treatments (annealing, texturing, etc.), additive manufacturing, micro manufacturing (micro electrical discharge machining, micro milling, etc.) chemical and electrochemical treatments (anodizing, electropolishing, chemical deposition, etc.), biochemical treatments, etching (wet etching, plasma/dry etching, also for texturing).
While the integration of these treatment technologies into a manufacturing line has been well reported, the technologies as such need to be adapted for each particular profile. In addition, with progressively more complex and customised requirements on shape, material and functionality, the demands on efficient and flexible surface treatments are increasing. In a transition towards a sustainable production, with a substantially lower environmental footprint, the demands are even higher.
The projects under this topic should address the following:
Develop new surface treatments specifically targeting and enabling end-products with the purpose of reducing the end-products’ energy usage and/or environmental footprint. This may include co-design of product geometry and surface properties;
Use of innovative production technologies for further functional integration and miniaturisation in order to reduce environmental footprints and resource use of products;
Integrate the new surface treatments in a manufacturing line for profiles with complex shape or multimaterial content, with clear metrics on its efficiency during operation;
Develop new business models and strategies for the uptake of these new technologies and with clear objectives on how to expand the uptake to other sectors and other applications.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Making European manufacturing companies, especially SMEs and small mid-caps, more sustainable and resilient through the best use of digital technologies and upskilling of personnel;
Making jobs of humans working in the manufacturing sector safer and more attractive for a diverse population of workers;
Increasing innovation capacity, agility and productivity of the manufacturing sector, in particular for SMEs and mid-caps;
Increasing the competitiveness of SMEs and mid-caps by reducing the entry barriers to the use of advanced digital technologies, and transferring innovative solutions into the wider manufacturing community.
Scope:
ICT Innovation for Manufacturing SMEs (I4MS) aims to support manufacturing SMEs and mid-caps in adopting the latest innovative digital technologies for their business operations. I4MS2 builds on I4MS and addresses more significantly a sustainable and resilient production.
The pandemic and economic crises demonstrated the key role of digital technologies in responding quickly to external changes. Digitalisation improves resilience, agility and competitiveness, and enables cost-efficient production in Europe. It will also support a radical reduction of the environmental footprint of the sector. In this context, experimentation with innovative and secure digital technologies in their production processes, products and business models guided notably by competence centres specialised in the technologies mentioned below will enhance manufacturing companies to successfully manage the twin digital and green transformation of the coming years.
I4MS2 calls for Innovation Action projects that will support European SMEs and mid-caps to innovate and make more sustainable their products, production processes and business models through experimentation and testing. At least 50% of the budget should be allocated to SMEs and mid-caps to participate in the experiments. The proposals may include financial support to third parties to finance SMEs and mid-caps. Proposals should describe their complementarity to existing initiatives, namely the network of European Digital Innovation Hubs, which is supported through the Digital Europe Programme. They should also indicate how they will collaborate with European Digital Innovation Hubs.
Priority should be given to technologies that can:
Improve the sustainability of processes and products; significantly reduce or reuse waste and lower the energy and carbon footprint;
Make industrial processes more agile, secure and resilient to future changes;
Make manufacturing jobs more attractive for humans, whichever the age, gender or social and cultural background, through better human-machine interfaces and more intuitive interaction with digital tools;
The following technology areas should be addressed in proposals:
Artificial Intelligence applied to manufacturing, with a specific focus of AI applications at the edge;
Cybersecure Industrial Internet of Things enabling trustworthy sharing of industrial data and value creation, to achieve further flexibility and agility of supply chains;
Advanced interfaces and collaboration within smart working environments such as collaborative robots.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Significant advance in modular technologies for flexible manufacturing operations, which respond to disrupted supply chains, or rapid changes in customer and societal demands;
Transition of modular technology to sustainable production for varying batch sizes, including single lots, with a clear integration of control and decision-making strategies at different levels and throughout the supply chain;
Improved understanding among industrial users, including SMEs, of how to organise and control reconfigurable manufacturing systems built from modules with defined interfaces, including quality assessments, environmental impact, energy use, end-user involvement and business models.
Scope:
Modularity of a production system is crucial for flexibility and to allow for varying the production according to needs and circumstances by introducing, changing, and removing different process steps. While the concept of modularity is not new, there is still a vast range of production steps that cannot be considered modular, and the ones that can be considered as such are not necessarily suitable for current demands nor to be considered as a part of sustainable production regimes.
The projects under this topic need to address the following aspects:
Propose and develop new production modules that cover processes that are not currently readily available on the market and go beyond the current state of the art with a clear alignment of customer and workers’ needs including taking into consideration biases and gender dimension;
Create interfaces based on open-source protocols that allow for easily integration of modules in existing lines and with other modules or production elements;
Create industrial strategies on how to use modularity, including its related service models, to reduce energy consumption and environmental footprint, and demonstrate these in a relevant environment;
Develop business models that demonstrate the potential of the modular technologies to be transferred from one specific manufacturing sector to several others;
Support training and knowledge transfer to relevant parts of the workforce.

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Support climate policies through an enhanced understanding of existing and emerging carbon dioxide removal options in terms of their technical readiness, key requirements (land and other resource needs, geographical and geological constraints, primary energy needs, etc.), short- and long-term sequestration potential, permanence, impacts (environmental, social, health, resource depletion, etc.) including potential co-benefits.
Support climate models and integrated assessment models through an improved parametrisation of these technologies and solutions, allowing their better integration into pathways and strategies and broadening the carbon dioxide removal technology options that can be numerically modelled.
A harmonised, comprehensive and transparent methodology for the characterisation and comparison of such technologies and the barriers to their deployment, which can facilitate public discourse on their role and impacts.
Gain better insight into the extended, system-level impacts of these technologies by considering ripple effects (e.g. extended impacts, land benefits foregone, opportunity costs, and rebound effects).
Develop abatement cost estimates in function of time profile as well as factors like scale of deployment, key input factors (e.g., land/sea space, energy, reservoirs).
Exploration and demonstration of business/ policy/ MRV (Monitoring, reporting and verification) frameworks for CDR uptake at scale, ranging from plant level to incorporation of CDR in international MRV and accounting (for example in the case of bioenergy trade).
Scope:
Projects under this topic should identify an extended range of nature-based and technical CDR methods, analyse and characterise them in a consistent and transparent assessment framework. In this way, projects should:
Deliver realistic estimates of each approach’s potential scale, cost, and effectiveness: on the basis of factors such as technical readiness, key land and other resource needs, geographical and geological constraints, primary energy needs (and associated impacts, including emissions), short- and long-term sequestration potential (including risk of non-permanence), key impacts (environmental, social, health, resource depletion, etc.) and risks.
Allow the better parametrisation of integrated assessment models with respect to removals as well a better design of forward-looking policies. Develop abatement cost estimates in function of time profile as well variables like scale of deployment and key input factors.
Explore efficient incentive and governance frameworks to facilitate CDR uptake at scale, including social acceptance, ethical and regulatory considerations, as well as identifying major issues and options for establishing MRV and accounting systems associated with CDR in general and specific technologies where applicable.
Analysis under this action should be based on practical experiences (in particular with a range of land-based projects), existing pilot and experimental projects, technical and theoretical analysis and review, including system-level impacts by considering ripple effects through consequential analysis, including land benefits foregone, opportunity costs and rebound effects, key barriers to deployment and governance challenges.

Increase participation of energy consumers in demand side flexibility markets by reducing entry barriers and transaction cost, in particular in relation to data exchange and market access.
Provide viable interoperable solutions and products, available to all levels of the grid including within the home, which makes it simple to increase flexibility in energy consumption and have a positive impact in balancing demand/response with an increasing share of renewable energy sources.
Create a vibrant cross-sector ecosystem, successfully mobilising demand-response and demonstrating opportunities for new services provided by SMEs and start-ups.
Create sustainable marketplaces based on a comprehensive catalogue of energy smart appliances (home appliances including EV charging and distributed energy storage), services and hardware/software solutions compliant with a set of standards for Minimum Interoperability.
Demonstrate the potential for a sustainable up-take (coordinated across all projects from the call) based on components and solutions piloted in real life.
Scope:
Promote the adoption and usage of connected interoperable energy smart home appliances (including the EV charging and home storage) and solutions in order to accelerate the deployment of demand-side flexibility services, reduce the entry barrier and facilitate replication.
Identify a set of open standards for Minimum Interoperability based on the results of multiple research and innovation projects and existing technological developments as well as already available open standards and/or open source solutions to enable energy smart appliances and solutions to participate in demand side flexibility.
Provide new business models supported by innovative interoperable solutions enabled by connecting systems from different sectors.
Test interoperable services/solutions based on a reference architecture and minimum interoperability mechanisms that can enable flexibility.
The solutions initially developed in a pilot in one country will have to be tested, in real life, in at least two other countries, with different energy constraints, by different entities. The overall target is replication in as many Member States/Associated Countries as possible.
Create and populate a commonly agreed catalogue of energy smart home appliances (including EV charging and storage), services and hardware/software solutions compliant to a set of standards for Minimum Interoperability.
The call is open to all stakeholders. For instance, utilities, ESCO/aggregators, appliances manufacturers, energy cooperatives, retailers owning buildings (heating/cooling) in many cities, office building that in their parkings offer eV chargers, water treatment plants, public buildings, schools, ICT companies, system integrators, Data Centre operators, EV manufacturers, storage providers, industry and other relevant stakeholders with a role in the energy flexibility market.
The projects should support the proliferation of innovative energy and energy services markets building on interoperable solutions that can be tailored easily to the type or need of users. Therefore the projects should take into account the social and behavioural dimensions of consumer’s participation and to get the acceptance of different energy technologies.
The solutions are expected to adapt digital technologies to the specificities and requirements of the energy system (Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, 5G, cloud/edge computing, Internet of Things ...).

Successful, safe and economic demonstration of integrated-chain CCUS from relevant industrial sources will pave the way for subsequent first-of-a-kind industrial projects. The scale of the proposals should permit obtaining relevant data and experience required so that up-scaling to a first-of-a-kind plant can be envisaged as a next step.
The impact of projects under this call will be determined by the extent to which the results will be extended to be used in further industrial facilities. In addition, it is important to demonstrate how the captured CO2 will be utilised and/or stored in a sustainable way. Projects carried out in areas with a sufficient concentration of CO2 emitting industries are considered prime sites for hub and cluster developments, and are expected to generate the highest impact on full-scale deployment of the results.
Scope:
CCUS is one of the key promising technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions in the carbon intensive industry and the only pathway for very stringent GHG emission reductions from those industries that generate CO2 as part of their production processes. Relevant industrial sectors in which inclusion of CCUS could contribute to reaching climate neutrality are for example steel, iron and cement making, oil refining, gas processing, hydrogen production, sustainable biofuel production and waste-to-energy plants. However, CCUS in industrial applications faces significant challenges due to its high cost and the fierce international competition in the sectors concerned. These sectors currently account for up to 20% of global CO2 emissions.
The focus of this topic lies in demonstrating the integrated chain of mature CO2 capture technologies in industrial facilities with the perspective of geological storage and/or use. Based on a high TRL (7 – 8) CO2 capture project a detailed plan on how to use the results, i.e. the subsequent transport, utilisation and/or underground storage of the captured CO2 should be developed. Important aspects to address are of technical (e.g. the optimised integration of capture plant with industrial processes; flexibility, scalability; CO2 purity), safety (e.g. during transportation and storage), financial (e.g. cost of capture; cost of integration) and strategic nature (e.g. business models; operation and logistics of industrial clusters and networks). The project should identify a detailed set of operational, environmental, technical and economic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to allow monitoring and assessing the progress achieved by the project.
Technology development has to be balanced by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations. Relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) will be identified in the proposal, and involved in deliberative activities, so as understand and address their concerns and needs. This will be analysed during the project using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities, in order to create awareness, gain feedback on societal impact and advancing society’s readiness for the proposed solutions. Projects should also explore the socio-economic and political barriers to acceptance and awareness with a view to regulatory or policy initiatives and include aspects of circularity and best use of resources. Successful projects will be encouraged to join the EU CCUS knowledge sharing project network.

Project results are expected to contribute to most of the following expected outcomes:
Demonstrate in real life interactive communication and support tools to engage citizens in the energy transition and to support them throughout the process of creating, constituting and developing an energy community, that are developed and fine-tuned based on field-tests;
Engagement of distributed active consumers and energy communities at broad scale, including through innovative incentive mechanisms;
Enabled new market roles and market participants;
Enabled automated participation;
Residential and SME related Demand Response contributing to increased level of flexibility and to the development of new flexibility products;
Identified drivers and rules beyond marginal pricing which can steer the transactions within the energy communities;
Developing mechanisms to support the creation, growth and capacity building of energy communities.
Scope:
The provisions of the Clean Energy Package have paved the way for a new, more active role of prosumers and energy communities in the electricity market. Innovative tools and tailored solutions should be developed and tested in order to fully enable new type of interactions between citizens as consumers, prosumers and (members of) energy communities and foster participation in energy (in particular electricity) markets.
To this aim, projects should link citizens, technologies, regulation and markets together.
Tools should be developed to support demonstration of the energy community paradigm shift within the mentioned context using suitable digital platforms for putting the citizens in direct contact with each other, suppliers, aggregators and other involved market stakeholders and to increase prosumers’ satisfaction and participation.
Dedicated demonstrations should be set to demonstrate the use of these interactive tools to contribute to real-time optimization of Distributed Energy Resources and the facilitation of investment decisions at household or community level in RES or demand response.
To get the acceptance of different energy technologies in civil society, these demonstrations should be built on SSH approach to take into account the social and behavioural dimension at the stage of their design, also considering safety issues of electrical systems.
As a result, these demonstrations are expected to aim to increase the understanding of consumer’s behaviour (e.g. by understanding how they are providing demand side flexibility as close as possible to real-time). They should also aim to create innovative tools and tailored solutions to empower prosumers, to help them to realise energy communities and finally pave the way for the energy transition.
With these new insights the projects are expected to adapt the solution, test it again and compare the outcome of both iterations.
The tested solutions should be able to reconciling the top-down market developments with the bottom-up changes in the market arrangement and participation.
Solutions are expected to be as replicable as possible and to be demonstrated in a variety of geographical locations in different Member States/Associated Countries representing very different social and economic situations. In addition, regulatory / administrative barriers and possible solutions should be assessed as part of the projects.
To do so, projects are expected to design, develop and test incentives for market participants to react to system conditions according to location and time, while at the same time considering maximization of their economic benefit.
Projects should develop the entire functional chain from data collection and elaboration, to local flexibility needs and user-centric compensation enabling the active participation of prosumers.
Projects should take into account related ongoing activities under H2020 and Horizon Europe and are expected to contribute to relevant BRIDGE[1] activities.

Project results are expected to contribute to all] of the following expected outcomes:
A new generation of energy management systems implemented to provide the capability of a hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) to work as a conventional battery energy storage system with enhanced performance. Hybrid energy storage systems can concern distributed sources of storage, such as EV Batteries, Home Batteries, or connection with the Heat Pumps.
Agreeing in wide scope of stakeholders including EV community and other sources of storage (e.g. flexible heat pumps) on a common protocol that could connect different storage applications (Energy- Home management system, heat pumps, EVs).
Validation of user acceptance, and demonstrating concepts that ensure privacy, liability, security and trust in connected data spaces.
To encourage European citizens and businesses, especially SMEs to deploy storage, the ease of use and consequently interoperability are a must.
Scope:
The objective is to develop interoperable distributed storage technology to enable the seamless utilization and monetization of storage flexibility within a real life environment.
Pilots need to demonstrate innovative Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Hybrid Energy Storage Systems HESS solutions within the home, building, community and stand-alone and power grid connected together with TSO and/or DSO, including real-time data sharing and operation.
At least 2 pilots, with different use cases (overall covering both BESS and HESS systems), should present interoperable solutions involving different types of BESS.
The project(s) should facilitate HESS reaching a similar interoperability and Plug-and-Play capabilities of a BESS with extended performance by using virtualization techniques.
A new generation of hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) that can efficiently operate with the combined capacities of the individual energy storage systems (ESS) that conform it. Hybrid energy storage systems can concern distributed sources of storage, such as EV Batteries, Home Batteries, or connection with the Heat Pumps.
Real-time data sharing and operation should be ensured through aligning existing standards from the utility and ICT domains, across the devices and systems to enable innovative distributed storage services.
Deployment and adoption of IoT standards and platforms for distributed storage systems (stationary and electric vehicles) in Europe and development of cost-effective and sustainable European distributed storage ecosystems and related business models are expected. For example:
Access of third parties to the minimum necessary data to perform aggregation functions should be looked at: which type of data could be made available for 3rd parties.
Common solution between different stakeholder groups and different brands of devices should be looked at (for example storage from Heat Pumps requires coordination with several brands, so as to come up with a possible cross brands and cross sector solution).
HESS dimensioning methodology depending on the application and integration conditions, including the selection of different European manufacturers ESS to conform the HESS, connection architecture, and control. Aspects of competition to be considered (include different manufacturers).
Validation of the HESS integration in a real environment, demonstrating an efficient energy management, and the benefits of the combined capability of the individual ESS.
Framework for use of data that may be considered as personal data generated by natural persons under the GDPR.
Common architecture models (Smart Grids Architecture Model - SGAM[1]) and implementing standards (such as CEN-CENELEC, SAREF etc.) should be taken into account to ensure interoperability and compatibility.
Highest (semantic) interoperability should be reached for alluse cases of storage and cost of deployment of distributed storage is decreased.
The need for standard harmonization across industry sectors should be explored, along with legislation and demonstration of scalability and stimulation of spill-over effects, for example towards applications beyond road transport.
Feedback mechanisms from the users should be envisaged to allow adaptation and optimisation of the technological and business approach to the particular use case. For all actions, the consortia have to involve and/or engage relevant stakeholders and market actors who are committed to adopting/implementing the results.
The selected projects are expected to contribute to relevant BRIDGE[2] activities. Projects should take into account existing interoperability related work of previous and ongoing H2020 and HE research projects such as INTERCONNECT[3].
Collaboration and synergies with the co-programmed European Partnership 2Zero are also expected. Areas will concern interoperable aspects of integration of storage from the EVs, including research on minimum data to be made ready for the third parties (for purpose of storage), e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-03: System Approach for advanced Static Smart Charging: integration of EV with the infrastructure of the grid.
Similarly, collaboration and synergies are expected with European Partnership “Towards a competitive European industrial battery value chain for stationary applications and e-mobility”. Areas concern battery management system and operation data (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-06: Physics and data-based battery management for optimised battery utilisation), and complementarities where integration of battery systems into larger systems is not tackled (e.g. HORIZON-CL5-2022-D2-01-05: Next generation technologies for High-performance and safe-by-design battery systems for transport and mobile applications), will also be expected.

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Successful proposals will support policy makers in their efforts to develop sustainable pathways to replace fossil and carbon-intensive systems with circular bio-based systems at the EU and regional scale, in line with the 2030 climate targets and European Green Deal objectives. Project outcomes will contribute to foster European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence.
Projects results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
Policies are designed to enable the transition from linear fossil-based systems to circular bio-based systems, setting priorities.
Scope:
Abandoning the current linear fossil-based economy is a prerequisite for European Green Deal objectives and, in general, for preserving life on our planet. Biogenic resources are key means of mitigating climate change as they can strengthen natural and anthropogenic carbon sinks. Circular bio-based systems are part of the solution to achieving climate neutrality, where they replace carbon-intensive and fossil-based systems and are based on sustainably sourced biological resources. Policies must ensure that this transition from linear fossil-based to circular bio-based systems is sustainable and aims at i) climate change mitigation and adaptation; ii) increasing resource efficiency and circularity; iii) preserving and restoring natural resources, their ecosystem services and biodiversity; and i) ensuring a just transition for everyone. Policies and priorities should be comprehensive and underpinned by a critical assessment of the environmental/social/economic impacts of the current linear fossil-based economy. That assessment should help individuating policy priorities, as well.
To support designing policies to transition away from linear fossil-based systems towards sustainable circular bio-based ones, proposals should:
Consolidate knowledge on current trends in terms of the environmental, economic and social limits of a linear carbon-intensive and fossil-based economy. By limits, we mean technical and structural barriers and/or inability to reach local and global Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. SDGs, climate change mitigation targets, European Green Deal objectives). Cultural and social limits should also be considered, including barriers related to gender and age.
Develop new/improve existing methodologies to assess environmental/social/economic impacts of linearity vs circularity in the economy, including on waste production and disposal, non-renewable resources exploitation and loss, geographically (and socially) unbalanced distribution of resources and growth, biodiversity loss at global and local scale. The methodologies should consider circular economy indicators, methods and concepts developed or under development in existing initiatives, including Commission’s ongoing work on the circular economy monitoring framework and R&I activities.
Assess the environmental/social/economic impacts of the EU’s current linear fossil-based economy. This should include aspects related to the geographical distribution of oil origins and global trade, direct and indirect environmental impacts of fossil-based value chains on a life cycle base, including on, but not limited to, climate change, resource use including land, water and marine space, air/water/soil quality, ecosystems services and biodiversity. Costs arising from environmental and social impacts should be internalised in the economic impacts assessment.
Develop and compare multiple scenarios of transitioning from fossil-based to circular bio-based systems, modelling the replacement of the fossil-based activities, with a focus on the most carbon-intensive ones, with bio-based systems, including innovative solutions, at EU and global scale. Environmental/social/economic impacts of bio-based systems should be assessed with validated methodology, considering also the benefits of applying a circular approach to the bio-based systems. Biogenic carbon capture utilization (BCCU) solutions [1] for bio-based systems via nature-based solutions (e.g. in soils or long-term circular bio-based materials) should be part of the assessment. Scenarios should compare the impacts of fossil-based and bio-based solutions, and include social aspects and social innovation, especially at the socio-technical interfaces of innovative solutions.
Identify knowledge gaps in the assessment of the sustainability of the transition from fossil-based to circular bio-based systems and in the comparison between alternative scenarios as described under point d).
Identify priorities in the transition from fossil-based to circular bio-based systems, according to scenarios analysed in the project and develop guidelines and policy recommendations.
Proposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded within this topic.

Improved coherence in how the EU and associated countries contribute to CBD (e.g. SBSTTA/SBI) and to IPBES processes in cooperation with HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-20: Support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC.
Scope:
Research on biodiversity and nature-based solutions has made good progress in the last years, but must be stepped up to achieve targeted impacts on biodiversity-relevant policies. Global initiatives, in turn, should provide structured policy input into the research cycle. This is also key to guiding biodiversity governance, and to implement the EU Green Deal and international conventions.

","28 October 2021
","01 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Responding to the EU Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the farm to fork Strategy, a successful proposal will restore pollinator-habitats, support the development of pollinator-friendly policies, business models and market conditions, by helping to establish sustainable, productive, climate-neutral and resilient farming systems by minimising pressure on ecosystems, delivering a wide range of ecosystem services, improving public health and generating fair economic returns for farmers. Projects should address all of the following outcomes:
Agricultural landscapes that are dominated by intensively managed crops and grasslands, are restored[1] through co-designed (with farmers and other land managers, local communities, agricultural advisory services, landscape planners, the nature conservation sector etc.) large-scale, experimental pollinator-friendly practices and services and through social innovation processes, such as new innovative approaches to enhance community participatory planning and innovative business models.
Management, restoration, conservation and connectivity of wild pollinator habitats follow scientific and policy recommendations, which have been tested in the projects on their applicability. The range of recommendations in question is set in the Assessment Report on Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production of IPBES[2] and the updated Plan of Action of the international initiative on the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators[3].
Systemic approaches provide an effective enabling environment for stakeholder actions. They demonstrate that coherent and comprehensive policies for the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators at various governance levels can be demonstrated at least at landscape scale. , and contributing to foster sustainable agricultural practices while ensuring farming viability and profitability, for different agricultural sectors.
Improved coordination in governance, as well as enhanced data accessibility, financing and maintenance agreements for actions beneficial for pollinators are achieved
Adaptive management of measures for the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators is informed by continuous monitoring and assessing of the outcomes, including by using results-based payment schemes.
Scope:
This topic aims at maintaining and restoring species-rich pollinator communities and their services in agricultural landscapes dominated by intensive land use, and facilitating the uptake of pollinator-friendly practices at wider scale.
The direct and indirect drivers of pollinator decline are cross-cutting in nature .This calls for the need to ensure policy coherence and to integrate pollinator and pollination considerations not only in policy measures that support the transition towards more sustainable agricultural practices, but also across sectors (for example forestry, consumption and health) and at different spatial scales (farm, landscape, ecosystem).
Despite efforts, many of the main direct drivers of pollinator loss have remained largely unchanged over the years: habitat fragmentation and land use change, the widespread use of synthetic chemicals in agriculture and in other sectors, invasive alien species, and pathogens (in case of managed pollinators). In particular, great attention has been focused on drivers linked to intensive agricultural practices, such as monoculture, and the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides that can have direct and indirect effects on pollinators. In addition, the increasing negative impact on pollinator habitats of other direct drivers, such as climate change, have exacerbated the problem.
This topic aims at restoring and maintaining species-rich pollinator communities and their services in agricultural landscapes characterised by intensive farming practices, and facilitating the uptake of pollinator-friendly practices in the agricultural sector at a wide scale, in different pedo-climatic conditions across Europe. The proposed projects should emphasise mainstreaming pollination concerns into policies, developing and implementing measures on the ground to support the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators, addressing risks, and building capacity. In doing this, they should involve all relevant stakeholders along the agri-food chain and share knowledge on multiple levels to integrate pollination considerations into farming, land use and other management decisions, focusing collaborative research on emerging issues and prevailing needs.
The proposed projects should build on existing experience[4] in particular on lessons learned and best practices gained through EU-funded projects and initiatives such as those supported by Horizon 2020, Results-Based Payment Scheme projects[5], the LIFE programme, and prepare the uptake of approaches developed and tested in this topic into future EU-funded activities (such as LIFE, the common agricultural policy, Horizon Europe). The proposals should show how their results may contribute to the EU Pollinators Initiative[6], feed into relevant IPBES functions, and ensure cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity. Coordination with the two following topics should be envisaged: ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-10: Cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-20: Support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC’.
Projects are expected to secure additional funding or in-kind contributions when implementing restoration actions.
Proposals should include specific tasks and envisage sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g. activities, workshops, as well as joint communication and dissemination) with all projects funded under this topic for aspects of horizontal nature and for cooperation with other projects such as BiodivERsA, Oppla, the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity, relevant H2020 projects such as SHOWCASE and HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-08: ‘Agroforestry to meet climate, biodiversity and farming sustainability goals’. Actions should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant for pollinators and the restoration of their habitats. Furthermore, cooperation is expected with the European partnership on biodiversity[7] and with the Science Service (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-19: A mechanism for science to inform implementation, monitoring, review and ratcheting up the new EU biodiversity strategy (‘Science Service’), and with other large-scale initiatives under Horizon Europe, such as the candidate partnership on agroecology, living labs, research infrastructures and the proposed mission ‘Caring for soils is caring for life’.
The proposals should address all of the following points:
Demonstrate measures to diversify large-scale farming systems and the resulting feeding resources and habitats of pollinators in agricultural lands, grasslands and semi-natural areas, through agro-ecological practices, including organic farming and agroforestry, as well as through home gardens, and forestry systems where relevant to the restored landscapes, with a view to ensure heterogeneous habitats formed by native species that offer diversified floral and nesting resources for pollinators;
Create set-asides for nature, such as uncultivated patches of vegetation, to enhance floral diversity, and to ensure native, diverse, abundant and continuous floral resources for pollinator across time and space;
The two points mentioned above combined should cover at least 50% of the proposed budget.
Analyse and evaluate different options to protect and conserve threatened pollinator species as well as their natural environment, and elaborate the requirements to promote recognition of pollinator-friendly practices and consequences on pollination functions and services in existing certification schemes; and develop methods for the inclusion of pollinator conservation into ecosystem restoration frameworks (in particular on grassland and other agro-ecosystems).
Develop prototypes of potential extension services, farmer-to-farmer sharing approaches and farmer field schools to strengthen synergies between scientific evidence, traditional knowledge, conservation and farmer-researcher community practices, to exchange knowledge and provide hands-on education and empowerment of local farming communities on pollinators. This could include for instancefostering networks for exchanges of native seeds
Elaborate, based on the large-scale approach, how the promotion of coherent policies across sectors and issues (e.g. biodiversity, agriculture and food security, chemicals and pollution, reduction of inequality, climate change and disaster risk reduction) could look like for pollinators. This scalability plan should be developed with the involvement of the communities concerned, and should include the dissemination of innovative solutions and practices, and a process for commitments in adopting large-scale restoration of pollinator communities within governance and financing systems, to allow replication and upscaling across the EU, associated countries and internationally. It should seek guarantees for the non-reversibility and/or continuity of restoration activities and/or further replication and/or expansion, implementation of sustainable management practices and monitoring after the end of the projects.
Assess and propose options to develop and implement innovative incentives, consistent with international obligations, for farmers and other actors along the agri-food chain, to encourage the adoption of pollinator-friendly practices (e.g. carbon sequestration measures that increase pollinator habitats; conservation of uncultivated areas for pollinator forage; communication to consumers and other actors on the benefits of pollinator-friendly practices, etc). This should also cover assessing the impacts on farmers’ income, on overall business performance of farms, as well as on social aspects in farming communities.
Build on existing knowledge, developed inter alia by EU-funded research projects, to assess options to remove or reduce incentives that are harmful to pollinators and their habitats (e.g. pesticides subsidies; incentives for pesticide use as credit requirements from banks), and to promote alternative approaches to pesticide use (e.g. Integrated Pest Management), taking into consideration the needs of farmers, gardeners, land managers, indigenous people, local communities and other stakeholders[8];
Design and test a system to monitor the effectiveness of the large-scale interventions, taking into consideration the scale-dependent aspects of protecting pollinators and managing pollination functions and services, using standard methods in line with the proposal for an EU Pollinator Monitoring Scheme[9], and contribute to their improvement.
The proposals should develop scientifically robust and transparent methodologies, building on achievements from previous research activities. To ensure trustworthiness, swift and wide adoption by user communities, and to support EU and national (including from associated countries) policy-makers, actions should adopt high standards of transparency and openness, going beyond documentation of results and extending to aspects such as assumptions, models and data quality during the projects life.

In line with the EU biodiversity strategy, a successful proposal will develop knowledge and tools to understand the role of transformative change for biodiversity policy making, finance and business leaders, address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and initiate, accelerate and upscale biodiversity-relevant transformative changes in our society.
The projects should address all of the following outcomes:
Inform approaches tackling biodiversity loss and implementing nature-based solutions that consider how behaviour, lifestyles, religious, societal and cultural values shape the choices of producers and consumers, institutions and their policy decisions.
The motives behind broad societal changes and transitions are taken up in the design of relevant policies, communication and engagement campaigns and other actions.
Leverage points in those sectors with the greatest impact on biodiversity are addressed, as the role of decisive actors (civil society, education institutions, policy makers, financing and business leaders, retailers) and their inter-sectorial consultation is known. This includes human rights and due diligence across economic value chains, as well as the role of employment patterns for a just transition.
The understanding of the biodiversity inter-dependencies of the SDGs has improved; IPBES and IPCC are strengthened by the contribution of European research and innovation. Approaches, tools and knowledge influence policies at the adequate level on transformative change for biodiversity – the key elements for this change are delivered by the portfolio of cooperating projects (of which these projects form part).
Scope:
Proposals should engage with civil society organisations – in particular those working on gender, diversity, equity and inclusion –, social partners, policy makers, financing, industry and business leaders, and retailers and value-led (such as religious and cultural) institutions when addressing the role of enabling players for transformative changes in biodiversity actions, exemplified at relevant levels from local to global. They should identify and test measures to overcome barriers for behaviour changes in biodiversity action, considering ethical questions in behavioural economics, e.g. linked to future generations. This should acknowledge the interdependence of the climate and biodiversity crisis.
The proposals should explore intersectionality approaches and consider interlocking systems of power between gender and other social categories and identities such as religion, ethnicity and race (including migrants and refugees), social class and wealth, gender identity and sexual orientation and disability to better address access to and ownership of nature-based solutions.
The proposals should analyse and address the impact of intrinsic vs economic/utilitarian values. They should include an estimation of the importance of engineered vs haphazard policy making factors at relevant levels, and specify and address effects of processes affecting adherence to democracy, voting campaigns, science denialism[1].
The proposals should build their analysis upon the synergies of multiple Sustainable Development Goals, to deliver direct and indirect biodiversity benefits, and of the role of biodiversity in reaching the set of Sustainable Development Goals, considering the importance of behaviour, lifestyle, religious and cultural values.
The proposals should produce case studies and collect good and failed examples that could inform these transformations[2] and inform and inspire transformative change through learning, co-creation and dialogue.
Proposals should include specific tasks and provide sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g. activities, workshops, as well as joint communication and dissemination) with all projects with all projects on transformative change related to biodiversity funded under this destination, and should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant for transformational change and on biodiversity knowledge[3]. Furthermore, cooperation is expected with the European partnership on biodiversity and the Science Service (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-19: A mechanism for science to inform implementation, monitoring, review and ratcheting up of the new EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (‘Science Service’). Proposals should show how their results might provide timely information for major science-policy bodies such as the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as the Convention on Biological Diversity on project outcomes. Cooperation is expected with projects ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-20: Support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-2022-01-10: Cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity’.

In line with the EU biodiversity strategy, a successful proposal must develop knowledge and tools to understand the role of transformative change for biodiversity policy making, address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and initiate, accelerate and upscale biodiversity-relevant transformative changes in our society.
Projects must address all of the following outcomes:
Economically, socially, ethically and institutionally viable and sustainable pathways are designed to minimise biodiversity loss or to enhance biodiversity. These pathways should consider mutually influencing extraction, production, consumption, trade patterns in the medium- and long-term (beyond 2030).
Improve understanding of the human dimensions impacting biodiversity i.e. ethics, social context, institutions, organisation, behaviour will provide policy makers, industrial stakeholders and civil society the tools needed to reframe their actions, by highlighting the synergies of mainstreaming biodiversity with climate transitions, including on how to avoid or minimise trade-offs.
Better understand social norms and behaviours, linked to socio-economic values (e.g. ethics, social context of individuals, consumers, institutions, organisations, industry) affecting biodiversity.
Inform and motivate transformational change through learning, co-creation and dialogue based on case studies. The understanding of the biodiversity inter-dependencies of the SDGs has improved; IPBES and IPCC are strengthened through European research and innovation. Provide a set of approaches, tools and knowledge influence policies at the appropriate level on transformative change for biodiversity – the key elements for this change are delivered by the portfolio of cooperating projects (of which these projects form part).
With focus on assessing the nexus of extraction, production (including processing), consumption, trade and behaviour patterns, including transformative changes for climate change on biodiversity for the EU and Associated Countries, international cooperation in particular with African countries, Brazil, Latin American and Caribbean countries or the Mediterranean region is strongly encouraged.
Scope:
Proposals should address all the following points:
Assess how extraction, production, processing, consumption, trade, behaviour patterns, especially linked to primary production (e.g. livestock with/or energy crops, etc. including through tele-coupling from consumption and all along supply chains), integrated food systems, and transformative changes towards climate neutrality, affect biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Develop pathways together with key industries and key stakeholders to minimise loss of, and enhance biodiversity, whilst increasing the delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services. These industries cover food, feed, fibre, energy production and the wider food chain (related to bio-economy, renewable energies, infrastructure, technologies)[1], and the deployment of climate mitigation and adaptation measures potentially harmful for biodiversity (e.g. concrete walls in coastal areas, replacement of biodiversity rich ecosystems for energy crops, etc.).
Identify and address leverage points for transformational change in trade, triggering changes in established and new production and consumption patterns for new business models.
Highlight the potential of (1) public procurement for delivering biodiversity benefits and (2) nature-based solutions for enabling and accelerating the relevant aspects of transformative change.
Quantify investments into infrastructure and labour that could be shifted from impacting biodiversity negatively towards benefits for biodiversity, including the anticipation, mitigation and management of social, institutional and economic conflicts this may trigger (or decrease), to achieve a just transition process.
Understand and engage communities and other social actors, including through citizens science, and initiate behavioural changes leading to production and consumption patterns preventing further biodiversity loss.
Cooperate with ongoing activities to include biodiversity into integrated assessment models[2] and analyse the usability of existing and emerging concepts such as ‘Planetary Boundaries’, ‘Doughnut Economy’, ‘Environmental Footprints’.
Explain the relevance of transition pathways for biodiversity for competitive sustainability, towards a just transition in the full range of SDGs and climate neutrality.
Unsustainable production and consumption, including the role of trade for linking both, are pushing many of the direct drivers of biodiversity loss: land use change, overexploitation, climate change and pollution. Proposals should, based on a clear understanding of these relationships[3] address how leverage points and levers can be identified and used for generating benefits for biodiversity, e.g. through revision of regulation, standards, funding practices or governance processes.
They should highlight how the primary production sectors (in particular in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, raw material extraction, and also the construction sector) and the related infrastructure and energy provision and use impacts biodiversity directly. They should show effects on the direction of economic development, which leads to lock-in effects, inequalities, lack of capacities of institutions at every level to shift towards sustainable use, the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services. On patterns of consumption, proposals should show how their impacts such as uneven use and exploitation of resources, generation of waste and pollution, value setting, power setting in societies, institutions and financial streams could be addressed in business, institutional and consumer agendas to achieve positive outcomes for biodiversity.
Proposals should assess the cultural diversity that influences these compromises and people’s engagement, and lead the way to further mainstream biodiversity in socio-economic and environmental agendas, from the transformative aspect of changing extraction, production and processing, consumption, trade and behaviour patterns, including on actions for addressing climate change on biodiversity. They should also analyse and test the use of nature-based solutions as tool in this regard. Optimal and cost-effective use of behavioural games, networks of sensors, GIS-mapping, big data and observational programmes such as the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, through the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) as well as citizens' observatories, should be used as appropriate to enable the integration and visualisation of data.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Proposals should build their analysis upon the links between multiple Sustainable Development Goals, to deliver direct and indirect biodiversity benefits, and of the role of biodiversity in reaching the set of Sustainable Development Goals, when related to extraction, production, consumption, trade and behaviour patterns.
Proposals should produce case studies and collect good and bad examples that could inform these transformations and inform and inspire transformative change through learning, co-creation and dialogue.
Proposals should include specific tasks and ensure sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g. activities, workshops, as well as joint communication and dissemination) with all projects on transformative change related to biodiversity. This concerns projects funded under this destination, or under calls included in Destination ‘Fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption’ related to transformational change (Fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption) that aim to deliver various co-benefits, including on the reduction of biodiversity loss. Projects should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant for transformational change and on biodiversity knowledge[4]. Cooperation and possibly synergies with relevant topics in Cluster 5 should be explored and established as relevant. Furthermore, cooperation is expected with the European partnership on biodiversity and with the Science Service.
Proposals should show how their results might provide timely information for major science-policy bodies such as the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as the Convention on Biological Diversity on project outcomes. Cooperation is requested with projects under ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-20: Support to processes triggered by IPBES and IPCC’ and ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-10: Cooperation with the Convention on Biological Diversity’.

","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
Researchers, developers of medical interventions, and health care professionals have a much better understanding of basic biological pathways (genetic and epigenetic blueprints) conferring susceptibility to and protecting against overweight/obesity, i.e. how genetic, epigenetic, environmental, socio-economic and lifestyle factors interact to drive or prevent the transition from normal weight to overweight/obesity throughout the life course.
Health care professionals, national/regional/local public authorities and other relevant actors (e.g. schools, canteens, hospitals, work places, shopping malls, sport centres):
Have access to, adopt and implement evidence-based clinical guidelines, best practices, coordinated, pan-European, multidisciplinary preventive strategies, policy recommendations and/or new policies to fight overweight/obesity and their co-morbidities throughout the life course.
Have access to and make use of a robust outcomes framework and tool-kit for standardised collection of economic and cost data related to the prevention and treatment of overweight/obesity and its co-morbidities at population level across European regions and countries.
Adopt and implement tailor-made prevention campaigns to tackle overweight/obesity, including campaigns for improving integration of health education into academic learning and raising awareness of health care providers and citizens.
Citizens have access to and make use of new tools and services to make informed decisions about lifestyle choices that will prevent them from becoming overweight/obese.
Scope:
Obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Although health has improved in the EU over the last decades, the prevalence of obesity has tripled in many countries of the EU. It is known that once individuals become overweight or obese, they are at risk of developing related diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer). Overweight and obesity are largely preventable. In the current pandemic, the issue of overweight/obesity has become even more prominent, highlighting the need for prevention of overweight/obesity.
Increased efforts in research and innovation are critical for developing and testing the impact of tools, initiatives, interventions, strategies, programmes, policies and their implementation to prevent overweight/obesity. The use of best practices, harmonisation guidelines and/or standard operating procedures, developed at various levels (from local to national) in the EU and beyond, will be the foundation for new research.
Cultural diversity, urban/rural dichotomy, socio-economic status, age groups, sex and gender differences should be investigated, where relevant. Strong collaborations across sectors and with other European projects dealing with issues such as agriculture, aquaculture, food, environment, etc. are welcome. Proposals should engage citizens, civil society organisations (e.g. employers/employee organisations, charities), authorities (e.g. municipalities and health authorities) and institutions (schools, canteens, hospitals, work places, shopping malls, sport centres), local producers, etc. in the development of their actions to ensure acceptability and deployment. Proposals should aim to develop scientifically robust and transparent methodologies, building on achievements from previous research activities.
Proposals should address several of the following research bottlenecks:
A comprehensive understanding of biological pathways (genetic, epigenetic, molecular, microbiome, and/or neuroimmune) conferring susceptibility to and protecting against uncontrolled “weight gain"".
Identification of socio-economic and lifestyle factors influencing consumer behaviour and their association to overweight/obesity prevention.
Identification of pre-obesity biomarkers (genetic, laboratory, imaging, etc.) and their association to lifestyle and environmental interventions aiming at obesity prevention and tailored to specific target populations.
Mapping existing implementation research activities to prevent overweight/obesity, outcome analyses and identification of best practices.
Conducting a thorough meta-review of information from available scientific literature and identification of the relationship between the risk for overweight/obesity and the biology of obesity, lifestyle habits, exposures, susceptibility to co-morbidities and/or all of their combinations.
Developing recommendations and guidelines for what constitutes an appropriate healthy diet for different age and health groups.
Understanding the causal links between overweight/obesity and sedentary behaviour, quality and quantity and types of food/drinks, physical activity, and personality traits.
Designing a creative and engaging programme to reach the optimal balance between diets and physical activity for the prevention of overweight/obesity.
Analysing obesity stigma, stress and work-life balance, circadian rhythm disruption, mental health (including psychological problems), screen-time dependency, drugs and side effect of drugs, for the prevention of overweight/obesity.
Addressing inequality aspects of overweight/obesity at multiple levels, taking into account vulnerable groups, gender and socio-economic factors.
Setting up pilots to assess the effectiveness of obesity management strategies, including cost-effectiveness, and analyse the impact of inactions, taking into account co-morbidities and value-based care system.
Developing a system for monitoring population indicators relevant to overweight/obesity by extending European Core Health Indicators.
Proposals should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between health professionals, patients and their families, and unleashes the potential of social innovation.
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consists of providing added-value regarding aspects of healthier school environments, effectiveness of policies influencing food preferences as well as improving the food offer and food environment.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes.
Clinicians, medical professionals and citizens have access to and use validated AI tools for disease risk assessment. Hence, citizens are better informed for managing their own health.
Health care professionals utilise robust, trustworthy and privacy-preserving AI tools that help them to assess and predict the risk for and/or progression of chronic non-communicable diseases. Hence, citizens benefit from improved health outcomes.
Health care professionals develop evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the implementation of AI-based personalised prevention strategies. Hence, citizens benefit from optimized health care measures superior to the standard-of-care.
Health care professionals employ quantitative indicators in order to identify and follow-up on individuals with high risk for the development and/or risk for the progression of chronic non-communicable diseases.
Scope:
It is widely recognised that health systems must put more emphasis on prevention and adopt a person-centred approach. Artificial intelligence (AI) along with the increased availability of health data hold great potential to pave the way for personalised prevention and enable progress towards risk prediction and early detection of chronic non-communicable diseases.
This topic will support multidisciplinary research, build on broad stakeholder engagement and support proposals developing novel robust and trustworthy[1] AI tools to enable timely personalised prevention approaches for chronic non-communicable diseases/disorders. The topic does not exclude any diseases/disorders.
Proposals are expected to develop and test AI tools for assessing and predicting the risk of developing a disease and/or the risk of disease progression once it is diagnosed, taking into account the individuals’ (or groups) genotypes, phenotypes, life-style, occupational/environmental stressors and/or socio-economic and behavioural characteristics, as necessary. Sex and gender aspects should be considered, wherever relevant.
The AI tools may include a broad range of technological solutions on their own and/or in combination with other relevant state-of-the-art technologies (i.e. AI algorithms, mobile apps and sensors, robotics, e-health tools, telemedicine etc.)
Proposals should implement proof-of-concept studies to test and validate the performance of their AI tools in the real-world setting and compare their performance to the established practice.
The applicants should ensure that the AI tools developed are driven by relevant end-users/citizens/health care professionals needs. Therefore, the proposals are expected to introduce concrete measures for the involvement of the end-users throughout the AI development process and not only in the last phases of development. SME(s) participation is encouraged with the aim to strengthen the scientific and technological basis of SME(s) and valorise their innovations for the people’s benefit.
Proposals should address all of the following:
Leverage existing high-quality health-relevant data from multiple sources (i.e. cohorts, electronic health records and registries, taking into account the individual’s genotypic/phenotypic, medical, life-style, socio-economic, behavioural data etc.) and/or generation of new high-quality health data necessary for the rigorous development of the AI disease-risk tools.
Develop the adequate performance metrics to assess the technical robustness of the developed AI tools for risk assessment of disease and/or disease progression and in particular their accuracy, reliability, reproducibility and generalisability. Proposals should assess the possible inherent bias introduced to the AI tools originating from the data quality used for their development.
Develop the criteria to assess the effectiveness of the AI tools for disease risk assessment in terms of improving health outcomes and enabling personalised prevention strategies.
Implement proof of concept and/or feasibility studies to validate the AI tools for risk assessment of disease and/or disease progression in a relevant end-users environment and/or real-world setting and assess their performance in comparison to the standard-of-care.
Proposals should adhere to the FAIR[2] data principles and apply good practices for GDPR-compliant personal data protection. Proposals are encouraged to implement international standards and best practices used in the development of AI solutions.
Integration of ethics and health humanities perspectives to ensure an ethical approach to the development of AI solutions. In relation to the use and interpretation of data, special attention should be paid to systematically assess for gender and ethnic bias and/or discrimination when developing and using data-driven AI tools.
To ensure citizens’ trust, wide uptake by user communities and scalability of the solutions across clinical contexts, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness of the AI tool, going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, architecture, code and underlying data.
Applicants are highly encouraged to deliver a plan for the regulatory acceptability of their technologies and to interact at an early stage with the regulatory bodies, whenever relevant.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.

Health care professionals, national/regional public authorities and other relevant actors in key settings (e.g. schools, workplaces, etc.):
Have access to and apply evidence-based, innovative, cost-effective/cost-neutral, large-scale, comprehensive strategies and interventions for the promotion of mental health and the prevention of mental ill health, targeting the most vulnerable populations;
Adopt clinical guidelines, best practices, implementation strategies and policy recommendations (as applicable to them) to mitigate the mental health burden and help cope with the (combined) effects of a transforming Europe (e.g. the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, environmental degradation, energy transition, demographic and migration factors, digitalisation, and exponential technological advancements);
The scientific community together with the public authorities anticipate new and emerging risks to mental health associated with a transforming Europe, contributing to better and inclusive public mental health preparedness.
Citizens have access to and make use of new tools and services to take informed decisions about their wellbeing and mental health care needs (including for self-management and self-care).
Citizens feel less stigmatised and marginalised due to their mental ill health.
Scope:
Against the backdrop of a transforming Europe and in the midst of a global pandemic, the EU is committed to lead the transition to a healthier planet and a new digital world. The health and wellbeing of its citizens is a prerequisite to achieve this aspiration.
On the one hand, extreme weather and environmental disasters have risen dramatically over the last decade. Links between these events and serious mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic disorder and suicide, have been reported. Moreover, several new words such as “eco-anxiety”, “ecoparalysis” and “ecological grief” have been coined to express the acute and/or chronic effects on mental health caused by climate and environmental changes.
On the other hand, digital technologies and the achievement of the Digital Single Market – one of the EU’s key priorities – are transforming our economy, our industries as well as our culture and lifestyle. Digitalisation, including digitally-enabled technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence, are penetrating much faster into societies than in the past and affect us all. Accordingly, the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”’ is changing the way we work (e.g. workplaces, working practices and patterns, the workforce and its skills, and how we perceive work) as well as the way we live. The exponential incorporation of digital technologies in our daily lives has already caused profound changes in the way we communicate and is likely to have significant impact (both positive and negative) on mental health and intellectual/cognitive ability, in particular of the youth. Digital platforms can provide mental health support as well as increase social inclusiveness. However, digital technologies also introduce new risks, such as continuous connectivity, cyberbullying and exposure to inappropriate or fake content.
Accordingly, the proposed research should aim to deliver in all three dimensions listed below, focusing on one or several of the (combined) effects of a transforming Europe highlighted in the “Expected Outcomes”[1].
Provide a comprehensive knowledge base of how a transforming Europe can influence mental health in a fast-evolving society, especially in the most vulnerable populations, by consolidating data from relevant sources and/or acquiring new data, and by reviewing existing methodologies.
Develop and implement (pilot and/or scale-up) interventions, which promote wellbeing and prevent mental illness to help cope with and mitigate the stress of a changing society, including digitalisation, climate change and/or other factors highlighted in the “Expected Outcomes”.8 The interventions should target relevant settings (e.g. workplaces, schools) and the most vulnerable populations (e.g. children and adolescents, the elderly, people with pre-existing health conditions and co-morbidities and other high-risk groups such as socio-economic disadvantaged groups, migrants, etc.). Integration of care and coordination among different settings from communities to health care is desirable. The effectiveness of the interventions should be evaluated, inter alia, in terms of health outcomes, (comparative) cost-effectiveness, implementation facilitators and barriers. Depending on the aspects covered by the proposed research, desired outputs may include, but are not limited to:
Evidence-based guidelines for health care professionals on the promotion of mental wellbeing and prevention of mental illness related to ICT and climate and environment change (including screening methods).
Evidenced-based pedagogical practices for education professionals to foster mental health promotion in schools (including higher education) and/or via eLearning.
Consultation during school time to educate students (e.g. on coping with change) and to detect early students at risk.
Educational material and campaigns targeting the most vulnerable groups, (e.g. children and the elderly), disseminated via the most appropriate and effective media and communication channels, to improve health literacy, skills, attitudes and self-awareness leading to a better (self-)management of wellbeing and/or mental ill health.
Studies on occupational mental health in the workplace, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises, e.g.: i) understanding the impact of a 24-hour digital economy on workers’ well-being, also in terms of managerial control mechanisms, work-life balance and privacy and developing/piloting new methods to protect and support workers’ well-being in this respect; ii) designing information and training campaigns for workers to integrate the already visible impacts of digitalisation-induced changes into the professional risk assessment processes; iii) developing return-to-work programmes, also exploring innovative collaboration between mental health services, (life-long) education, and employment sectors. This will ensure appropriate support to better integrate individuals affected by mental ill health in the workforce and the society.
Inform policy-makers and regulators on: i) the prevalence and burden of mental ill health related to a transforming European society (e.g. digital technologies, climate change, etc); and/or ii) the effects of a transforming European society (e.g. digitalisation, climate change and transition to “green jobs”) on occupational mental health; and/or iii) the (comparative) cost-effectiveness of public mental health interventions/policy choices.
Research should be multidisciplinary, including medical sciences, social sciences, the humanities, and the arts, if relevant. It is important to consider aspects such as (associated) behavioural patterns, stigma and novel social dynamics as well as different socioeconomic, cultural and geographical contexts. In all instances, sex and gender-related issues must be taken into account. All data should be disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant variables, such as by measures of socioeconomic status (i.e. take into account the socioeconomic gradient in mental health). International collaboration is encouraged.
Proposals should involve end-users (including civil society organisations) and/or strategic partners in the design and during the course of the project. Possible end-users and strategic partners could include local or regional authorities, community services, employers, schools/universities, cultural institutions, insurance companies, civil society organisations, communities, among others. Proposals should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between health professionals, patients and their families, and unleashes the potential of social innovation.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 “Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Empowered patients and citizens of all ages, gender, social and economic background adopt and use digital tools to monitor their health status independently.
A strong European ecosystem is created by innovators in the health domain, including, but not limited to SMEs, Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs), accelerators, incubators, (European) Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH)[1], European Reference Sites of the EIP-AHA[2] and Knowledge Hubs, involving end-users.
Public and private entities adopt the innovations of European digital health companies, especially SMEs and mid-caps, enhancing their sustainability and resilience.
Citizens, patients, health practitioners and facilities, public and private actors access and make use of sustainable EU-wide reference repository of digitally-enabled innovative solutions addressing all health related sectors, areas and segments, with particular focus on self-management and prevention.
Scope:
The EU has supported innovation of digital tools for better and more personalised treatments and self-monitoring of citizens and patients throughout Europe. However, adoption and deployment of digital health solutions in practice, both in the public health system and by private players remains low.
Building on the recommendations from the report of the Strategic Forum for Important Projects of Common European Interest[3], coordination and support is needed to: i) create a pan-European operational network as a mechanism (a European Smart Health Innovation Hub) that can assess and promote Smart Health initiatives; ii) stimulate the demand-side and the uptake of Smart Health products and services; and iii) support the development of Smart Health products and services.
Applicants should propose activities addressing the need to bring together different actors, working on innovative digital health solutions and to reinforce their collaboration, exchange and efforts on scaling-up digital health solutions across Europe. Proposals should encourage a people-centred approach that empowers citizens and patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, health practitioners and providers, and other public and private actors, and unleashes the potential of social innovation.
Applicants should link various existing repositories of digital health solutions, which are already deployable as part of different EU projects and initiatives. It is necessary to integrate them into a European Digital Health Smart Innovation Hub, which will serve as a European reference platform for scalable digital health solutions, both for public organisations and private actors, connecting supply and demand side.
Applicants should propose activities in several of the following areas:
Promote transfer and exchange of knowledge and best practices (such as twinnings) between different actors, such as SMEs, mid-caps, accelerators, incubators, RTOs, EDIHs[4], Reference Sites of the EIP-AHA[5] and Knowledge Hubs, such as EIT KIC Health[6], eHealth Hub[7] or mHealth Hub[8] – working on innovation of digital health solutions, including training to end-users, e.g. citizens, patients, health care providers, and deployment strategies.
Promote scalability of digital innovation solutions by organising market places and pitching events to public health organisations and private entities and by involving industry and Member States representatives.
Integrating existing repositories into a sustainable European repository, serving as a reference of ready to market solutions (supply side) and public and private organisations adopting them (demand side), as well as best practices.
Reinforce the European Digital Health ecosystem by enhancing collaboration and networking between the different actors working on digital health innovation across Europe. Synergies with other relevant initiatives, like the Digital Transformation Accelerator that will manage the network of European Digital Innovation Hubs are encouraged, as well as with relevant initiatives in AI, Data and Robotics in Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe and other programmes.
The Digital Health solutions that would be part of the European Smart Health Innovation Hub should match the needs of all citizens and patients, regardless of their age, gender, social or economic background.

","LIFE Project Grants
","02 December 2021
","03 March 2022","Objective:
Under this topic, a ‘European City Facility’ shall be run under the LIFE CET programme, which builds on the experiences gained from the current Horizon 2020 European City Facility[1] (H2020 EUCF) and envisages an appropriate follow-up and upscale of its fundamental approach(es).
Significantly enhanced investments will be needed to attain the ambitious objectives of the EU climate and energy policy and, in particular, the dedicated targets set for the years 2030 and 2050. This is also emphasized in the European Green Deal Investment Plan[2], which aims at mobilising at least €1 trillion of sustainable investments over the course of 10 years for Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
In this context, the level of sustainable energy and, in particular, energy efficiency investments needs to be increased considerably by both public and private funding sources, with an overall emphasis on progressively maximising the leverage ratio of private to public finance. This is also embedded in the “Renovation Wave”, which, in line with the European Green Deal[3] and the Climate Target Plan, addresses the strategic priority to substantially enhance energy efficiency in buildings and related investments to ensure a larger contribution of this sector to the increased 2030 climate and energy targets. Along the priorities identified by the Smart Financing for Smart Buildings initiative[4] and in order to achieve the Renovation Wave objectives of doubling building renovation rates and fostering deep energy renovation, EU decarbonisation efforts call for a more effective use of public funds, boosting project aggregation and building a substantial pipeline of energy efficiency investment projects across Europe.
Cities and municipalities play a key role in aggregating smaller projects into sizable packages and in mobilising the significant amount of finance needed for the energy transition. However, the degree of European cities and municipalities succeeding in developing and scaling up investment packages is still too limited in light of their overall potential and the challenges ahead. A key gap is the lack of capacity and/or resources of public authorities, especially of small and medium-sized municipalities, to transform their long-term climate and energy strategies, for instance Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAPs) or similar, into credible investment concepts enabling access to different finance sources. In particular, public authorities in many cases lack (access to) financial, technical and legal expertise needed to collect additional data, develop an investment programme of scale (for instance, pooling projects and/or bundling projects with neighbouring constituencies) or design finance strategies which demonstrate sufficient maturity.
Such investment concepts would allow a large number of European cities and municipalities to start or intensify the process of mobilising investments in sustainable energy in a clearly tailored and target-oriented way. Depending on the underlying investment portfolio and structure, such concepts could be used to directly approach investors and/or financiers for more in-depth investment discussions and negotiations, and/or, where relevant, envisage combination/blending with other EU financing streams and services to trigger the expected investment (e.g. Cohesion Policy Funds, InvestEU Fund[5], National Recovery and Resilience Plans, PDA[6], National Investment Platforms).
Scope:
Proposals should take into account experiences regarding the ongoing H2020 EUCF, which is addressing above issues, and envisage an appropriate follow-up and upscale of its fundamental approach(es). In this context, proposals are expected to run a 'European City Facility' under LIFE which offers financial support and services to cities and municipalities or their groupings:
The European City Facility should offer financial support to European cities and municipalities to develop investment concepts for sustainable energy investments, with a dedicated focus on energy efficiency. These concepts should be developed within a limited period of time and cover, inter-alia: a clear identification of the potential project pipeline, a legal analysis, a governance analysis, a description of how the investments will be financed and a design of the process to launch the investments. In this context:
Proposals are expected to foresee financial support to third parties, in the form of grants including ‘lump sums’ ('financial support scheme'), and around 70-75% of the budget should directly benefit cities, municipalities or their groupings in this context.
In accordance with the general call conditions on financial support to third parties, applicants should in particular also clearly specify why financial support to third parties is needed and how it will be managed, and provide a list of the different types of activities for which a third party may receive financial support. The process and criteria for allocation of financial support to third parties need to conform to EU standards concerning transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality. The proposal must also clearly describe the results to be obtained.
Proposers should demonstrate the capacity to run a financial support scheme at large scale in accordance with LIFE CET standards and that they are able to select the most cost-efficient and appropriate applications taking into account, inter alia, the scale of the potential investment and energy savings, as well as the number of inhabitants covered in the specific context targeted.
The European City Facility should additionally offer services at the national/regional level to support cities and municipalities in the application, investment concept development and investment implementation processes.
The European City Facility should furthermore envisage appropriate replication measures and exchange of best practices among cities and municipalities, in particular also with a view to enabling the uptake and efficient operationalisation of the fundamental approaches of its scheme at the national/regional level.
In this context, the European City Facility should establish an appropriate framework for comprehensive monitoring, analysis and capitalisation of results, notably the leverage factor achieved by the EUCF financial support with regard to envisaged investment concepts and related source(s) of funding.
Proposers should be deeply rooted in municipal sustainable energy/climate planning and financial engineering of sustainable energy and, in particular, energy efficiency investments.
Proposers should demonstrate a deep understanding of the strategic nature of this initiative, as regards, inter alia, the different challenges for upscaling finance for sustainable energy investments and, in particular, for mobilising private financing sources.
Proposers should also demonstrate that they are able to mobilise a critical mass of cities/municipalities or their groupings and have a sound and inclusive outreach strategy to cities and municipalities across Europe.
In order to qualify for support through the European City Facility, cities and municipalities or their groupings should, inter alia, provide proof of political commitment, clarify existing planning processes and resources, demonstrate an ambitious scale of potential investment and level of energy savings in the specific context targeted based on politically approved SECAPs or plans of similar ambition, describe the investment sectors targeted, the type of financial solutions envisaged and the governance to develop the investment concept, envisage a convincing plan on the engagement of key stakeholders in the relevant (technical and financial) segments, including citizens, as well as a plan for long-term capacity building within the public administration, and commit to a monitoring of investment implementation for 2 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 16 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets, wherever possible:
Increased, well-demonstrated and documented, leveraging of (private) finance into sustainable energy and, in particular, energy efficiency investments by public authorities
Number of investment concepts delivered and number of investment concepts transformed into ambitious tangible investments as a result of the action
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro)
Primary energy savings/Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (GWh/year)
Number of public authority staff with increased capacity for developing investible sustainable energy and, in particular, energy efficiency projects
Uptake by potential replicators on the national/regional level
Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year)

Outcomes and deliverables
Delivery of at least 3 digital product passport prototypes, one in each of the 3 key value chains mentioned above, including agreement on data and system architectures. The work will support the goals of the Green Deal and in particular Circular Economy Action Plan’s Sustainable Product Initiative, the EU Digital strategy’s Circular Electronics Initiative and the EU Data strategy by improving product sustainability, boosting material and energy efficiency, enabling new business models and circular value extraction based on data sharing.
The work should also contribute to enhanced concertation of stakeholders, provision of a roadmap for open and standardised approaches for viable use of product passport based on digital innovations that is beneficial in terms of environmental sustainability and circular business opportunities. The results are also expected to support the EU Single Market providing consistent information about products, across the value chain and borders, to business, customers and authorities.
Objective:
The Sustainable Products Initiative foreseen in the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP, COM(2020) 98 final) should establish a Digital Product Passport (DPP) that gathers data on a product and its value chain. The objective of the DPP is to support sustainable production, to enable the transition to circular economy, to provide new business opportunities to economic actors, to support consumers in making sustainable choices and to allow authorities to verify compliance with legal obligations.
The objective of this Coordination and Support Action as is to prepare the ground for a gradual deployment as of 2023 of digital product passport in minimum 3 key value chains: electronics (at least consumer electronics), batteries as defined in and considered in the proposal for a Regulation on batteries and at least another one of the key value chains identified in CEAP (“Priority will be given to addressing product groups identified in the context of the value chains featuring in this Action Plan, such as electronics, ICT and textiles but also furniture and high impact intermediary products such as steel, cement and chemicals.” (CEAP).
Scope:
Specific contribution is expected on identifying the key DPP data in consultation with private and public stakeholders, as well as establishing protocols for secure and tailored access for relevant stakeholders. The work will also contribute to the development of standardized and open digital solutions for identification, tracking, mapping and sharing of product information along its life-cycle ensuring interoperability across borders and a well-functioning EU Internal Market.
Particular emphasis should be given to balanced and inclusive engagement of all relevant stakeholders throughout the value chain and to optimal use of digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and blockchain.
Deliverables should include a roadmap with milestones for a gradual deployment of DPP and delivery of DPP prototypes in electronics, batteries and another one or more key value chains of the CEAP, based on analysis of existing and upcoming legislation, existing standards, past and ongoing activities related to dataspaces and product passport in these sectors. While different product groups will have different information requirements, a common data set to enable cross-sectoral use, interoperable and consistent standards, systems and classifications should also be proposed. The business model to ensure the continuity of the product passport development and use has to be addressed.
This CSA will support the establishment of an interoperable data space building on and linking to manufacturing dataspaces (see section 2.2.1.4) and other available and relevant data sources. The awarded consortium will work in partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre (see topic 2.2.2.1) in order to ensure alignment with the Smart Middleware Platform developed under topic 2.1.1, and actions in the context of section 2.2.1 of this Work Programme, and in particular:
* the data space reference architecture, building blocks and common toolboxes to be used;
* the common standards, including semantic standards and interoperability protocols, both domain-specific and crosscutting;
* The data governance models, business models and strategies for running data spaces.

Outcomes and deliverables
The investment will deliver a pan-European network of Safer Internet Centres (SICs) that will allow children and young people to become more resilient digital users through awareness-raising activities in informal and formal education (e.g., youth participation activities, workshops, classroom visits, competitions). Parents, carers, teachers, and other professionals working with children will gain a better understanding of the risks and opportunities of children accessing digital content and services, through information sessions, train the trainers programmes, and online and offline material. Local, national, and European actors will gain timely information on emerging risks through the helpline service. Public authorities including law enforcement agencies will have access to resources and services, and exchanges with hotline analysts to develop better preventive measures and to remove online child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in an effective manner. The private sector will benefit from increased market opportunities for high quality online content and will cooperate with the SICs through joint initiatives and awareness campaigns such as the Safer Internet Day.
Objective:
The objective of the topic is to support national SICs (i.e., hubs gathering NGOs, government bodies/agencies, private sector organisations) in providing online safety information, educational resources, public awareness tools and counselling and reporting services (through dedicated helplines and hotlines) for young people, teachers, and parents. The activities performed by the SICs will help minors to tackle online risks and to become media literate, resilient digital citizens, and will allow citizens to anonymously report online child sexual abuse material (CSAM).
Scope:
The funding will ensure the financial sustainability of the European SICs, by enabling the awarded consortiums to provide at least:
A centre for raising awareness among children, parents, and teachers about online opportunities and risks. The focus will be to identify and address emerging risks (e.g., self-generated sexualised content) and challenges such as mental and physical health issues related to the use of technologies (self-harm, addiction, perception of self-identity and self-image);
A helpline to give advice and support to parents and children on issues related to children's use of digital technologies and services;
A hotline for tackling CSAM (i.e. receiving, analysing, and processing reports of such material). Closer cooperation with law enforcement and the private sector should be further explored.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Provide a range of support solutions and innovative digital tools for engineers, technicians and operators on the factory floor, in order to build agile, sustainable and responsive production environment and supply chains, with specific focus on areas such as material saving, repair, refurbishing, re-manufacturing, recycling, and reuse of products and components;
Reduction of the dependency from imported raw materials or harmful materials for the European manufacturing sector (e.g. by material consumption reduction, material substitution and use of secondary raw materials);
Define specifications and standards for data, products, and/or business processes, that can be agreed and commonly used by many industrial actors and across different industry sectors; and facilitate industry agreements on circularity and sustainability through increased data exchange among value chain actors and enable the development of new types of businesses;
Reduce the skills and knowledge gap for the actors involved.
Scope:
The focus is on developing new concepts, methods, and digital tools to support further engineering of the industrial processes for recycling, re-manufacturing, refurbishing, and reuse of manufactured products and components. New solutions will enable remanufacturing and high-quality recycling by digitalisation of product and component information throughout the whole product lifecycle, in line with the 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan.
Another challenge that falls within this scope is the human dimension. The support tools need to work with the user, and training, knowledge transfer, cognitive interfaces, as well as acceptance and uptake will be vital in the solutions proposed.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Development of innovative concepts, methods, and tools that track and trace the status of relevant manufactured products and components, such as electronic systems and components as well as machine tools, and increase transparency and accountability for these along their lifecycle. Where appropriate, proposals need to be able to link up with manufacturing industrial data spaces platforms, so that circular economy data can be shared with a larger set of organisations;

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Deploy the concept of Industrial-Urban Symbiosis (I-US) on a real scale demonstrator, making the flow of solid waste circular in process, manufacturing and/or construction industries;
Reduce 80 % (in weight or volume) solid waste generated in comparison to current state-of-the art, by re-using, valorising and transforming waste, by-products and side-streams into new/secondary resources of raw materials;
Plan actions (e.g. awareness of circularity potential) to overcome non-technological barriers for exploitation (i.e. waste regulations, standardisation, confidentiality and compliance, ownership, fair sharing of benefits, acceptance of the concept);
Develop knowledge sharing: know-how, advantages, challenges and recommendations on technological and non-technological aspects (e.g. job profile optimisation) with the European Community of Practice (ECoP) and other relevant bodies, disseminating the major innovation outcomes to support the implementation of I-US;
Explore and illustrate replication potential in other regions (e.g. by setting up a network amongst waste associations to optimise flow of secondary raw materials);
Implement actions to facilitate relations and to involve the local community actors (authorities, associations, civil society, relevant businesses, especially SMEs, educational organisations, etc.), e.g. exchanging knowledge, training, human capital, contributing to the optimisation of job profiles and sharing with the local educational establishments and with the ECoP;
Implement a social innovation spin-off action[1] involving one of the local community actors.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
Hubs for circularity for solid waste in urban environment tackles a fundamental issue of end of life materials representing a huge amount and broad range of solid wastes. Solid waste are intended here as process industry, manufacturing industry, construction industry waste and solid urban waste (consumer waste, End-of-Life waste). Solid waste in general is one of the biggest waste streams in Europe, accounting for more than 30% of all waste generated in the EU (Dec.2019 data)[2], re-using and re-cycling most of that could cut significantly the emissions caused by the mining and manufacturing needed to produce those materials in the first place and as such represents an important decarbonisation potential. There is a need of innovative solution engaging waste management actors in novel value chains to valorise a significant part of those wastes, bringing full attention to upcycling back to secondary materials instead of down cycling of low re-use.
Projects are expected to address:
Management and processing of waste streams through e.g. collection, disassembly, sorting, purification, refining, concentration, processing (e.g. thermal, mechanical), recycling technologies (especially chemical recycling), exchanging or preparation, for the valorisation of waste to be used as feedstock for other plants and companies across sectors and/or across value chains;
Process (re-)design and adaptation to build a new circular value chain including energy, water and material flow, infrastructure and logistics;
Investigate the availability and distribution of “waste” resources and logistic to ensure proper input of the specified material of the right quality and quantity to feed the new process in time;
Integration of novel sensing technology, IoT and digital tools for the classification and sorting of solid waste streams to enable their efficient utilisation with as little downgrading as possible;
New approach to end-of life materials removing the usual barriers of exploitation, enabling novel symbiotic interactions; unification of administration procedures, data sharing and preservation of data confidentiality;
Define assessment methodologies and evaluate KPIs to measure the performance of symbiosis (SRL) and including environmental, economic and social impacts; ;
Life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis should take into account existing sustainability standards (e.g. ISO 14000) and existing best practices;
Assessment of the economic, circularity and climate benefits;
Study social aspects of the community and its improvement through I-US where demonstration is located, whilst also considering a gender and inclusiveness perspective;
Create societal awareness through a participative approach locally and more broadly, highlighting and communicating political and regulatory obstacle between regions/countries.
Connect to the ECoP for knowledge sharing: know-how, challenges and recommendations on technological and non-technological aspects;
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this call and others in Horizon Europe, with European initiatives (as for example: Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and European Circular Economy Stakeholder Panel (ECESP)), as well as building on existing projects,[3] are strongly encouraged; see also Industrial Symbiosis Report of March 2020[4].

Renewable energy technologies will be evermore present in the lives of European citizens, thus a harmonious co-existence is essential. Wind turbines are particularly susceptible to the NIMBY effect (Not In My BackYard), and hence it is facing opposition despite being a high-potential clean energy source. In order to achieve the European goals on climate neutrality, dedicated actions in this context are needed to ensure that large turbines retain a low environmental impact and gain more popular support. A particular focal point should be how to best engage with different communities to identify actions toward the co-existence goal.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Develop and promote the use of modelling tools and objective holistic assessment metrics for realistic in-depth analysis of cumulative impacts of wind installations on the environment and on local communities;
Develop guidelines to enhance energy citizenship[1]of (onshore or offshore) wind energy and farms, promoting a harmonious co-existence between the local population, other sectors (e.g. fishing communities, tourism) and the wind farms;
Realise outreach activities to promote social awareness and engagement on wind energy, and develop guidelines for participatory processes in wind farm development to reach interactive and mutually value-enhancing outcomes;
Facilitate both the identification of future areas for deployment, notably of offshore wind farms, and the consenting process.
Scope:
The proposal is expected to address all the following aspects:
Develop and promote the use of validated models and guidelines as a tool for enhanced societal engagement. Further, it should also demonstrate how participatory processes can enhance value creation and achieve higher social acceptability of wind energy;
Assess through validated models how wind turbines impact the local environment (noise, impact on soil or sea beds, visual effect, effects on animal life and other species). In addition, it should also assess, if applicable, how offshore wind turbines (and fixed or floating substructures) impact the local marine environment (currents, waves, upwelling, and sediment transport). Finally, it should help to identify the best areas for deployment and to develop new designs and/or enhanced control strategies of wind turbines to address potential impacts;
Develop a forum where regulators, industry, and local communities can exchange information and provide input to one another. Further, it should also identify the effect that the implemented models have on promoting wind energy;
Address how the impact of different wind energy innovations and applications (onshore, offshore, floating, and airborne) is seen by the general public and the local actors.
This topic requires the effective contribution of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Demonstrate a modular design suited to large-scale deployment in various environments, with special focus on industrial mass production;
Ensure minimal environmental impact of these innovations, and address how Maritime Spatial Planning can be used to facilitate the identification and optimal use of suitable locations for floating wind platforms.
The proposal has to include a clear go/no go moment ahead of entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go moment, the project will have to deliver the detailed engineering plans, a complete business and implementation plan and all needed permits for the deployment of the project. The proposal is expected to clearly demonstrate a proposed pathway to obtaining necessary permits for the demonstration actions and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The proposal is expected to also demonstrate how it will get a financial close[2] for the whole action. Independent experts will assess all deliverables and will advise for the go/no-go decision.
The proposal should take a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder approach, to ensure that different viewpoints and interests are taken into account in development and deployment processes and to help avoid foreseeable externalities. Thus, it requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities

The cost-effective integration of advanced biofuel technologies in existing industrial plants will contribute to increase the competitiveness of these technologies and overcome the costly scaling-up of advanced biofuel production which requires heavy new infrastructure and investments and impedes their capacity building. It will thus allow high penetration of advanced biofuels in the transport energy system, in particular for hard to electrify sectors like aviation and maritime. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Reduce capital and operational expenses (CAPEX and OPEX) of advanced biofuel production facilities.
De-risk technology, boost scale-up of advanced biofuels and contribute to their market up-take.
Contribute to the priorities of the SET Plan Action 8.
Respond to short and medium term needs for renewable fuels in transport.
Create win-win solutions for advanced biofuel production and conventional industrial phasing out plants, e.g., first generation biofuels, associated with socio-economic benefits.
Scope:
Proposals should demonstrate cost-efficient advanced biofuel technologies which improve the economic viability of the advanced biofuel production. This should be done through innovative transformation of existing plants to incorporate production of advanced biofuels from non-food/feed sustainable biomass feedstock into existing processes, e.g., first generation biofuel plants, paper mill industry, waste treatment plants, oil-refineries, petrochemical industry, etc. Integration of advanced biofuel processing should be done with new and innovative installations and it should be optimized implementing a circularity approach for energy and material, as well as digitalization as appropriate, e.g. by using sensors, smarter equipment, algorithms etc., to increase the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and performance of the final plant. Economic advantages in terms of both capital and operational expenditure for commercialization of advanced biofuels through transformation, as well as socio-economic benefits for phasing-out industries including the impact on current first generation biofuel sites should be addressed. Proposals should provide information about the expected economic improvements and the potential of full transformation to advanced biofuel plants as appropriate. All demonstrators should be fully and transparently documented, to ensure replicability, up-scaling and to assist future planning decisions.

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Contribution to IPBES and IPCC, to the achievement of objectives of reaching net zero carbon emissions, enhancing climate change adaptation, and to the EU Biodiversity Strategy.
Support the implementation of the Horizon Europe Mission on Adaptation to climate change including societal transformation.
Identify low cost/benefit ratio options to restore natural and semi-natural ecosystems for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation.
Assess the value of restoring ecosystem for adaptation to and/or mitigation of climate change and identify potential rebound effects and trade-offs.
Demonstrate the degree to which these approaches are affected by climate change itself and if they can still be effective under global warming of 2°C and higher.
Demonstrate the potential contribution of European abandoned land and protected areas systems for carbon sequestration, adaptation to and/or mitigation of climate change.
Develop strategies to minimize the increasing risk of wildfires due to the changing climate.
Provide operational methods for low cost, low human intervention options for ecosystems restoration optimising the contributions to climate and biodiversity objectives and managing trade-offs.
Help generate FAIR[1]data and well-documented, robust and transparent methodologies for better integration of land-use management systems into IAMs and ESMs.
Assess the perception and acceptability of citizens and stakeholders on rewilding and rewilding options and identify potential conflicts and trade-offs in governance and decision-making.
Scope:
The biodiversity crisis and the climate crisis are intrinsically linked and the contribution of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) to the global climate objectives is pivotal. A better understanding of how the use of ecosystems natural capacity, with minimal help from humans, can contribute to carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation is urgently needed to make the use of NBS operational.
Actions should foster interdisciplinary research with a focus on the climate-biodiversity nexus, advancing our knowledge to further promote integrated approaches to better address these interdependent challenges.
Actions, taking stock of previous and ongoing experience, including associated uncertainty, should provide a robust assessment of the potential contribution that restoring ecosystems, including trophic chains restoration, with a “let nature do the job”, also called “rewilding”, approach can provide in terms of carbon sequestration and storage, climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity conservation. “Rewilding” is meant here as passive management of ecological succession with the goal of restoring natural ecosystem processes and reducing human control of landscapes, although some intervention may be required in the early restoration stages.
Actions can address specific ecosystems and/or landscapes on land, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems while providing a clear contribution to define the potential use of the “rewilding” approach at regional, national and continental levels.
Actions should build on an updated and detailed picture of the status and trends of ecosystems change, (including, where applicable, land abandonment) in Europe to assess where, at which ecological conditions and at what scale the “rewilding” approach can significantly improve carbon sequestration together with habitats reinforcement and biodiversity conservation.
Actions should investigate how “rewilding” can be complemented with other approaches (for example active restoration and conservation, low intensity farming, forestry and pasture management, fishing), taking into account specific regional conditions, to increase carbon sequestration, improve biodiversity conservation and ensure provision of goods and ecosystem services.
Actions should provide scientific insights, tools, methodologies and innovative solutions including social innovations to assist national governments, regions and communities in embedding the “rewilding” approach, as far as feasible, in their own plans to reach carbon neutrality. Actions should also advance the integration of land use options for carbon sequestration into IAMs and ESMs.
Actions should significantly advance knowledge on the role and relevance of restoring fully functional trophic chains, for instance through the conservation, management and reintroduction of apex predators, grazers and scavengers, in the “rewilding” process, with a special focus on the functioning of trophic cascades on landscape processes and the ability of ecosystems to act as carbon sinks. Challenges and barriers to this aim should be analysed and the involvement of Social Sciences and Humanities is recommended.
Actions should ensure appropriate multi-stakeholder collaboration and interdisciplinarity to embed socio-economic aspects, including opportunities for economic development, existing barriers (ecological, social, gender-related…) and potential synergies and drawbacks.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant actions, initiatives and programmes, including Horizon 2020 and the LIFE Programme to promote synergies, integration and co-operation. They should make use and contribute to knowledge exchange and networking European platforms (e.g. Climate-ADAPT, Network Nature, OPPLA, BiodivERsA). Cooperation and planning for further exploitation of actions results during and after the project end is strongly encouraged.
Synergies should be ensured with projects addressing wildfires (for example under the EU Green Deal call LC-GD-1-1-2020, Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 5).

Increased citizen engagement.
Reduction of LCOE approaching SET Plan targets (actions should clearly justify the estimated LCOE at project start and end).
Scope:
High-temperature underground thermal energy storage (HT-UTES) covers the 25-90°C temperature range, and the targets of interest can reach up to 2000 m in depth. The development of UTES is linked to a multidisciplinary understanding of the whole system, including waste-heat source, exploration and subsurface characterisation, production, implementation and distribution systems, as well as the adaptation of the regulatory framework and social acceptance. The main technical challenges are the adaptation of the return temperature from the surface site to the subsurface temperature and to the regulatory frameworks, identification, characterisation and monitoring the reservoirs for UTES, the geo-mechanical effects of the reservoir linked to the seasonal injection/ production operations related to pressure and temperature changes, hydrogeochemical problems associated with scaling and corrosion of the piping system, circular design and optimisation of the distribution network.
The proposal is expected to:
Develop and demonstrate appropriate control systems and infrastructure to manage geothermal heat and electricity production, heat demand and storage connected to the installation.
Use the flexibility of geothermal reservoirs as thermal energy storage systems and flexibility in the network coping with daily, weekly and seasonal variations in heat demand.
Demonstrate the innovative technologies in at least 2 different plants with different characteristics.

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In supporting the implementation of the Green Deal, the EU 2030 biodiversity strategy and the Birds and Habitats Directives, successful proposals will contribute to increasing and transferring local taxonomic knowledge, innovation and expertise across Europe, in particular for endangered species and other relevant groups of species, to better understand and address biodiversity decline, its main direct drivers and their interrelations.
Successful proposals must address all the following outcomes:
Increased local taxonomic knowledge and expertise across Europe, in particular for endangered species and other species groups of particular interest, through a network of expert trainers.
National reference collections for pollinators (bee, butterfly, moth and hoverfly specimens).
Better taxonomic research capacity and reinforced digital networking, in particular near biodiversity hotspots and for protected areas, and access to materials, resources, advice, and professional expertise and infrastructures from museums and other taxonomic facilities, such as botanical gardens, herbaria, natural history collections, and biodiversity research centres.
New taxonomy methods and technologies are put to use and tested in situ, in particular, generation of reference datasets linking DNA data and voucher specimens, and identification methodologies and digital applications, including 2D and 3D specimen digitalization. Knowledge and tools are generated and shared among central and local taxonomy nodes in the network, as well as with citizen scientists and end-users worldwide.
Strategic opportunities to promote integrative taxonomy in professional careers and academic curricula are identified. Pilot actions to address the current shortage of taxonomists are initiated.
Scope:
Professional taxonomists are highly specialised and skilled experts, traditionally working in academia or curating collections in natural history museums, herbaria, botanical garden or biobanks. European collections hold and document 80% of the worlds’ described biodiversity. Today, this expertise is increasingly required by decision-makers at local and regional levels to plan and implement conservation efforts, establish protected areas, combat invasive species, sustainably manage forests, fields and seas, and many other aspects of ecological, economic and societal importance. There are millions of species still undescribed and there are far too few taxonomists to do the job: global biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate because of human activities, and, paradoxically, many species are disappearing at the same rate to the decline of the number of experts who are able to document that disappearance.
EU Member States and associated countries, often lack permanent taxonomic capacity in the field, in particular near biodiversity hotspots and protected areas. They could greatly benefit from professional expertise, networking and infrastructures from natural history museums and other taxonomic facilities, such as botanical gardens or biobanks, and centres integrating new genome- and image-based technologies to advance taxonomy, contributing at the same time with adequate in situ conservation monitoring, data and samples.
Building on expert findings and recommendations, the taxonomic network should develop a plan to strengthen taxonomic expertise in Europe, promote taxonomy and its applications in official curricula and businesses, and develop plans for international cooperation. Expert taxonomy trainers across Europe[1] should train a network of ‘followers’, by creating simple-to-use identification guides and methodologies, training programmes, online tools and activities adapted to local needs and resources (by area and by taxa of particular importance, such as endemic, locally-threatened species, those in the Red List, or intra-specific diversity). The strategy of promoting integrative taxonomy should also account of the publication gap in taxonomic journals, discouraging specialists in academic competitions. For example, strategies should encourage the engagement of taxonomists in wide ecological research projects, and identify relevant opportunities in the private sector, securing their career development. The project should also lead with guidance, resources and expertise to establish or improve national reference collections for pollinators in all European countries (bee, butterfly, moth, and hoverfly and beetle specimens), as well as for soil fauna (mites, springtails, woodlices, millipedes and earthworms) and freshwater taxa including invasive alien species in all European countries. This should be carried out in collaboration with projects resulting from topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-02: ‘Data and technologies for the inventory, fast identification and monitoring of endangered wildlife and other species groups’.
The network should also support, guide and supervise the establishment of adequate facilities in a pilot number of local nodes (such as wet labs, connected computer data nodes and remote communications). For this purpose, proposals can include financial support to third parties in the form of grants. A maximum of EUR 200 000 per third party could be granted. The consortium need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support will be granted. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose.
Successful proposals should also promote the effective development of European infrastructures, such as LifeWatch ERIC, the future DiSSCo’s digitalised collections, or eLTER, and application of advanced taxonomic technologies (such as eDNA, genomics, AI).
The action should also seek to involve amateur taxonomists, reach for citizen scientists with tools and networks, produce/update a strategic mapping and agenda for taxonomic expertise in Europe, and identify gaps and needs for future actions. Gender aspects should be addressed both in amateur and professional taxonomy communities and the biogeographical approach needs to be taken into account.

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims to support the development of policies, business models and market conditions to scale up and speed up the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS)[1]. It will contribute to deploying NBS more widely and to fully reaping their economic, social and environmental benefits in order to build a competitive sustainability in Europe and to tackle climate change. NBS contribute to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and other Green Deal priorities, by supporting biodiversity and vital ecosystem services: climate change mitigation and improving carbon sinks, biomass provision, access to fresh water, clean soil, healthy diets and lifestyles and sustainable food systems. Deploying NBS will also create green jobs and build resilience to climate change and natural disasters.
Successful proposals must contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Broad and effective community of innovators in the EU and associated countries, practitioners and developers of NBS – including but not limited to Horizon 2020/Horizon Europe projects – engaged across communities of science, business, policy and practice, and from local to global level;
Better engagement, with public authorities, private sector and society at large for implementing and investing in NBS;
Establish European NBS “quality brand” with an underlying, comprehensive and agreed vision and agenda, to position and promote EU excellence in NBS innovation;
Improve cooperation and synergies with key strategic international partners and collaboration with CEN/CENELEC to develop European and international standards and foster the emergence of a global market for NBS;
Consolidate NBS knowledge across sectors and disciplines through regional and Europe-wide transdisciplinary collaboration, advisory services, awareness raising, knowledge transfer and skills development.
Scope:
Nature-based solutions (NBS) deliver multiple ecosystem services to address diverse societal challenges with a systemic and innovative approach. An effective multi-stakeholder platform is needed to support and consolidate the understanding of NBS and to promote their use and speed up market up-take and wider implementation.
Such a platform enables: a) dialogue, interactions, knowledge and information sharing; b) integration of EU project results and platforms; and c) collaboration and think-and-do-tanks among relevant stakeholders (science, public administration, professional organizations, businesses and investors, civil society).
NetworkNature[2], a CSA funded under Horizon 2020’s Societal Challenge 5 (WP 2019) that is due to end in 2022, is in the process of creating this platform. The Oppla[3] portal is developing the underlying EU NBS knowledge repository, supporting access, sharing NBS knowledge more widely, including from EU-funded NBS projects, to already engaged and new target audiences, such as the finance and investment sector and the wider public.
This topic aims to maintain and build upon the achievements of NetworkNature and Oppla. The successful proposal should further develop and consolidate an engaged, broad and effective European community of innovators, practitioners and developers to promote the design, deployment, out- and up-scaling of NBS at the European and global scale, while recognising regional and national specificities, contexts and needs.
The successful proposal should undertake continuous and strategically driven stakeholder dialogue and facilitate sharing of practice, experience and expertise related to all NBS-relevant aspects, across multiple scales and sectors. Actions should cover social, economic, financial, environmental, educational, institutional, regulatory and cultural aspects; in particular:
Improve engagement, strengthened ties and new partnerships with public authorities, the private and financing sector and society at large to implement and invest in NBS, based on a high level of awareness about their advantages in order to widen the uptake of these solutions;
Maintain and further develop an online open source stakeholder platform that facilitates the interactions within and between NBS knowledge holders and implementers;
Identify, evaluate, standardise and gather tools, mechanisms and advisory services that support different actors in NBS in a one-stop-shop, aiming at supplying offers to match the needs which are brought forward;
Build on NetworkNature's business plan, to make such a platform financially self-sustainable by the end of the project, and emphasise payback models and payable advisory services;
Maintain and support established NBS hubs and establish new ones; support and advise on communication and outreach campaigns and regular events in all Member States, involving international networks and environmental communicators and targeting all relevant stakeholders involved in the NBS value chain, including the scientific community;
Develop a ready-to-use communication toolbox in all EU official languages for regional and local authorities to better communicate about NBS and their benefits, namely in terms of economic growth and job creation;
Facilitate the clustering of current and upcoming EU-funded NBS relevant research and innovation projects and promote the uptake of their results in further EU or national initiatives (e.g. in projects resulting from the LIFE programme or cohesion policy);
Assist the Commission in organising science-policy workshops and assessing the contribution of NBS to global and EU policies, notably related to the EU Green Deal. These include biodiversity, pollution, climate adaptation and mitigation, water, agriculture and forestry, as well as urban and regional development, health, transformative change and just transitions;
Facilitate the development of guidelines for practitioners with state-of-the-art NBS design practices and protocols; Collaborate with CEN/CENELEC to develop European standards, making sure these guidelines are accessible to all users;
Help to the develop and mainstream NBS-related professional training and include it in primary, secondary and higher-education curricula[4];
Develop mechanisms for capacity building and knowledge sharing across disciplines, the involving EU and MS/AC-wide professional organisations. Include partner organisations across EU Member States to ease dissemination of NBS knowledge at local and Europe-wide level ;
Promote international cooperation with key strategic partners and sharing best practice, in particular with – but not limited to –Latin American and Caribbean countries, the USA and Africa;
Support a dialogue between cities implementing NBS (e.g. through twinning, peer exchanges, etc.) to encourage NBS knowledge sharing, experience exchange and access to best practices in the Member States; and establish links with other networking initiatives such as ICLEI, or the Covenant of Mayors;
Further develop and maintain existing databases of facts and figures on NBS cost-effectiveness, including in monetised form, and according to NBS typology and challenges addressed by NBS, for improved communication and outreach;
Identify specific areas and priorities where further research and innovation and educational development are needed to more widely implement, exploit benefits and market acceptance of NBS.
The proposals must address all of the above points and should ensure that all evidence and information will be accessible through the Oppla portal (the EU repository for NBS)[3].
Applicants should create links with projects under the same topic and other relevant ongoing or up-coming projects, notably the Horizon 2020 NBS project portfolio and its task forces; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-05: The economics of nature-based solutions: cost-benefit analysis, market development and funding’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-06: Nature-based solutions, prevention and reduction of risks and the insurance sector’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-05: Assessing the socio-politics of nature-based solutions for more inclusive and resilient communities’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-02-02-two-stage: Developing nature-based therapy for health and well-being’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-06: Inside and outside: educational innovation with nature-based solutions’. To this end, proposals should include specific tasks and sufficient resources for coordination measures, envisage joint activities and joint deliverables.
Collaboration with the Biodiversity Partnership (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) is expected in the context of strengthening the knowledge base for assessing, developing and deploying nature-based solutions.

","15 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the objectives of the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies, successful proposals will promote diversification in agriculture as a means to increase the resilience of the sector vis-a-vis variable environmental, climatic and economic conditions. By promoting biodiversity, proposals will address consumer demands for more diversified and sustainable production in agriculture.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Integration of knowledge from diverse disciplines (e.g. ecology, agronomy, genetics, physiology as well as social sciences) to better understand, assess and use ecological processes which underpin the multiple benefits arising from intercropping;
Better understand the barriers for the adoption of intercropping by farmers;
Optimised, field-tested and ready-to-use agronomic practices for intercropping applicable to various conditions across Europe;
More wide-spread practical expertise of intercropping amongst advisors and farmers;
Increased evidence and appreciation of the beneficial effects of intercropping on crop quality and product quality along with wider benefits for biodiversity, soil health, water quality and reduced GHG and air pollution emissions;
Demonstration of the economic avenues and benefits of diversified production for the farming sector and related value chains.
In the long(er) term:
More sustainable, biodiverse and resilient farming ensuring the continued delivery of a larger range of food and non-food products along with multiple ecosystems services;
Stronger links between the various operators in value chains and increased economic avenues for the farming sector;
Better appreciation by the wider public of the benefits of intercropping and diversification in general.
Scope:
Farmers face increasing pressure to shift production towards lower input systems, while continuing to ensure sufficient supplies of food and non-food products. The Green Deal in particular has set ambitious targets to reduce by 2030 the overall use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers, reduce nutrient losses and increase organic farming[1].
Species rich production systems such as intercropping[2] have shown significant potential to increase resource efficiency and resilience against biotic and abiotic stresses, thereby allowing to deliver yield gains without increased inputs, or stabilise yields with decreased inputs. Diversified farming systems making use of strategic intercrops can also improve soil health and deliver multiple ecosystem services.
The benefits of intercropping are the result of highly dynamic interactions between plants and their environment and allow to optimise the use of resources such as nutrients, water or solar radiation. Despite these benefits, intercropping is not widely applied in European agriculture, due e.g. to an increased complexity of operations and labour intensity at farm level or a market pulls for more standardised products and processing as well as for simplified modes of marketing,
Activities should:
Study the (context specific) mechanisms that underpin the benefits associated with intercropping such as enhanced resource efficiency, disease and pest avoidance and product quality;
Elucidate the links between above- and below-ground species interactions and how these could be optimised through management;
Provide evidence on the effects of intercropping on product quality down the value chain;
Identify, test and demonstrate agronomic practices that promote benefits from intercropping by optimising the interactions between plants, environment and management (G x G x E x M) , including the use of inputs and adapted machinery such as precision tools;
Explore farmers’ the motivation to adopt intercropping practices and propose solutions to overcome potential barriers;
Promote the uptake of intercropping through the development of guidelines and wide-spread practical demonstrations taking into account a range of farming systems, pedo-climatic conditions and value chains;
Identify and test avenues for marketing and processing of more diverse farming outputs across the value chain.
Result of activities should benefit both conventional and organic agriculture. International co-operation is strongly encouraged in particular with countries where intercropping is more widely applied, yet would benefit from further optimisation.
Activities must implement the multi-actor approach, thus ensure an adequate involvement of advisors, farmers, other players in the value chain and consumers. Communication and outreach to a wide range of stakeholders is essential.
This topic should include the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
Proposals should specify how they plan to collaborate with other proposals selected under this and other relevant topics, e.g. by undertaking joint activities, workshops or common communication and dissemination activities. Proposals should allocate the necessary resources to cover these activities.

In keeping with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 the successful proposal is expected to contribute to measuring and integrating the value of nature into public and business decision making at all levels for the protection and restoration of ecosystems and their services.
Successful proposals will contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Change the way in which EU and associated countries organizations and companies allocate capital or influence their activities to promote a sustainable management by mainstreaming the use of corporate natural capital accounting.
Integrate biodiversity and ecosystem considerations into business decision-making at different levels by measuring the biodiversity footprint of products and organisations through improving, developing and implementing standardised methods, criteria and standards that focus on essential features of biodiversity, ecosystems services, values, and sustainable use.
Improve corporate biodiversity disclosure through innovative approaches to foster principles of biodiversity data transparency to accurately report on biodiversity, ecosystems and services.
Demonstrate innovative solutions for valuing business impacts and dependencies in biodiversity and ecosystem and how this ends up in risks and opportunities for businesses private decision-making.
Explore solutions to decrease the biodiversity footprint of retailers in global value chains.
Scope:
The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 recognises that biodiversity considerations need to be better integrated into public and business decision-making at all levels. This should include measuring the environmental footprint of products and organisations on the environment, through life-cycle approaches complemented and eventually integrated by natural capital accounting. In this context, the Commission will support the establishment of an international natural capital accounting initiative.
Natural capital accounting has potential in providing a meaningful basis for business performance reporting by explicitly mapping out impacts and/or dependencies on natural resources and placing a monetary value on them. Specific examples include business accounting and reporting and the disclosure of non-financial reporting and accounting directives.
The successful proposal should develop, take up or demonstrate in real settings standardised natural capital accounting practices to support companies to measure, value and synthetise biodiversity and ecosystem risks assessment, notably in a way that is suitable for routine consideration in business and economy decision-making (including at executive level). It should also mainstream environmental footprints methods for instance through quantifying the environmental impacts of products, or supply and value chains, business models or organisations based the Commission Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) and the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF).
The successful proposal should contribute to the alignment of natural capital accounting between the public and private sectors and to explore how the links to link the collection and use of statistics and data for natural capital accounting. It should also address the obstacles businesses are facing, in particular on data collection and improving the access and utility of European environmental data sets at different levels (i.e.: national statistical offices, environmental agencies, corporate reports) allowing better corporate and national data integration for economic and financial decision making.
The successful proposal should work on methodologies for companies to set science-based biodiversity targets. It should also address the specific decision-making needs of corporates and financial service provider to allow a specific and meaningful linkage with the macro-economic perspective and the ecological concept of planetary boundaries at the scale of decision to be taken at corporate level enabling to assess and understand to corporate safe operating space.
The successful proposal should develop and test concrete natural capital accounting and reporting frameworks for business performance with respect to biodiversity and ecosystem services reporting. This should include explicit mapping of the impacts and/or dependencies on natural resources and placing a monetary value on them. Specific examples should include business accounting, reporting, and the disclosure of non-financial reporting.
The successful proposal should explore to which extent the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting / Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EEA) framework in its current form is useful for natural capital assessment and natural capital accounting by businesses. This should be done both in terms of methodological approach and data collection o the opportunities for adapting the SEEA EEA framework to make it more tailored to the business needs or the extent to which national statistical offices can benefit from data collection by businesses.
The successful proposal should develop and test concrete natural capital accounting basis for business performance on biodiversity and ecosystem services reporting by explicitly mapping out impacts and/or dependencies on natural resources and placing a monetary value on them. Specific examples should include business accounting, reporting, and the disclosure of non-financial reporting.
The successful proposal should support the European contribution to a globally consistent approach to account for ecosystems and their value. The proposal should ensure that the EU continues to play a lead role in international environmental affairs through its support for effective measures, international standards and accounting relating to natural capital.
The successful proposal should improve the access and utility of European environmental data sets at different levels (i.e: national statistical offices, environmental agencies, corporate reports) allowing better corporate and national data integration for economic and financial decision making.
The successful proposal should support developing and testing natural capital and biodiversity based business models. These are expected to invest in nature for the benefit of biodiversity, ecosystems functioning and ecosystem services and address the challenge to turn the value of ecosystem into a revenue stream. The successful proposal should help making natural capital and biodiversity based business models bankable, thereby enabling private investments in nature conservation. In other words, ‘how to facilitate making money with nature by enhancing ecosystem conditions but not by exploiting it to the detriment of nature’.
The successful proposal should therefore take stock and establish links with the work undertaken by ongoing initiatives, European and national platforms on business and biodiversity, the Natural Capital Protocol, Value balancing alliance, the Knowledge Innovation Project KIP INCA and other Horizon 2020 related projects[1].
The successful proposal should support the practical implementation of corporate reporting obligations such as under the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU)[2] or of the EU Taxonomy on Sustainable Finance.
Applicants should create synergies with relevant projects under this call (‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-07: Ecosystems and their services for an evidence-based policy and decision-making’; ‘HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-17: Policy mixes, governance (including financing) and decision-making tools for transformative action for biodiversity’ the EU Biodiversity Partnership and the Science Service. To this end, proposals should include specific tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, and, where possible, envisage joint activities and joint deliverables.
The proposal should set practical policy recommendations for the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 targets and commitments. Proposals should contribute to strategic dialogue with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity forum and ensure that all evidence, results, data and information will be accessible and interoperable with the KCBD[3].

In line with the objectives of the 2030 biodiversity strategy and other policies such as the common agricultural policy (CAP), successful proposals will contribute to the take up of practices in agriculture that promote biodiversity as well as to effective monitoring of farmland biodiversity to maintain and re-establish biotopes and habitats.
Projects should address all of the following outcomes:
Methods and tools for a systematic monitoring of in situ biodiversity of agricultural areas, considering above ground and soil biodiversity;
Enhanced methods and indicators to evaluate the impact of agricultural practices and in particular CAP agri-environment measures or ecoschemes on above and below ground biodiversity;
Increased access to information on carbon- and nature-rich areas;
More effective farm advisory systems in relation to biodiversity issues and providing special advice for farmers including those operating in Natura 2000 sites
In the longer term:
More effective agri-environment measures, improving both above- and below ground biodiversity in agricultural areas along with an increased uptake of agroforestry measures under rural development programmes.
Scope:
The EU biodiversity strategy 2030 underlines the role of farmers in preserving biodiversity while at the same time indicating that certain agricultural practices are a key driver for biodiversity decline.
According to the latest State of Nature Report (EEA, 2020), many terrestrial habitats are severely impacted by agriculture, especially grasslands and freshwater habitats, heath and scrub, and bogs, mires and fens playing important role in soil carbon sequestration. This is also the case for most of the species groups, including reptiles, molluscs, amphibians, arthropods, vascular plants and breeding birds.
Grasslands as one of the most species-rich habitats in Europe, are among the habitats with the highest share of assessments showing a bad conservation status (49 %), accompanied by deteriorating soil properties.
Farmland birds and insects, particularly pollinators, and soil microbiota are key indicators of the health of agroecosystems and are vital for agricultural production and food security. The biodiversity strategy aims to bring back at least 10% of agricultural area under high-diversity landscape features. These include, amongst others buffer strips, rotational or non-rotational fallow land, hedges, non-productive trees, terrace walls, and ponds. Such measures help enhance carbon sequestration, prevent soil erosion and depletion, filter air and water, and support climate adaptation.
The EU Birds and Habitats Directive aims at reaching favourable conservation status of wild birds as well as of those species and habitats covered in the annexes of the Habitats Directive. However, there are many data gaps to identify species’ requirements and to monitor population trends over time for those species dependent on agricultural habitats. This hampers the design of appropriate agro-ecological conservation measures and the proper implementation of the Directives. It is therefore necessary to monitor the diversity and area of habitats for farmland-dependent species, in space and time, in order to maintain and re-establish biotopes and habitats.
Projects should:
Map carbon and nature rich areas and analyse the effects of agricultural practices on biodiversity;
Monitor the diversity and area of habitats for farmland-dependent species, in space and time;
Develop and test effective agri-environment measures as well as indicators and monitoring tools to determine the effectiveness of conservation measures for species and their habitats in the agricultural context;
Develop and demonstrate practical examples of agro-forestry systems and how these can be promoted through rural development programmes.
Activities should be carried across a range of climatic/biogeographical regions in the EU and Associated Countries.
The project needs to take account of already existing European species action plans, such as the Turtle Dove action plan and the EU Wet Grassland Wader action plan. Furthermore, cooperation is expected with the Biodiversity Partnership and other relevant Horizon Europe missions and partnerships.

","06 October 2021
","21 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 “Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care”. More specifically, this topic aims at supporting activities that are contributing to some of the following expected impacts:
Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally. Health promotion and disease prevention will be at their heart, by shifting from hospital-centred to community-based, people-centred and integrated health care structures and successfully embedding technological innovations that meet public health needs, while patient safety and quality of services is increased.
Health policy and systems adopt a holistic approach (individuals, communities, organisations, society) for the evaluation of health outcomes and value of public health interventions, the organisation of health care, and decision-making.
To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
Decision and policymakers in the field of health care avail of new approaches to financial planning and financing mechanisms that provide flexibility to stretched health budgets, including alternative procurement and contractual methods;
Decision and policymakers in the field of health care apply cost-effective spending strategies based on the optimisation of the use of resources, while maintaining or improving health outcomes in an equitable way;
Decision and policymakers in the field of health care access tools that enable them to better remunerate, contract and incentivise health care professionals and providers;
Decision and policymakers in the field of health care take evidence-based and socially equitable health care financial decisions.
Scope:
In 2017, spending on health care in the EU stood at 9.6% of gross domestic product, ranging from over 11% in France and Germany to less than 6% in Romania. In most countries, in-patient care services made up the bulk of health spending, while spending on pharmaceuticals also accounted for a large share of health expenditure in some countries.[1]
Due to demographic changes in the EU with a population projected to continue ageing and higher expectations regarding provision of health care services, public health threats with relevant repercussions for society and the introduction of innovative and digital solutions to improve health care systems’ functioning, the demand for health care services as well as the budgetary pressures on health care systems are and will keep increasing.
Future models of care delivery will have to take into account both the systemic and multi-dimensional performance perspective and to look at relevant outcome and quality indicators, structure of care delivery, and knowledge base regarding optimal care delivery systems,
Therefore, research and innovation should tackle the challenges of financing health care services in the EU by addressing one or more of the following:
Financing of health care – development of new cost-effective models for financing and reimbursement, including incentive mechanisms and outcome-based financing in order to promote good performance of the health care systems.
Financing of preventive health care – novel models and appropriate structure of financial incentives for effective health promotion and disease prevention, financial incentives for stronger co-operation between primary care and public health services, long-term sustainable financing mechanism for local- and municipality-run promotion programmes and the assessment of personal health risk behaviour and its potential impact on health costs.
Innovative purchasing and contract methods – new strategies for contracting provision of health care services (public sector hired services) as well as solutions to better assess provision capacity and quality, to assess markets, and cost-effectiveness as well as equal access of contracting-out services. This can help align the incentives of providers with those of patients and the public good.
New and improved tools for better design of incentives for health care professionals – incentives that minimise differentiation between services and “cream-skimming” by patients, fostering better health care planning, optimized use of health care services and avoidance of resources’ overconsumption and -waste.
Value-based pricing- and payment models for health technologies are not in the scope of this topic; such models are covered by topic “New pricing and payment models for cost-effective and affordable health innovation” (HORIZON-HLTH-2022-IND-13-03) under destination 6.
Research and innovation in these areas should take into account the potential impact of public health emergencies and threats on the sustainability, financing, as well as the effective and efficient functioning of EU health care systems.
To ensure wide uptake by user communities and scalability of the models and methods across health systems, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, architecture, code and any underlying data.
Applicants are highly encouraged to actively involve public authorities (i.e. ministries of finances and health, procurement agencies/procurers and agencies responsible for the management of health services contracts, public health and health-policy institutes, health administrations, among other) in the proposals.
Projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate, and in particular they are expected to liaise with successful applicants under topic “New pricing and payment models for cost-effective and affordable health innovation” (HORIZON-HLTH-2022-IND-13-03) and the consortium to be created under the planned “European Partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems” (HORIZON-HLTH-CARE-2022-IND-10-01). These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activity without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes specified below:
Public and private procurers in the area of health care deploy at a critical scale, innovative, market-ready solutions (materials, technologies and systems/practices), that are relevant to the preparedness and resilience of health care systems;
European health and technology industry actors (including start-ups/SMEs) bring to the market secure, interoperable digital health care solutions (complying with relevant ethical and privacy protection standards) which are proven to improve health outcomes and access to care for patients;
Procurers facilitate the commercialisation of innovative solutions at a large scale (EU/international) by their successful suppliers through providing them with customer references for the validation and first pilot deployment in multiple countries and health care settings;
Policymakers, health care providers and professionals, patients and their carers – each in their respective areas – exchange and adopt good practices and the best solutions the market can deliver to improve the resilience of health care systems.
Scope:
Public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI) can boost the wider market uptake of high impact innovations in health care systems, while building the capacity of providers and increasing resilience and preparedness in the context of cross-border public health emergencies. This can support the economic recovery of the EU by providing incentives to the EU health and technology industry (especially spin-offs, start-ups and SMEs) to innovate and by providing business opportunities to commercialise innovative products or services at a larger scale than they would normally have. By acting as early adopters of such innovative solutions, procurers can open up new growth markets for the EU industry, thereby contributing to EU growth, employment and competitiveness. At the same time, joint/collaborative demand-side initiatives can help create economies of scale and scale up the wider adoption of innovations by the health sector. Advances in this area can help EU health care systems build resilience and respond to public health threats better than if they would act individually.
The actions supported will target critical-scale deployment of relevant health care solutions across different regions in Europe by engaging public and/or private procurers from each participating country (at national, regional or local level) that have deployment responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area of care or supply of services. Procurers will specify, purchase and deploy solutions addressing their relevant, shared unmet needs, while engaging together in a supply and demand side dialogue, in order for the deployed solutions to deliver sustainable, new or improved health care services and outcomes, always taking into account patient feedback. Specific guidance on PPI actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annex Hof the Horizon Europe work programme.
Proposals should therefore be based on clearly identified user needs and well-structured work plans, explaining how the procurement of the innovative solutions will contribute to the expected outcomes. In addition, proposals should clearly state the benefits of the solutions that will be developed during the course of the project. In this context, applicants should consider aspects of accessibility and affordability of the solution, efficiency of the technology when implemented in the relevant contexts and how it contributes to health systems resilience.
This topic prioritises areas of health care such as health promotion, preparedness, prevention, surveillance and rapid response to cross-border health threats. Promoting coordination, cooperation and common standards in the procurement of innovation in health care (including emergency procurement) should be at the heart of any proposal submitted as well as facilitating the digital and green transition of EU health systems.
Activities covered should include cooperation with policymakers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for the PPI, searching support and collaborating with respective coordination and networking projects. Likewise, awareness raising, technical assistance and/or capacity building beyond the project to mainstream PPI implementation and removing obstacles for introducing the innovative solutions to be procured into the market could be included.
A wide variety of settings are potentially relevant for the implementation of such innovative solutions, for example primary health care settings, hospitals, specialised centres, and long-term health care facilities. The involvement of end-users and the use of cross-sectorial approaches are necessary in the area of health. They can lead to more impactful proposals, especially if combined with cost-effectiveness analyses in comparison with the status quo.
Within this topic, it is possible to foresee the transfer and adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to health care. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different types of innovation.

Fostering the development of such innovative solutions in Europe can reinforce EU strategic autonomy in strategic health technologies and lead to the creation of new markets for the EU industry, thereby contributing to EU growth, employment and competitiveness. At the same time, joint/collaborative demand-side initiatives can help create economies of scale and early adoption of innovations by the health sector. Advances in this area can help EU health care systems build resilience and respond to public health threats better than if they would act individually.
Pre-commercial procurement actions in the area of health care gather relevant public and private procurers to address a common, unmet need through the cross-border public and private procurement of research and development for demand-driven innovative solutions. Specific guidance on PCP actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annex H[1] of the Horizon Europe work programme.
Proposals should therefore be based on clearly identified user needs and well-structured work plans, explaining how the procured research and development will contribute to the expected outcomes. In addition, proposals should clearly state the expected health benefits of the solutions that will be developed during the course of the action. In this context, applicants should also consider aspects of accessibility and affordability of the solution, efficiency of the technology when implemented in the relevant contexts and how it contributes to health systems resilience.
This topic prioritises areas of health care such as health promotion, preparedness, prevention, surveillance and rapid response to cross-border health threats. Promoting coordination, cooperation and common standards in the procurement of innovation in health care (including emergency procurement) should be at the heart of any proposal submitted as well as facilitating the digital and green transition of EU health systems.
A wide variety of settings are potentially relevant for the implementation of such innovative solutions, such as: primary health care settings, ambulatory care, hospitals, specialised centres, and long-term health care facilities. The involvement of end-users and the use of cross-sectorial approaches are essential in the area of health. They can lead to more impactful proposals, especially if combined with cost-effectiveness/cost-benefit analyses in comparison with the status quo.
Within this topic, it is possible to provide for the transfer and adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to health care. It is open both to proposals requiring: i) improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field; and ii) end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different types of innovation.
Proposals should demonstrate the potential and any future plans for the sustainability of good practices developed or implemented during the action, beyond its life. Such good practices could include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce relevant national policy frameworks, relevant actions to improve the skills of health professionals, patients or carers in the use of the solutions and collaboration with stakeholders for standardisation purposes or in order to leverage additional national funds or private investment for procuring solutions.
Synergies with the Technical Support Instrument[2] and the European Structural and Investment Fund are encouraged.

","21 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 “Unlocking the full potential of new tools, technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Health regulatory bodies and/or Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies adopt optimised data-driven methodologies for the effective use of real-world data (including omics data)[1], and/or synthetic data derived from digital twins and advanced computational methods (such as modelling and simulation or approaches based on machine learning/AI), for the assessment of medicinal products and/or digital health innovations.
Health regulatory authorities and bodies (e.g. medicines agencies, HTA bodies, notified bodies for medical devices) use optimised guidelines for the development and assessment of medicinal products and/or medical devices including digital health innovations.
Health regulatory authorities and bodies across Europe are trained in data-driven decision making using emerging data types.
Scope:
With the emerging use of real-world data (RWD) and synthetic data by the pharmaceutical industry and medical devices industry, regulators and HTA bodies need to perform targeted validation of claims through independent analysis. The principal aim of this topic is to address the data needs of health regulatory bodies and HTA bodies across the EU, as outlined in the recently published “HMA-EMA Joint Big Data Taskforce Phase II report: ‘Evolving Data-Driven Regulation’”[2] and its associated DARWIN (Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network) project[3].
To harness the potential of RWD and synthetic data from digital twins and advanced analytical models, and make them actionable for health regulatory decision-making and for health technology assessment, targeted research is needed on the evidentiary value of these data for a number of relevant use cases. In addition, methods need to be developed to increase the usability of such data by different stakeholder groups. Doing so will contribute to the European Health Data Space and maximise the positive impact of DARWIN in driving up the quality of evidence and decisions on the development and use of medicines and digital health innovations.
Access to and analysis of RWD and synthetic data can inform regulatory decision-making throughout the product lifecycle, namely: 1) support product development (e.g. scientific advice, PRIME[4]),); 2) support authorisation of new medicines and digital health innovations; and 3) monitor the performance of medicines and digital health innovations on the market (effectiveness and safety). Eventually, this will put in place methods and processes that will enable continuous learning from pre-authorisation procedures and authorisation applications on the use of RWD and/or synthetic data.
Proposals should address all of the following areas:
Develop a set of evidentiary standards to be pre-specified and used in the analysis of real-word evidence and/or synthetic data applied to different types of regulatory advice and/or health technology assessment and decisions on the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of medicines and digital health innovations (e.g. in complement to clinical trial data in an authorisation application, or for extension of indications, post marketing surveillance, amendment of product information or regulatory actions on the marketing authorisation due to safety concerns). This includes validating the use of advanced analytical methods for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment.
Address aspects that would enable moving towards a standard data quality framework reproducible across different types of RWD and/or synthetic data sources for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment, with a characterisation of the data collection, management and reporting and an empirical data quality validation. In this regard, it will be important that successful proposals liaise with and closely monitor the work carried out in the context of the European Health Data Space.
Enhance the performance and efficiency of large randomised clinical trials and new models of clinical trials by developing standardised processes and methods to access RWD and/or synthetic data (e.g., facilitating the detection of various types of health outcomes during the treatment period of a double-blinded trial by linkage to appropriate electronic health care record databases, etc.), for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment.
Define methodological standards for the regulatory acceptability of RWD, and/or synthetic data in the context of clinical trials augmented with RWD, and/or synthetic data, for regulatory decision making and/or health technology assessment.
Test the ability of machine learning methods to help identify relevant RWD, and/or synthetic data to match with and to interpret clinical trials, for regulatory decision‑making and/or health technology assessment.
Assess and validate how machine learning methods can be systematically harnessed to screen a large amount of data, including unstructured data, in many electronic databases to identify factors affecting efficacy and safety of treatments and/or digital health innovations, for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment. The cross-border interoperability dimension should be taken into account.
Proposals should involve researchers who are specialised in the use of real-world data and/or synthetic data to evaluate medicinal products and/or health care digital innovation products and services. Proposals should involve national competent authorities (national health care product regulatory bodies and/or medical device notified bodies) and could involve citizens and patients’ representatives where relevant. Proposals should include capacity-building efforts to address inequalities of health regulatory processes across Europe. This should comprise education and training activities and sharing of best practices.
In addition to national competent authorities, proposals could consider the involvement of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for an added value in order to provide an effective interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects and/or to translate the research results into validated test methods and strategies that would be fit for regulatory purpose.
Proposals could also consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) to provide added-value regarding health registry data, interoperability, harmonisation and quality and linking with other data.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:
Researchers and medical professionals understand the chronic inflammation factors triggering the health-to-disease transition and subsequently provide optimal counselling to citizens for improving their health.
Health care professionals have access to and employ objective health indicators of chronic inflammation for monitoring the health status, establishing personalised prevention measures and improving the health outcomes for citizens.
Health care professionals have the scientific evidence and understanding of health-to-disease transition to develop and use improved guidelines for personalised prevention strategies to tackle chronic diseases.
Citizens are better informed to actively manage their own health, have the tools to maintain their healthy status, improve their health and reduce their risk for developing chronic diseases.
Scope:
Personalised approaches for disease prevention seek to determine the predisposition to disease and deliver timely and targeted prevention measures. Understanding the risk factors that trigger the health-to-disease transition is essential for delivering personalized prevention measures or reducing the burden of chronic diseases.
A large body of clinical evidence has accumulated over the past decade demonstrating that chronic inflammation is a process implicated in chronic diseases/disorders. Inflammatory response is a physiological process helping the body to heal against harmful entities, but when dysregulated it could lead to unresolved chronic local or systemic inflammation. The later in combination with the person’s genotype, phenotype, medical history, nutritional and well-being status, life-style and/or occupational/environmental/life stressors is likely to be involved in driving the health-to-disease transition, leading to the onset of chronic diseases.
Proposals should be of multidisciplinary nature involving all relevant stakeholders and may cover several different stages in the continuum of the innovation path (from translational research to validation of the findings in human studies etc.), as relevant.
Proposals are expected to develop and implement data-driven, personalised approaches to identify the drivers of chronic inflammation that may determine the transition from health to pre-symptomatic and early stages of chronic diseases/disorders. The topic does not exclude any diseases/disorders. The human studies and human data utilised/generated should be compatible to an age range as representative as possible to the pre-disease phase and onset of the disease to be studied, in order to boost the fast translation of the research results into proof-of-concept studies.
Proposals should develop personalised diagnosis and/or prevention strategies linked to chronic systemic/local inflammation and assess the effects of different types of interventions and/or their combinations i.e. pharmacological, non-pharmacological, nutritional supplements, diet and life-style modifications, as relevant. Sex and gender differences should be investigated, wherever relevant.
The proposals should address several of the following areas:
Integrate state-of-the-art knowledge and data from suitable human studies (i.e. medical/clinical, well-being, life-style etc.) to identify actionable factors linking chronic systemic and/or local inflammation to the health-to-disease transition. Take stock of omics (i.e. genomics, metabolomics, nutrigenomics, microbiomics etc.), of dynamic measurements of the health and well-being status, and of data-driven analytical tools in order to identify biomarkers and other health indicators linked to the health-to-disease transition.
Understand at the systems-level the human biology and physiology underlying chronic inflammation in connection to the tissues/organ dysregulation, organ cross-talk and homeostasis breakdown triggering the health-to-disease transition, taking into account the person’s genotype, phenotype, medical history, nutritional and well-being status, life-style and/or occupational/environmental/life stressors.
Develop and deploy robust sensors, devices and/or mobile apps and other innovative technologies to monitor dynamically the individual’s health status and to identify objective indicators of chronic inflammation correlative to the health-to-disease transition.
Implement proof-of-concept human studies to assess the beneficial effect of diverse prevention and/or interventions strategies with the aim to demonstrate improved health outcomes.
Test suitable interventions with the aim to demonstrate the reduction and/or reversion of the pre-disease state linked to chronic systemic and/or local inflammation.
Proposals should adopt a patient-centred approach to inform and empower patients, promote a culture of dialogue and openness between health professionals, patients and their families, and unleash the potential for social innovation.
The proposals should adhere to the FAIR[1] data principles and adopt wherever relevant, data standards and data sharing/access good practices developed by existing European health research infrastructures.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

Expected impact:
The expected impact is to increase the visibility of IP licensing intermediary services among the relevant communities (clusters, sector, SME associations etc.).
The initiative is also likely to increase the business proposition of the participating IP licensing intermediaries.
It also aims at improving the business models of the supported start-ups and help develop a sustainable industry.
The initiative will also help the uptake of innovative solutions in technology areas of priority to the EC/EU such as digital, green and health as a result of the activities of the IP licensing intermediaries.
Indicators:
All proposals must monitor as a minimum the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Increase the visibility of such services among the relevant communities (clusters, sector, SME associations etc.).
Increase the turnover of the supported start-ups.
Minimum turnover in the technology areas of priority to the EC/EU.
Refined business models of the support start-ups.
Scope:
Objectives:
The objective of this call is to promote the uptake of IP licensing intermediary services, especially those using modern digital tools. Those services should facilitate the licensing out of technologies or business cases owned by European start-ups and SMEs.
The ultimate goal of the proposed services must be helping EU start-ups and SMEs to enter new foreign markets or to grow or to innovate faster.
Scope:
For the purpose of this call, IP refers to all intangible assets, including copyright, patent, trade mark, design right, plant variety right, geographic indication and semiconductor topographies, as well as trade secrets and know-how.
At least 75% of the proposed matching activities should refer to intangible assets owned by start-ups and SMEs operating in one of the 14 industrial ecosystems identified as priority for the EU policies, such as the Green Deal and the Digital Strategy. The proposed services can focus on only one or more of those ecosystems.
The licensing out of technology is particularly relevant for SMEs that would like to expand to foreign markets. Therefore, the intermediary services must be transnational, covering at least three EU Member States or SMP associated countries. Services for matching start-ups and SMEs established in eligible countries with companies established in third countries are also possible.
To facilitate the access of a large number of start-ups and SMEs to the proposed intermediary services, the use of web-based solutions is preferred.
Applicants must explain how they will cooperate with existing SME support structures (especially in relation to IP and research and innovation) during the implementation of the action. In particular, applicants should map available solutions developed in the context of Horizon 2020, COSME (Enterprise Europe Network and clusters) and the digital hubs, and explain how the proposed intermediary services complement the existing offer.
The main finding of the feasibility study is that there lacks a “demand” for innovative solutions. So the services should aim at developing strategies to identify and stimulate the “demand” for innovative solutions.
Progress reports must be sent to the granting authority explaining how the market develops, what are the challenges and what the approaches that generate more impact are. Non-confidential information about the number and the profile of the start-ups and SMEs using or showing interest in the proposed intermediary services must be included in the progress reports.
Intermediary services in the context of stick licensing processes or Standard Essential Patents are excluded from this call.
Funded activities:
Applicants must propose activities focused on the achievement of the objectives as described above.
The proposed intermediary services may comprise the following (non-exhaustive list):
Developing strategies to identify “demand” for innovative solutions. This may include demand by entities operating for profit but also demand by entities that do not operate for profit, i.e. public institutions, communities, etc.
Interviewing medium and large companies on their challenges to identify their innovation needs and defining matching services accordingly.
Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to squat the innovation landscape (including patent databases), to look for projects that would fit the identified needs.

","LIFE Project Grants
","16 December 2021
","16 March 2022","Objective:
In line with article 11(4) of the LIFE Regulation (EU) 2021/783, technical assistance projects for capacity building aim at
supporting national level public bodies responsible for implementation of LIFE to improve their Member State effective participation in the Programme and increasing the quality of submitted proposals, through specific needs based activities.
Scope:
Only national level public bodies responsible for implementation of LIFE in an eligible Member State in the European Union may apply for capacity-building projects. Project consortium may include additional entities provided that their participation is justified by the project objectives and their role is clearly defined. In principle, the project should be coordinated by public bodies responsible for implementation of LIFE.
The actions included in proposals for capacity-building projects must take place primarily within the territory of the Member State of the main applicant.
Each proposal should be based on a needs analysis. Such analysis should identify:
the reasons for low effective participation to LIFE programme
types of applicants (public organisations, private entities and civil society organisations) that struggle to access LIFE funding in a given Member State (and reasons for that)
types of LIFE projects that are underused in a given Member State (and reasons for that).
Based on this needs assessment the applicants should identify the most effective activities addressing the low participation and/or the ineffective participation rate of different types of applicants (public organisations, private entities and civil society organisations) in the LIFE Programme. Eligible activities are the following:
implementation actions such as training activities, targeted information campaigns
In particular:
targeted and tailored made communication campaigns on the LIFE Programme should be addressed, among others, to public national and local authorities responsible for the implementation of environmental and climate action policies and plans at all levels and across the entire national territory (e.g. municipalities, provinces, environment protection agencies, ecological operational units responsible for the enforcement of national environmental laws, public research institutes, academia)
tailored made workshops on writing solid proposals; actions supporting replication/ transfer of LIFE projects results; helping applicants to build (transnational) consortia; trainings on the use and monitoring of key performance indicators, etc.
Screening of national environmental and climate actions priorities to support, through LIFE projects, the development, implementation, monitoring and enforcement of relevant Union legislations,
Actions aimed at increasing the participation of those types of applicants that struggle to access LIFE funding in a given Member State (e.g. public organisations, private entities, civil society organisations) as identified in the needs assessment,
Actions aimed at increasing the use of certain types of LIFE projects. In particular, in the context of increasing use of SIPs and SNAPs in a given Member State, CAP project may include actions reinforcing the mainstreaming of environmental and climate actions into other sectors, enhancing synergies between LIFE and other EU funds, supporting use of cumulative financing from other Union programmes or private sector,
Procurement of external experts to address ad-hoc gaps in technical and process capability and in particular to provide advice and support in the preparation of a proposal,[1]
Gap analysis and assessment of policy uptake of LIFE project results,
Actions for project management and quality control.
The Commission expects that the budget will be proportionate to the activities that will be implemented under each project to address the low and/or ineffective participation rate of the different types of applicants.
Expected Impact:
An increase of the effective participation and the quality of the proposals by the Member State currently registering low and/or ineffective participation rate.

POLICY CONTEXT
Cancer screening is necessary for disease risk reduction as it allows the detection of the disease at an early stage of invasiveness or even before the cancer becomes invasive. Screening therefore is an important tool in limiting morbidity and improving survival rates of those who have developed cancer.
In the Union, countries have adopted significant measures to deliver cancer screening services to their populations as recommended in the Council Recommendation of 2 December 2003 on cancer screening. Screening methodologies are subject to ongoing development and therefore the application of recommended screening approaches and methodologies should be accompanied by simultaneous assessments of the quality, applicability and cost-effectiveness of new methods.
Quality assurance at all levels of population-based screening programmes can only be ensured if good information about benefits and risks, adequate resources, follow-up with complementary diagnostic procedures and treatment of those with a positive screening test are available.
The report on the implementation of the Council Recommendation on cancer screening (2017) demonstrated barriers to access to screening services by the population and also to deliver quality-assured services. These barriers introduce serious inequities at the Union level and the delivery of quality-assured services in a population-based approach still has to be assessed and addressed through pragmatic public health initiatives in many countries.
This action supports the implementation of a Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan flagship initiative and implements the EU4Health Programme’s general objective of improving and fostering health in the Union (Article 3, point (a)) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (a) and (j) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.
Objective:
OBJECTIVES PURSUED
Activities will include the organisation, implementation and running of accreditation and certification activities making use of guidelines for breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and care.
Scope:
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES TO BE FUNDED UNDER THIS TOPIC
Activities will include the organisation, implementation and running of accreditation and certification activities making use of European guidelines addressing the entire pathway of breast cancer screening, through the use of the work developed by the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC). The mentioned activities will be implemented by the successful applicant/consortium of Breast Cancer Services (BCS), and Conformity Assessment Bodies accredited for the European Quality Assurance schemes.
Expected Impact:
EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT
The expected result is the implementation at national and/or regional level of accreditation and certification quality assurance schemes for the entire pathway of breast cancer screening, including diagnosis and care.
This action will improve the quality and performance of the entire pathway of population-based screening for breast cancer and is expected to pave the way to address cervical and colorectal cancers in subsequent open calls. The action furthermore aims to reduce the disparity among and within the Member States associated with an unequal access to quality-assured screening programmes.
SPECIFIC MANDATORY DELIVERABLES AND/OR MILESTONES
The successful applicant(s) shall take into consideration the developed European Quality Assurance scheme for breast cancer and support the implementation of ECIBC, via accredited certification (ISO/IEC 17065).
During the second half of 2022 (July-September) a pilot accreditation certification run will be implemented in real settings to test the auditing mechanism of the European QA scheme for Breast Cancer Services with the aim to enhance its feasibility across the EU.
The activities of the successful applicant / consortium are expected to be as follows:
Preparatory phase (6 - 9 months) – Set-up the modus operandi of the project and its internal structure, and the rules to ensure the best coordinated approach of the project, including the protocols to run the future activities of accreditation/certification, which will be tested through the pilot run in the second phase of the project (e.g. ‘Proof of concept’ of the pilot). The activities will take advantage of the steering support provided by the Commission’s Knowledge Centre on Cancer. In particular the beneficiary(es) will define the entitiesand the Breast Cancer Services which will participate to the pilot phase, taking into consideration the need to include at least 30% services originating from underrepresented territorial/geographical areas, and/or those Breast Cancer Services which still do not have an accreditation certification process for the entire breast cancer care pathway. In addition, the beneficiary(es)should ensure, where possible, the participation in the pilot run of the Conformity Assessment Bodies.
Pilot Phase (after the first phase until the end of the project) – Organisation, coordination, implementation, monitoring and collection of outcomes, evaluation and proposal for improvement of the scheme piloted, to allow the feasibility and implementability of the accreditation certification in different EU settings, which will foster the subsequent roll-out of the final scheme.
SPECIFIC ACTION-LEVEL INDICATORS FOR REPORTING PURPOSES
Applicants must include data on the following indicators in their regular reporting activities in case of award, and must be prepared to include additional specific indicators where needed:
Number of Breast Cancer Centres, which will be part of the proposal’s consortium.
Number of EU/EEA Member States represented in the proposal’s consortium.
Number of Conformity Assessment Bodies in the proposal’s consortium.
Number of Breast Cancer Centres participating in the pilot.
Number of EU/EEA Member States participating in the pilot.
Number of Conformity Assessment Bodies participating in the pilot.
Number of Meetings done in the first phase.
Satisfaction rate of participants to the project.
Proposals to be awarded under this topic: One single proposal
Expected duration of project: Given the complexity of the activities to be funded under this topic, the recommended maximum duration of a project is 24 months where up to 9 months will be dedicated to the preparatory phase (see section 6 of the call document)."

The main objective of the Erasmus Mundus Design Measures is to encourage the development of new, innovative, high-level integrated transnational study programmes at Master level. These design measures should involve Erasmus Mundus under-represented (a) EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and/or (b) institutions from these countries, and/or (c) thematic areas (see Erasmus Mundus Catalogue).
Erasmus Mundus Design Measures should enhance the capacities of universities to modernise and internationalise their curricula and teaching practices, pool resources, and for higher education systems to develop common mechanisms related to quality assurance, accreditation and recognition of degrees and credits. The support is also intended to explore and exploit the opportunities offered by the European Approach for Quality Assurance of Joint Programmes. Based on the high degree of jointness/integration among the participating institutions, such integrated transnational programmes should contribute to the integration and internationalisation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA)."

JEAN MONNET ACTIONS IN THE FIELD OF HIGHER EDUCATION
The Jean Monnet Action in the field of Higher Education supports Teaching and research in the field of European Union studies worldwide.
By EU studies it is meant the study of Europe in its entirety, with particular emphasis on the EU dimension, from an internal but also from a global perspective.
The scope of EU studies can be varied so long as the EU angle is explored.
EU studies should promote active European citizenship and values and deal with the role of the EU in a globalised world, enhancing awareness of the Union and facilitating future engagement as well as people-to-people dialogue.
The Jean Monnet Action also strive to function as a vector of public diplomacy towards third countries, promoting EU values and enhancing the visibility of what the European Union stands for and what it intends to achieve.
The objectives and criteria to apply for Teaching and research are described below.

TEACHING AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
The Jean Monnet “Teaching and Research” actions will:
promote excellence in teaching and research in the field of European Union studies worldwide;  foster the dialogue between the academic world and society, including local and state level policy-makers, civil servants, civil society actors, representatives of the different levels of education and of the media;  generate knowledge and insights in support of EU policy-making and strengthen the role of the EU within Europe and in a globalised world;  reach out to a wider public and spread knowledge about the EU to the wider society (beyond academia and specialised audiences) bringing the EU closer to the public.
The action also strives to function as a vector for public diplomacy towards partner countries, promoting EU values and enhancing the visibility of what the European Union actually stands for and what it intends to achieve.
MODULES: are short teaching programmes or courses in the field of European Union studies at offered at a higher education institution. Each Module has a minimum duration of 40 teaching hours per academic year for a duration of three years. Modules may concentrate on one particular discipline in European studies or be multidisciplinary in approach and therefore call upon the academic input of several professors and experts. They can also take the form of short specialised or summer programmes."

OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting regional partnerships, enabling young people across Europe to set up joint projects, organise exchanges and promote trainings (e.g. for youth leaders) through both physical and online activities. The action will be implemented through two lots supporting transnational partnerships for youth organisations either at grassroots level or in large-scale partnerships, aiming to reinforce the European dimension of their activities, including on how to live better together after the pandemic and helping to design sustainable future ways of living, in line with the European Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus initiative.
Important thematic priorities for both sub-actions are working with and promoting the EU Youth Goals and, in general, the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027246. The European Youth Goals are also reflected in the President von der Leyen Commission’s political guideline. Project proposals may also treat the themes of the ‘Conference for the Future of Europe’.
Young people and youth organisations are key actors in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth networks should consider ways of forging solidarity and inclusiveness, and how to improve quality of life after the pandemic, which concur with challenges related to digital skills and sustainable green lifestyles.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
The action seeks to specifically support:
the promotion and development of more transnational structured cooperation, online and offline, between different youth organisations to build or strengthen partnerships focusing on solidarity and inclusive democratic participation of all against a backdrop of the backlashes on socio-economic structures and in line with the EU Youth Strategy, the EU Youth Goals and the Youth Dialogue;
The implementation of EU Frameworks and initiatives such as country specific recommendations from the European Semester as far as they relate to the youth area;
Initiatives to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and in society by organising trainings, showcasing commonalities among young Europeans and encouraging discussion and debate on their connection to the EU, its values and democratic foundations, including by providing a meaningful voice to youth in the framework of the Covid-19 recovery process;
the promotion of participation of under-represented groups of young people in politics, youth organisations and other civil society organisations by engaging vulnerable and socio-economic disadvantaged youth;
New ways to empower youth organisations in dealing with the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, by supporting innovative ways of cooperation and network creation, development and management. Indicatively, this could include enhancing collaboration between youth organisations in a digital context through non-formal learning methods and organisational models such as alternative modes of exchanges and mutual aid.
The reinforcement of the European dimension of the activities of youth organisations, including activities on how to live better together after the pandemic and helping to design sustainable future ways of living transnationally."

","09 February 2022","Objective:
The objective of this call for proposals is to facilitate the implementation of Maritime Spatial Planning in the EU, including through the effective application of Directive 2014/89 establishing a framework for MSP.
This call is intended to fund projects to develop innovative responses to tackle specific challenges that EU Members States might encounter when putting into effect, monitoring and/or revising their maritime spatial plans.
Many of these challenges are common to coastal Member States. There is thus a shared interest in developing innovative responses that can apply within a sea basin and/or across sea basins. This means that projects should bring together participants from different Member States, located in a sea basin, or from different sea basins.
To meet these challenges Member States will have to:
Reflect and align their maritime spatial plans to the ambition of the European Green Deal and the related initiatives in areas such as climate change mitigation and/or adaptation, biodiversity, food, mobility, energy transition, alongside established activities and interests.
Cater for cumulative impacts of ocean stressors: promote the use of an ecosystem-based approach, including Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), and strengthen the process of the Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs), which are an integral part of MSP.
Reinforce the sea basin dimension of MSP: meeting the above mentioned challenges, and integrating the new EU initiatives, will require greater cooperation in planning activities in the different sea basins. A good example of this is the North Sea, where coastal Member States have set up structures to strengthen the coordination when deploying offshore wind energy (North Seas Energy Cooperation, with a dedicated support group on MSP - DG MARE is co-chairing this group).
Making MSP digital and pan-European: the European MSP Platform will work with EMODNET to harmonise data and to disseminate the contents of these plans through a common or shared digital platform. EMODNET, in combination with the MSP Assistance Mechanism, constitute a platform unique in the world for this endeavour. The Commission's support for Member States will act as a catalyst. It will also encourage Member States to ensure broad stakeholder involvement and efficient monitoring and enforcement schemes.
Scope:
Themes and priorities
Proposals are expected to develop innovative responses to tackle the above mentioned specific challenges that EU Members States might encounter in the implementation and/or revision of their maritime spatial plans.
Hereunder is a list of examples of ""Priorities” related to the aforementioned challenges:
MSP as an enabler of the European Green Deal: development of a clean, circular blue economy, preserving and protecting biodiversity in the marine environment (in particular with spatial measures), facilitating the supply of clean, affordable and secure, energy, enabling the provision of healthy and environmentally-friendly food from the sea. Climate proofing of MSP, including incorporating adaptation and mitigation actions and/or strategies into MSP, making MSP flexible and adaptive to respond to climate change.
Facilitate/enable the development of an economic sector (e.g. tourism and maritime/underwater cultural heritage, offshore wind energy, aquaculture) in the maritime domain: ex-ante assessments (Strategic Environmental Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment); multi-use in project design and licensing/permits; development of a regulatory framework for multi-use, including Land Sea Interactions (LSI); allocation of sufficient sea space, resolution of conflicts with other uses, enabling synergies with other sectors / activities.
Applying the Ecosystems Based Approach (EBA) in MSP: designing maritime spatial plans to integrate objectives and measures of other EU instruments (e.g. the Marine Strategy Framework Directive) with the aim to reduce collective pressures and ensuring that marine ecosystems are in a healthy, productive and resilient condition.
Developing strategies and approaches to review/revise maritime spatial plans to make them future proof (see Priority 1), more integrated and more coherent, especially in a sea basin context.
Addressing gaps and challenges in the collection, integration, use, re-use, access, including to data produced by non-public actors, of data in the MSP context: using best available data and instruments to prepare, monitor and revise maritime spatial plans. Developing data tools, models and infrastructures, allowing for interoperability and enabling Member States to share MSP data and information, especially in a cross-border and sea basin context.
Promoting ocean governance through MSP: incorporating oceans' governance tools into the MSP process and in maritime spatial plans. For example by enabling stakeholder participation in governance schemes and instruments (e.g. management of marine resources, protection of the environment or of the underwater cultural heritage), by providing capacity building and facilitating joint and/or coherent planning in a sea basin context, or by promoting cooperation with third countries in issues of common interest in a sea basin or a shared ocean space.
Applicants should identify one among the above ""Priorities"" and build their proposal around it.
Priority will be given to proposals that build on the outcome of prior MSP related projects, relevant to the objectives of the call. In this context, proposals should describe how they build on, complement and differ from finalised or ongoing research and innovation projects, including from EU programmes, where relevant.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal, the successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of coastal areas, thanks to deployment of digital, nature-based, social and community-led innovations, to deliver nature-based and scientifically validated solutions to existing coastal socio-economic and environmental threats. People are empowered to act for change through upgraded skills and innovative governance that favours an integrated and interlinked territorial development. Coastal communities are better prepared to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, adapt to climate change, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience to various types of shocks, good health and positive long-term prospects, including jobs, for all including women, young people and vulnerable groups. Tourism, recreational and leisure activity development in coastal areas respects long-term environmental carrying capacity, and social goals.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Nature-based and community-led socio-economic development in the coastal sector, revitalising social capacities in fragile communities and supporting environmental improvements, based on integrated marine ecosystem service valuation, management, conservation and restoration.
Lasting cooperation between local communities and coastal sectors and authorities through enhanced governance and social innovation in different regional contexts.
Properly assessed and transdisciplinary scientifically validated, supported and monitored social innovation experiments related to coastal climate adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity, water quality, pollution, seafood production, ecotourism etc.
Innovative socio-economic models resulting from the projects, based on a long-term perspective using a participatory process of visioning and experimentation, are implemented in integrated coastal zone management.
Improved employment prospects through job creation, development and training of knowledgeable regional/local ambassadors for natural habitat restoration and transformation.
Scientifically validated recommendations for tourism development in coastal areas reflecting long-term carrying capacity and social goals.
Nature-based scientifically validated solutions to existing socio-economic and environmental threats, are embedded in new regulations and European Directives like the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the NATURA 2000 Directives.
Scope:
Coastal ecosystems play an important role in nutrient recycling/regulation, sediment stabilisation and transfer, food production, reducing risks and impacts of climate change, etc. They are the basis of important socio-economic activities such as tourism and wellbeing, fisheries and aquaculture, housing and transport, trade, renewable energy. Integrated coastal zone management requires more and better integration of ecosystem services’ valuation, management, conservation and restoration in socio-economic models through partnerships and collaborations between a range of multi-sector organisations, authorities and coastal communities for a balanced sustainable development and management of potentially vibrant coastal areas.
The multi- and trans-disciplinary proposals should design, scientifically guide and develop nature-based coastal socio-economic models, businesses and marine spatial planning, based on the limits and potential of coastal ecosystem services. These scientific activities should aim to avoid traditional conflicts between human-based activities, reduce urban pressures, protect and restore coastal ecosystems, and support critical ecosystem services in order to ensure good environmental or ecological status, social cohesion and resilience. The proposals should stimulate and benefit from increased nature connectedness of coastal communities; cultural heritage including traditional skills, nature-based social and frugal innovation, active engagement and employments of knowledgeable regional/local ambassadors for natural habitat restoration and transformation, ocean literacy training towards and within companies, digital transformation and collaborative (e)governance improvements. Activities could usefully include innovative business models integrating land-based and sea-based production or service provision with simultaneous benefit for the local economy, local jobs and the environment.
The proposals should cover a representative set of coastal areas or regions across Europe varying according to size and geographical, environmental, socio-economic, institutional and administrative conditions (regional, inter-regional, macro-region, cross-border). Interactive research approaches should be used to engage with relevant stakeholders, local businesses and citizens and elaborate options for cooperation, networking and integrated governance seeking to enhance partnership. Proposals could seek to create long-lasting relationships within and between the case study areas benchmarked by the project in order to generate knowledge exchange to foster synergistic relationships in different coastal areas of Europe.
The potential use of instruments provided by the European Structural and Investment Funds for the period 2021-2027 should be explored. Some cooperation activities with projects financed under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-04, Destination ‘Biodiversity and ecosystem services’ and Green Deal Call topics could be included; as well as with relevant projects from other EU programmes or with relevant EU initiatives and networks.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
Proposals must involve coastal actors and other land and sea-based businesses, and economic and local development bodies to implement the required multi-actor approach (cf eligibility conditions). Engaging with managing authorities of the European Structural and Investment Funds during the project would help increase implementation of the project outcomes and support further uptake.
This topic should be linked to the Horizon Europe Missions Ocean, seas and waters and Adaptation to Climate Change including Societal Transformation, the Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy, the Biodiversity Partnership or other partnerships where relevant.
Social innovation[1] is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal objectives, the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, the EU bioeconomy strategy and the blue growth strategy, the successful proposal will support research and innovation on animal health and welfare in aquaculture to contribute to an environmentally friendly, inclusive, safe and healthy seafood production, including from freshwaters.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Advancement of knowledge about how farmed fish react to farming conditions and their effects on their welfare and growth.
Development of innovative and less invasive disease prevention, monitoring, control and treatment approaches for a more sustainable production.
Healthier seafood production through improvement in farming practices and thus contribute to increase its competitiveness.
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.
Scope:
Aquaculture is the food production sector with the fastest growth globally, but in the EU it is stagnant. Fish and mollusc disease remain an important constraint on productivity and its prevention and management are essential for the sustainability of the European aquaculture industry. Parasites, viruses and microbes often have devastating effects when they infect fish or shellfish farms. The great variety of species cultured and production systems used hinders the implementation of good husbandry practices tailored to each aquatic species. The aquaculture sector falls short of codes of good practice and technologies for the early detection, prevention and control of aquatic diseases. There is also a need for alternatives to pharmaceutical treatments: antimicrobials and antiparasitic drugs are limited and expensive, environmentally impacting and raise consumers concerns on the safety of seafood. The Strategic Working Group on Fisheries and Aquaculture (SCAR-Fish) and the Collaborative Working Group on Animal Health and Welfare (SCAR-AHW) in the frame of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR), highlighted in a recent study[1] several fish pathology issues that need urgently to be explored by research and addressed by innovation, such as rapid tests for diagnosis and DNA vaccines at the level of hatchery, bloodstock, cage, pond, etc. Research in this topic should consider the priorities of the SCAR-Fish study.
A similar SCAR-Fish and SCAR-AHW study[2] revealed major gaps related to fish welfare, such as a striking lack of welfare indicators, and a strong interest from the industry to improve fish welfare for more and better production. Main gaps presented by this study should be included in the research under this topic.
Codes of good practices are crucial for fish and shellfish sustainable production. Research under this topic should develop innovative aquaculture approaches to achieve the highest possible health standard in production, including breeding, nutrition, alternative disease control methods or increased biosecurity. A holistic approach should be applied, considering the interaction with the environment, the reservoirs, wild and farmed fish interaction or the importance of co-existing pathogens simultaneously infecting the same hosts. Modelling of aquaculture health economics should be covered in the study.
Strong and active involvement of stakeholders and end-users, including industry and NGOs, in a co-creation approach, is key for the success of the projects that will be selected.
International co-operation with partners from non-associated third countries is strongly encouraged as a win-win scenario, while contributing to the European competitiveness and resilience.
Where relevant, proposals may seek synergies and capitalise on the results of projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, its continuation European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams

","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the farm to fork strategy and the Headline ambitions of a Digital Age and Economy that works for people, leaving no one behind, and the biodiversity strategy, the successful proposals will support the development of small- and medium sized farms to benefit from digital technologies and strengthen their capacities to their effective and efficient deployment. Projects will therefore contribute to the development of sustainable, productive and climate-neutral and resilient farming systems providing consumers with affordable, safe, healthy and sustainable food, minimising pressure on ecosystems, improving public health and generating fair economic returns for farmers through the development of smart solutions for the use of digital technologies for small- and medium-sized, farms and farm structures. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Innovative solutions for the use of digital technologies (fostering soft- and hardware) tailored to the needs of small- and medium-sized farms and farm structures, including crop- and livestock production;
Increased uptake of innovative digital technologies by farmers;
Contribution to avoiding an increased digital divide between small and large farms;
Increase in the environmental and economic performance of small- and medium-sized farms in the EU and Associate Countries.
Scope:
Despite the potential of digital technologies to increase the economic and environmental performance of the agricultural sector, there is still need to increase the uptake of precision farming tools, particularly among small- and medium-sized farms. An increase in the digital divide between small and large farms is to be avoided.
While one main reason for this circumstance is – as for many investments in agricultural equipment – investments in digital technologies frequently only become cost-effective, if a critical mass of production volume is given. In addition, small- and medium-sized farms and farms structures have in some areas specific needs and strengths, because of e.g. a small average parcel seize, which should be considered in the development of digital solutions for the sector.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Development and piloting of cost-effective digital solutions for small- and medium-sized farms and farm structures for at least grass land and arable crops under representative consideration of the diverse environmental, climatic and socio-economic conditions across the EU and Associated Countries.
Development of business and/ or governance models facilitating the roll-out of the piloted innovation at larger scale in several countries; if relevant, models may not only consider financing the purchase of the digital solutions but also the establishment of other framing conditions or propose public intervention (e.g. data provision) or public-private partnerships or cooperative (digital) service provision and taking.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving at least scientists, , SMEs, and representatives of the agricultural sector. Proposals are expected to demonstrate how networking activities fostering the exchange of experiences and knowledge transfer are organised. Exchange/ collaborate with Digital Innovation Hubs[1] and the consideration of the potential of social innovation to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the wider application of the developed innovative digital solutions are encouraged. Special attention may also be given to certain crops and / or sub-branches, and/or specific production processes for which currently less dedicated precision farming technologies are available on the market.
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties to provide direct support (e.g. in the form of cascading grants) to researchers, developers, SMEs, start-ups and other multidisciplinary actors in particular for populating, testing and validating use cases and/ or other actions contributing to the objectives of the project. A maximum of € 60 000 per third party might be granted. Conditions for third parties support are set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support will be granted. Maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

","28 October 2021
","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal should support the farm to fork’s strategy objective of a transition to a fair, healthy and resilient European agriculture, notably its objective to promote agroecology, and the target to reduce the overall use and risk of chemical pesticides[1], by unfolding the potential of agroecology to provide alternative weeding strategies that reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides used as herbicides. This will support the transition to sustainable, safe, productive, climate-neutral and resilient farming systems that minimise the pressure on ecosystems while ensuring fair economic returns for farmers.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Evidence of optimal and innovative combinations of holistic alternative weeding techniques based on agroecological approaches in different European pedo-climatic conditions for a wide range of crops and farming systems, including conventional, organic and mixed farming;
Quantitative and qualitative evidence of the social, economic and environmental sustainability and performance, as well as trade-offs, of different alternative weeding strategies across Europe at farm, landscape and regional levels, and in the medium to long term;
Robust evidence of factors influencing farmers’ decision-making and improved knowledge co-creation and feedback among actors in the food value chain, resulting in ease of use, end-user acceptance and increased implementation of alternative and holistic weeding strategies based on an integrated use of agroecological approaches;
Improved, open access to data on current weed management practices and use of herbicides across several representative European agro-ecosystems.
Scope:
Herbicides have become the foundation of weed management in EU farming systems. Given that herbicides can have harmful effects on the environment, non-target organisms, and animal and human health, reducing reliance on these products has become a policy objective. Sustainable and effective non-chemical alternatives to reduce or eliminate the use of herbicides are largely lacking for most crops and farming systems in the EU. Weed-related challenges can be better addressed as a part of broad-based, holistic strategies such as agroecology[2] that, by relying on and maximising the use of ecological processes to support agricultural production, have the potential to advance ecosystem sustainability while ensuring profitability of the farming activity. Agroecology is a holistic approach that relies on and maximises the use of ecological processes to support agricultural production. By working more with nature and ecosystem services, agroecology has the potential to increase the circularity, diversification and autonomy of farms, and drive a full transformation of farming systems, from input substitution and beyond. In parallel, progressing towards digitalisation or the implementation of new digital technologies is one of the main ambitions facing EU agriculture. The development and promotion of alternative weed management techniques and strategies that do not only rely on chemical herbicides are required. Moreover, factors such as soil and climatic conditions, as well as the type of crop and the farming system can largely determine the spatial and temporal development of major weeds and, therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of these strategies. Agroecological or nature-based principles can provide systemic, sustainable, context-specific and socially acceptable alternatives to address these challenges.
Activities should advance knowledge, build capacities and deliver innovative systemic and holistic solutions to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of chemical pesticides used as herbicides, and will address the needs of a wide range of crops (arable and permanent) and farming systems, both conventional and organic. Proposals should cover all EU and Associated Countries biogeographical/pedo-climatic regions. Proposals must implement the ‘multi-actor approach’ and should build on and expand the achievements of relevant past and ongoing EU-funded research projects.
Proposals should include a clear plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic. Projects should ensure collaboration with projects funded under the following topics in this work programme: HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-05: Agroecological approaches for climate change mitigation, resilient agricultural production and enhanced biodiversity and HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-03: Digitalisation as an enabler of agroecological farming systems. Proposals should identify optimal combinations of agroecological solutions for socially, economically and environmentally sustainable alternative weed management strategies that reduce or eliminate the use of herbicides. They should do so by capitalising on the opportunities offered by cropping system design, mechanical weed management techniques, soil management practices, breeding, bio-based herbicides, precision and site-specific weeding and digitalised weed monitoring, including by using technology and knowledge of weed biology. Proposals should test and evaluate the sustainability, performance and profitability of these strategies versus classical chemical weed management approaches in the medium- to long-term and at farm, landscape and regional levels, undertaking qualitative and quantitative estimates of trade-offs, and identifying gaps and needs towards non-chemical weed management. Proposals should undertake comprehensive analysis of the socio-economic aspects involved in the adoption of alternative weeding strategies based on agroecological approaches and of the factors influencing farmers’ decision-making, including consumer and market aspects, like risk perception and acceptance of food produced with new weed management strategies. Proposals should develop and test strategies involving all relevant actors for knowledge co-creation and feedback to demonstrate and accompany farmers in implementing and/or switching to agroecological weed management. Proposals should develop a repository of current weed management practices and use of herbicides in several representative EU and Associated Countries agro-ecosystems.

In line with the farm to fork strategy, for a transition to fair, healthy and resilient EU agriculture and forestry, including an ambitious target of the reduced use of plant protection products, the successful proposal will support research and innovation (R&I) to help agriculture / forestry sectors to remain productive and contribute to sustainable agriculture and forest health.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
improve risk assessment of new so-called low-risk substances and plant protection products with the use of relevant methods;
foster EU regulatory science and risk assessment of new low-risk pesticides for agriculture;
ensure the safety of new low-risk pesticides used in agriculture through robust and transparent risk assessment;
increase the availability of safe and environmentally friendly methods for plant protection and weed control to reduce risks to the environment, non-target organisms and human health.
Scope:
Concerns are mounting over the effects of pesticides on the environment, non-target organisms and human health. Member States and EU policies seek to reduce the reliance on chemical pesticides for crop protection through the design and implementation of approaches that are more integrated and include restrictions on the use of several active substances. To ensure the lowest risk to human health and the environment, the development of so-called low-risk substances[1] is encouraged by several regulatory incentives in the EU. However, the changing nature of low-risk plant protection products requires increased capacities in risk assessment. The plant protection products approval and authorization process has to keep pace with scientific and technological developments aiming to advance assessment methods of new low-risk plant protection products.
New products may seek EU market regulatory approval, thus proposals should need to consider and address relevant EU regulatory requirements as well as relevant guidance documents that are to be followed for the specific hazard characterisation and exposure assessment to achieve an appropriate risk assessment.
Proposals should contribute to:
improve the risk assessment of newly proposed or specifically adapted low-risk pesticides such as new species/strains of microorganisms, ds-RNA-based pesticides, pheromones, plant extracts, and/or microbiome solutions or a new mode of application with the use of relevant methods;
develop and advance the integration of different tools, technologies and methodologies to support the comprehensive and consistent risk assessments of new low-risk pesticides to ensure safety and sustainability;
contribute to understanding the biological effects of these new substances and/or products;
assess the impacts and risks of these new substances and/or products;
assess and improve the level of certainty in risk assessments of new low-risk pesticides;
identify the relevant additional studies required for assessing these new low-risk pesticides in order to establish that they have a hazard profile compatible with their classification as low-risk substances and plant protection products;
contribute to the standardisation and validation of the developed tools, technologies and methods for risk assessments.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, the successful proposal will support R&I in improving traceability and combating food fraud along the food supply chain. It will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shifts, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
A robust knowledge base of the underlying reasons for/drivers of food fraud (e.g. economic and social) and the extent of food fraud.
Innovative strategies and solutions (tools and devices) to prevent fraudulent practices by improving traceability and safeguarding authenticity, and fostering solutions for fraud prevention.
Improved assistance to control bodies and authorities in fraud prevention.
Improved transparency through digital solutions (such as IoT, artificial intelligence, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies) that meet consumer demand for food transparency, with a focus on demonstrating authenticity of food as a way to reduce food fraud and boost consumer confidence in food origin and quality.
Contribution to further development of policies for food authentication and traceability and for fighting food fraud/food crime.
Support official control by providing guidance on detection and mitigation of fraudulent practices.
Scope:
To contribute to the goals of the farm to fork strategy, the EU will scale up its fight against food fraud to create a level playing field for operators and strengthen the powers of control and enforcement authorities. The new EU Official Controls Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/625) includes key provisions in relation to food fraud. Recently, the issue of food fraud has been thrust into the spotlight and is of increasing concern to society and to the food industry. It can have very different impacts on consumers, ranging from direct health threats (e.g. consumption of toxic adulterants and contaminants) to violation of consumer rights (e.g. mislabelling). With the complexity of the global market and the addition of e-commerce, the safety risks of food fraud are likely to increase. Therefore, there is a constant need for sensitive and accurate authentication methods and innovative traceability methods to prevent food fraud and help the industry and official control authorities. Maintaining the integrity of European foods is vital to protect both consumers and the legitimate producers, industry and retail, and foster consumer confidence in the authenticity of all food products.
Successful proposals are expected to address both areas (area A and area B):
Area A:
Take stock and determine the current state-of-the-art, identify gaps, and suggest short-, medium- and long-term strategies for closing gaps in research addressing various aspects of fraud such as societal and economic drivers, fraud opportunities, mitigation and prevention measures.
Quantify the economic dimension of the food fraud problem and understand the behaviour of food criminals perpetrating food fraud.
Carry out translational research on fraud detection methods to provide the required evidence base for harmonisation and standardisation of methods and harmonisation of strategies for regulatory use.
Develop and validate rapid food fraud detection tools and real-time in-situ/on-line analytical methods for testing authenticity and quality.
Develop and implement new food fraud detection models (based on data, by applying artificial intelligence techniques) and tracing methods through the use of new and emerging technologies, such as blockchain and smart labelling tools.
Build common platforms and tools for sharing information among stakeholders.
Area B:
Support the development of an early warning system (EWS) for detection and possible further prevention of fraudulent practices and an efficient use of artificial intelligence, taking into consideration the data protection rules in place.
Evaluate the utility of different food-authenticity-related databases existing in Member States and the EU institutions, and create a central database/data portal for further use of these data by authorised users to improve fraud detection and enforcement actions by the competent authorities.
Develop tools that increase consumers’ confidence in the authenticity and quality of the food supply, in line with the relevant legal frameworks.
Investigate food chain stakeholders’ attitudes towards adulterated food to understand better their motivation to commit fraud and trade-in inferior quality goods.
The required multi-actor approach (see the eligibility conditions) must be implemented by involving a wide diversity of food system actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research. Proposals should bring together major stakeholders and scientific expertise to protect consumers and industry from food fraud.
Projects relevant to this topic should support policymaking and implementation relevant to fighting food fraud.
Proposals should explain how they will contribute to achieving the objectives of the farm to fork strategy and deliver co-benefits to the four Food 2030 priorities.
Proposals should involve a wide diversity of actors and implement an inter- and trans-disciplinary approach. They are encouraged to build on past and ongoing EU-funded research, and are strongly encouraged to cluster with upcoming projects under the HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-01-04 topic: Innovative solutions to prevent adulteration of food bearing quality labels: focus on organic food and geographical indications. They are also strongly encouraged to work with existing research infrastructure and collaborate with relevant initiatives, including specifically the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality, which provides expertise in food science, authenticity and quality of food supplied in the EU. The possible participation of the JRC in the project will ensure that the project deliverables are compatible with and/or improve existing databases and tools used at the European Commission and foster open access to project results via dissemination through the European Commission Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality, particularly to the competent authorities of the EU Member States.
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they will work with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topic, by participating in joint activities and running common communication and dissemination activities. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the farm to fork strategy, and its promotion of global transitions on sustainable food systems, successful proposals will provide a comprehensive and integrated response to current and future challenges benefiting people, nature and economic growth in Europe and in Africa.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
EU – Africa jointly tackle climate change and environmental-related challenges (e.g., biodiversity loss, natural habitats alteration, landscape degradation) and meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular ensuring food and nutrition security and decent livelihoods.
Identification of optimal combinations of agro-ecological practices that increase the climate change mitigation and adaptation of different farming systems in different agro-ecological zones in Africa while ensuring the financial viability of businesses.
Quantification and assessment of socio-economic and environmental performance of agro-ecological strategies contributing to sustainable agriculture practices, supporting small farmers and access to local and international markets.
Increased end-user adoption and implementation of agro-ecological practices by farmers supporting rural communities, ensuring farm resilience and viability at individual and system levels.
Strengthened transdisciplinary research and integrated scientific support for relevant EU policies and priorities (EU strategy for Africa, Green Deal objectives, etc.).
Scope:
The EU’s relationship with Africa is a key priority for the EU. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing urgency of the climate crisis put pressure both on domestic/local food production and on ecosystems that generate higher health risks with the emergence of new pest and diseases for plants, animals and humans.
The implementation of agro-ecological approaches will alleviate the pressure that agri-food production places on natural ecosystems, contributing to resilience of agri-food systems and facilitating nature-based responses to current and future agri-food risks and threats. Agro-ecological transitions of food systems requires strong food governance with interventions at different level (local, territorial, and value chain) and coherent public policies.
Proposals should build on existing and develop new knowledge, data, models (including indicators) to:
Identify and evaluate the most suitable agro-ecological strategies for various farming systems in different agro-ecological zones, in Africa.
Deliver a method to identify the best combination of agro-ecological practices for different farming systems, identifying barriers to and drivers of (socioeconomic and ecological) its wide implementation and the conditions, means and tools to support agro-ecological transitions at individual, territorial and systems levels, and including prospective related to access to local and international markets.
Develop indicators to monitor and measure the qualitative and quantitative impacts of these strategies for different farming systems, the climate neutrality potential and trade-offs, nutrients flows, biodiversity and improvement of in farm socio-economic resilience.
Support farmers, advisory services and actors in value chains in implementing agro-ecological practices by stablishing communities to support capacity building, knowledge exchange, and share best practices across different human communities in relation to agro-ecological practices that contribute to mitigating climate change and other environmental impacts.
Identify approaches and methods to enhance the demand for food products resulting from agro-ecological practices, from local, national, regional and international markets.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector and, as relevant, bio-based industries active in rural areas.

In line with the European Green Deal objectives, the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, the EU bioeconomy strategy and blue growth strategy, the successful proposal will support environmentally friendly, inclusive, safe and healthy seafood production through innovation in the supply chain.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Implementation of the ecosystem approach for sustainable management of marine or freshwater fisheries or in aquaculture development.
Wider and more diverse range of seafood (including from fresh waters) available to European consumers, and greater overall seafood consumption.
Tools to limit the waste and discarding of seafood during production, processing, transport and consumption, including the minimisation of the environmental impacts of fisheries and aquaculture through better gears or practices.
Verification of existing and development of new seafood processing methods that add nutritional and economic value and minimise the environmental impact.
Improved professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.
Scope:
Despite the vast diversity of biota in the European seas, rivers and lakes, consumers prefer only a few species for consumption. This is even more pronounced for aquaculture production where only a very limited number of fish and shellfish species are farmed. Moreover, some of the farmed species are higher predators and, despite improvements in feeds, fishing for feed is still a sad reality. Waste of seafood during production, processing, transport and consumption is massive; valorisation of fish and shellfish biomass is still far from achieving its full potential in the context of a circular economy.
Innovation under this topic should explore and test solutions for more sustainable fishing and/or aquaculture practices and diversify production through low trophic level fisheries and/or aquaculture. This could include animals (herbivorous, filter-feeders), algae (micro- and macro-), bacteria and fungi. Issues of biology, feeding, metabolism, disease, pathology, environmental sustainability, gear technology, processing, and marketing of products may be addressed.
Innovation should additionally focus on improving the environmental impact of fisheries and/or aquaculture, e.g. with more selective and less impacting fishing gear, low carbon fishing approaches, nutritious and safe feeds, recirculating aquaculture systems, integrated multitrophic aquaculture, disease control and sustainable solutions in fish and shellfish rearing. It may also identify captured species of high abundance and high nutritional value and reach out to consumers to promote their consumption.
Innovative processing, including digital and packaging solutions as well as formulation and/or fortification, may also be considered to minimise loss of fish and shellfish biomass, add nutritional and economic value to the chain (including by-products), enhance the shelf life of the products, and reduce food waste.
The projects that will be selected may also address issues of proximity between seafood production and consumption, e.g. by exploring possibilities to turn artisanal fisheries more environmentally friendly and economically viable. Innovative processing possibilities may also be explored.
A strong communication component and a genuine co-creation approach with stakeholders and end users, including from industry, consumers and NGOs, are key for a successful introduction, in the medium-term, of innovative and sustainably produced seafood in the EU and in Horizon Europe associated countries. Training and education activities should be included.
International co-operation with partners from non-associated third countries is strongly encouraged as a win-win scenario, while contributing to the European competitiveness and resilience.
Where relevant, proposals may seek synergies and capitalise on the results of projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, its continuation European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams.
Social innovation should be considered when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as with the EU`s climate objectives for 2030 and 2050, the EU’s “Comprehensive Strategy with Africa” calls for the EU to “partner with Africa to maximise the benefits of the green transition and minimise threats to the environment”. It states that: “The EU and Africa must join efforts to reach the Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger and address the challenges of nutrition and food security by boosting safe and sustainable agri-food systems.” In support of this strategy, the EU and the African Union are implementing a ten-year roadmap (2016-2026) on research and innovation in food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture to which the successful proposal will contribute. This will help to transform food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), environmental sustainability, biodiversity and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses. An estimated 821 million people are currently undernourished, and 151 million children under five years of age are stunted. At the same time, the number of overweight and obese people is increasing rapidly in Europe and Africa, with no signs of slowing.
This research and innovation action (RIA) will build on the international dimension of the farm to fork strategy. It relates to evidence presented by the EAT Lancet report and the 2020 Global Nutrition Report. It contributes to the agenda and follow-up of the 2021 UN World Food Systems Summit.
A successful proposal will develop and test approaches to innovations that improve nutrition through a deeper understanding of the unmet nutritional needs, aspirations, behaviours and preferences of consumers who remain underserved by markets and face limited access to affordable nutritious foods.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Better informed nutrition policies that can be scaled-up by initiatives such as SUN (scaling-up nutrition).
Improved nutrition in African countries reducing all forms of malnutrition through safe, healthy and affordable diets, including dietary shifts, that reduce the pressure of food production on land and water use and reduces the climate footprint of downstream activities from farm to fork.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Mapping and monitoring of dietary patterns at national/regional/rural/urban levels relevant to different socio-economic and cultural groups, including low-income settings, the most vulnerable, rural food environments and for those in conflict or protracted-crisis situations to better understand what people are eating and how they make food choices.
Contribute to standardised metrics and tools to measure the food environment. In many food systems the absence of formal channels to acquire food lead to a dynamic, self-sufficiency and unregulated retail food environment with a large proportion of informal food vendors. This results in enormous variety in metrics in terms of reference points (i.e. food accessibility), media coverage (i.e. food promotion) and level of implementation (i.e. policies).
Improved knowledge and measurement of the factors influencing dietary behaviour in selected African countries, and development of effective means for each food system actor to share food knowledge and improve food behaviour.
Assessment of the value of and potential for scaling-up of sustainable traditional food knowledge based on access to biodiverse agro-ecological situations.
Assessment of innovations to improve nutrition, driven by a deep understanding of the unmet nutritional needs, aspirations, behaviours and preferences of consumers who remain underserved by markets and face limited access to affordable nutritious foods.
Innovative and effective tools to improve education, communication, engagement and training on sustainable healthy nutrition and diets, and more generally on sustainable food systems adapted to different population groups in respect of their age, culture and needs and considering gender.
Provision of a scientific basis for sharing food knowledge and developing dietary advice to support policy makers to empower individuals to adopt healthy and sustainable food behaviour, as a win-win for both their health and the environment.
Supporting the development of new integrated policy-making and implementation efforts such as the scaling-up nutrition initiative within and across countries (at multiple levels). This will support healthier and sustainable dietary behaviours and lifestyles with the provision of innovative, efficient, effective, evidence-based and ready-to-use tools/strategies including cost-benefit assessment of the different options proposed.
Contributing to the mapping and monitoring of mycotoxin effects in unsafe foods and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to better understand the relationship between lifestyle (including mycotoxin levels, diets, nutrition and alcohol), gender, geographical, socioeconomic and environmental factors, biological parameters, and the risk of development of diet related NCDs.
Development of innovative and effective policies/strategies/tools contributing to reduce dietary and health inequalities as precursors of NCDs, in particular in vulnerable population groups.
A space for mentoring and acceleration of innovative business concepts, including social innovation and upscaling for promising approaches using cascading funding opportunities.
When relevant, creating links to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the global Earth observation system of systems (GEOSS).
Include a clear plan on collaboration with other projects selected under this topic, other nutrition related EU projects and similar projects funded under the EU-AU HLPD-FNSSA priority from different funding sources including Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, ERA-Nets, African Union research grants, DeSIRA or PRIMA. They should contribute to the work of the FNSSA-working group (WG) by linking to the LEAP4FNSSA project supporting the FNSSA-WG secretariat. They should participate in joint activities, workshops, and communication and dissemination activities and show potential for upscaling.

Scope:
Proposals should target one or more new or emerging[2] plant pests[3] (regulated, non-regulated, introduced or native) that are causing or likely to cause, significant (socio) economic and/or environmental losses to agriculture and/or forestry in the EU and/or Associated Countries. Within the scope of this topic are pests exhibiting an altered and higher probability of entry and spread in a new area that might be the result of changes in their biology or changes in agriculture or forestry pest management practice or rapid spread in new areas[2]. The choice of target pest(s) should consider the potential threat in terms of development and spread, its potential exacerbation under climate change as well as the potential impact on agricultural production, forestry, trade and the wider environment (including soil and water). Activities should consider both the conventional and the organic sectors.
Proposals should:
Increase knowledge of the biology, pathways of entry, behaviour in the plant-soil system where relevant, and drivers of spread including the influence of climate change and globalization of pest(s);
Improve methods and strategies for prevention, early detection and surveillance;
Develop and uptake rapid and effective tools for the prevention of entry, spread and establishment, early detection, surveillance, treatment and (bio) control of plant pests for a sustainable and integrated pest management;
Identify and introduce resistance traits to support the long term sustainability of agriculture and forestry in the EU and/or Associated Countries;
Assess the social and economic implications for farmers and ecological impacts of the plant pest(s) and the development of approaches on how to best cope with these situations;
Integrate citizen science as a tool to monitor emerging pests.
International cooperation with countries affected or threatened by the same pest(s) is strongly encouraged.

","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the ‘farm to fork’ strategy for a transition to fair, healthy and resilient livestock production systems, including the reduction of anti-microbial usage, a successful proposal will support research and innovation (R&I) to help policy makers and relevant actors (e.g. business operators) in the prevention and control of infectious animal diseases in a changing environment, thus contributing to sustainable agriculture and to public health.
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
improving the capacity for risk-based surveillance thanks to a better understanding of sources and pathways of emergence and spread of animal diseases, including habitat destruction;
increasing the capacity to prevent and control diseases in animals, and their potential impact in human population; and
improving understanding of the impact of climate change on pathogen ecology and animal diseases to predict them and possibly define appropriate countermeasures.
Scope:
The emergence, persistence and spread of diseases is the result of a number of factors linked to the dynamic biological or ecological interplay among and between the infectious agents, the hosts (intermediary or definitive), the community of hosts (intermediary or definitive, including wildlife), vectors in the case of vector-borne diseases, the environment, including other living organisms found in agro-ecosystems, and human activity. Understanding this interplay, at various spatial scales (herd, farm, landscape), in particular the capacity of infectious agents, vectors or hosts to persist in different agro-ecosystems, to circulate between them, or to evolve and potentially become more pathogenic or jump between species is often incomplete for known diseases, and virtually non-existent for new diseases, like the emergence of Coronavirus infections highlighted.
The proposals should address relevant areas of research in terrestrial livestock, and related wildlife as appropriate and should contribute to:
1. understanding the population dynamics of pathogens in and outside hosts, including interactions within and between humans and animals;
2. understanding the drivers of pathogen evolution (e.g. mutations) and their impact on virulence and cross-species transmission;
3. understanding the impact of the host immune response on pathogen adaptation / evolution;
4. understanding the mechanisms of behaviour/persistence of pathogens in animals, animal products, vectors and outside the host (e.g. environment, fomites);
5. inactivation of pathogens in a changing environment;
6. understanding antimicrobial resistance development, where relevant.
The choice of the infectious agent / diseases should take into account their importance for the EU policy and regulatory framework, not least for epizootic diseases such as African swine fever, avian influenza or African horse sickness, or for zoonotic pathogens, or major diseases, including production diseases, responsible for high antimicrobial usage and potential transfer of resistance to human pathogens or microbiota. Where appropriate for the diseases targeted, cooperation with relevant professionals outside the animal health domain (e.g. public health, environment) is recommended, as highlighted by the ‘one health’ approach. The gender aspects should be considered, where relevant, e.g. in pathogen transmission.
Proposals may use priorities identified under the SCAR[1] Collaborative Working Group on Animal Health and Welfare[2], Discontools[3], or STAR-IDAZ International Research Consortium[4]. They should draw on lessons learned from other EU funded projects on selected diseases and clearly underline how they will bring new knowledge and impacts. International research cooperation with non-EU countries where selected diseases are endemic is encouraged to maximise the impact.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The conservation and enhancement of Earth’s natural terrestrial carbon sinks such as soils and plants, forests, farmed lands and wetlands is crucial. The European Green Deal gives research and innovation (R&I) a significant role to play in supporting the design and implementation of policies that will ensure the achievement of the EU’s climate objectives. Project implementation is expected to contribute to mitigation and adaptation to climate change and help achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Expand the knowledge base of climate related practices, resulting in increased application of climate neutral farm approaches, assessing and evaluating different methods with all relevant actors involved in Member States and Associated Countries;
Speed up involvement and adoption by farmers of innovative / smart farming practices that mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and that foster the adaptation of the sector to climate change. In the long term, this will support a more substantial contribution of the farming sector to mitigation of GHG emissions and to carbon storage;
Increased involvement of Member States’ and Associated Countries agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS) in climate-related farming issues, including through linking to the European innovation partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) national / regional / local projects and the advisors, with a view to wider dissemination and interaction within the Member States.
Scope:
A wide adoption of practices contributing to mitigation of climate change and carbon storage by farmers is a priority to ensure that the EU reaches GHG mitigation objectives by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. Farming is also vulnerable to impacts of climate change; hence adaptation is of utmost importance. Mainstreaming the use of climate-smart practices has been recognised as a priority at the global level, including at the G-20. In particular, the engagement of farmers in this effort needs to be increased. Therefore, a strong involvement of Member States’ AKIS is needed, as well as the development of targeted advice to farmers on climate issues.
The aim is to establish a three level network in a phased manner over Cluster 6 work programmes 2021/2022 and 2023/2024. The first level is a network which will engage front-runner farmers introducing on-farm trials and demonstration of innovations, using existing knowledge. The second level is a network to connect all advisors on the subject in the Member States, building on achievements of Horizon 2020 projects and EIP-AGRI operational groups and the development of Member States’ AKIS, to ensure the provision of targeted advice. The third level of the network will engage and strengthen the capacity of experimental research stations on climate issues.
The present topic deals with the advisory level. Learning from experiences on “real” farms led by sustainability-oriented farmers eager to pilot existing or new practice-ready techniques, this level will aim at enhancing up advisors’ competences by sharing widely climate neutral ready-for-practice solutions across the EU. This requires interaction between collaborative innovation ecosystems and will involve the main AKIS actors and AKIS coordination bodies in each Member State.
Proposals should:
Use advisors to spread solutions from practice oriented on-farm testing and demonstration in project work programme HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-04 “Demonstration network on climate-smart farming – linking pilot farms” and help develop new solutions through taking part in practice-oriented innovation projects such as EIP Operational Groups;
Collect and provide tool-kits for GHG balances at farm level, performance monitoring, decision tools, climate services, etc. for possible use by a wide range of farms;
Support the implementation of the EU carbon farming manual as foreseen in the farm to fork strategy and the implementation of the third party certification of carbon removals, as foreseen in the circular economy action plan;
Foster knowledge exchange within Member States and regions and establish links with the EIP-AGRI and AKIS networks and AKIS coordination bodies of Member States and Associated Countries;
Link advisors in an EU climate-smart farming network including advisors in all Member States to stimulate effective cross-fertilisation among Member State advisors. Include a sufficient number of various types of advisor per country, taking into account the size of the Member State and ensuring a broad EU coverage;
Proposals should include a task to collaborate with other projects involved in the network HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-04 “Demonstration network on climate-smart farming – linking pilot farms” and a topic to be published in Cluster 6 work programme 2023/2024);
The project should operate for at least seven years and build on climate-related projects from various funding sources. The project must implement the multi-actor approach and may involve social innovation.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

","28 October 2021
","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In support to the European Green Deal and its biodiversity and climate initiatives, successful proposals will contribute to strengthening the ocean - climate nexus by reinforcing the scientific capacity to further our understanding of the natural ocean carbon sinks and their potential role in mitigating and adapting to climate change, help identify lasting solutions to climate change by paying greater attention to nature-based solutions for healthy and resilient seas and ocean. The ocean is a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors. Successful proposals will also close knowledge gaps in support of decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of ocean and aquatic ecosystems through a better understanding of the drivers of change in the ocean and emerging threats.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Furthered ocean exploration and increased understanding, predictability and reduced uncertainty associated with the oceanic carbon cycle and the role, capacity, spatial and temporal changes and trends over time in the ocean and its ecosystems in absorbing and storing CO2 from the atmosphere.
Improved understanding of the potential of the ocean and its ecosystems for contributing to the next generation of carbon cycling models, such as those used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to set global climate policy.
Significant contribution to closing the knowledge gaps in the ocean carbon cycle and substantial contributions made to key international assessments, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), World Ocean Assessment (WOA) and other major regional and global initiatives.
Scope:
The ocean has a key role in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations and currently take up about 25% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions. The oceanic carbon cycle is composed of processes that exchange carbon between various pools within the ocean, as well as between the atmosphere, Earth interior, and the seafloor. The oceanic carbon cycle is a result of many interacting forces across multiple time and space scales. The oceanic carbon cycle is a central element of the global carbon cycle and contains three main processes (or pumps): the solubility pump, the carbonate pump, and the biological pump. In order to better understand, quantify and predict the ocean’s potential for carbon uptake, actions should further research the oceanic carbon cycle. The deep sea and its water column may be the largest carbon sink on Earth but its large-scale carbon uptake potential and future is still unknown. Ocean carbon sequestration options include the management of natural ocean processes, i.e. actions to maintain the integrity of natural carbon stores and actions that enhance the long-term (century-scale) removal and sequestration of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by marine systems, primarily by biological means. Actions should aim at developing innovative approaches to understand the complex processes underlying the oceanic carbon cycle, its efficiency, climate sensitivity, and emerging feedbacks. Actions should further the understanding of the resilience to climate change and temporal and regional variability of the natural carbon inventory in the ocean. Actions should further the understanding of how the biological pump and the deep ocean carbon sink will respond to the rapid and ongoing anthropogenic changes to our planet—including warming, acidification, and deoxygenation of ocean waters. Actions should advance the scientific understanding of marine pelagic and benthic invertebrate and vertebrate carbon, the carbon services they provide (i.e. trophic cascade carbon, biomixing carbon, carbon mineralisation, bony fish carbonate, whale pump, twilight zone carbon, biomass carbon, deadfall carbon and marine vertebrate mediated carbon), and the intricate biological pathways involved in carbon cycling and the associated implications for climate regulation. Actions should assess and model the marine vertebrate carbon services and should link them to population dynamics, with a view to gathering enough evidence to enable their inclusion in the models of carbon cycling. Actions should assess and model the as yet poorly quantified carbonate-forming invertebrate species in the deep sea, such as reef-building scleractinians, as well as their resilience to cumulative impacts of global changes. Actions should contribute to ocean observations and the Digital twin of the oceans by providing an ocean carbon-modelling environment. Actions should improve the sampling of regions and metrics for marine organisms and should gather evidence and data to estimate and quantify the global CO2 sequestration potential of protecting and restoring populations of invertebrates and vertebrates to previous levels. Actions should explore the efficiency and global magnitude of the biological pump and how this will be affected by climate change. Actions should deliver quantification and predictability of the ocean carbon sink and in so doing, should contribute to resolving the uncertainty in the magnitude and sign of projections of future global ocean primary production. The regional variability in the amplification or reduction of the efficiency of the ocean carbon sink is an important element that actions should take into consideration, as the climate effects on the carbon sink (both on the physical and biological drivers) will have a strong regional correlation. The importance of polar regions in the carbon cycle needs to be kept in mind. Actions should further the regional predictive skill beyond five years.
Actions should further investigate tipping points and irreversibility in the ocean carbon cycle (both for the upper ocean and the intermediary & deep ocean), the biogeochemical feedbacks, the changes that will occur in the 21st century, both globally and regionally, and how the multiple stressors will affect the primary production (monitoring strategies to have access to all the compartments - upper, intermediary and deep ocean). Among the stressors, the effects of trawling, drilling, overfishing, deep-sea mining and dredging on carbon cycling and sediment dynamics should be included and investigated using marine monitoring techniques. Actions should look into the policy implications of the findings of this research.
For this action, the multifaceted nature of the ocean carbon cycle necessitates collaboration across disciplines, taking an ecosystem approach. At a minimum, actions should link science on the changing ocean physics and chemistry, and more generally on climate, with the study of the marine biota and their evolution. International cooperation is strongly encouraged. Actions under this topic should plan on a close collaboration among each other and should build upon and link with Horizon 2020 projects and other European and international ocean observing initiatives, including the Integrated Ocean Carbon Research, IOC-R. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, GEOSS, and EMODnet). Where relevant, creating links to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is expected.

In support of the implementation of the Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Protect, restore and sustainable use of marine biodiversity, ecosystems and related services, including blueprints for the creation of socio-economic benefit and required socio-economic transition processes through innovative solutions for ecosystem-based management;
Enhanced integrity and resilience of the ecosystem and restored European blue natural capital;
A blueprint for the extension of marine protected areas or their status shifted from “protected” to “strictly protected” and creation of ecological corridors as part of a blue Trans-European Nature Network, and a strategy to build such network;
Connected support for well-managed marine protected areas;
Reinforced EU leadership in international efforts to combat biodiversity loss in line with the EU key priorities and international commitments, including through the protection, conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and biodiversity.
Scope:
Proposals under this topic will focus on innovation actions in protection, conservation and enhancement of the EU's blue natural capital that have the potential to be up scaled and reproduced at European level and beyond. Proposals will develop a strategic approach towards identifying needs, sharing innovation and transferring solutions between initiatives to create well managed marine protected areas. Proposals are expected to focus on marine biodiversity hot spots[1] and enable ecological corridors leading to a truly coherent and resilient blue Trans-European Nature Network[2], and promoting and supporting investments in infrastructure that “builds with nature”. Projects will test and demonstrate novel methods, business models with revenue streams, social innovation to enable flexible socio-ecological management of protected areas to cope with a rapidly changing environment for coastal, offshore and deep-sea marine ecosystems, taking into account their connectivity and the need to preserve their inherent natural dynamics. Management and governance will ensure the sustainability of aquatic ecosystem protection initiatives. The proposals will duly consider national, local and regional protection and restoration initiatives, including relevant activities carried out under Regional Sea Conventions[3], to ensure effective management and governance of such initiatives and facilitate dialogue with all relevant stakeholders and show options to link such initiatives in a mutually supportive network[4].
Based on scientific evidence underpinning the extension of networks of marine protected areas, activities to map EU marine biodiversity, highlighting the high biodiversity value or potential ones, and assessing coherence of the existing networks will be carried out. The action should not be limited to specific areas, but rather be a large-scale activity that supports, inter alia, also the implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs).
Proposals will build upon the existing digital knowledge systems for access to data, monitoring and forecasts and knowledge dissemination. MPA networks developed within regional seas conventions could also be considered for further actions. The proposed innovation actions for the Blue Parks will focus on the best-suited and most effective protection that will enable conservation and restauration, as per the biogeographical area or marine region. Identification of the best suited areas for marine protected areas under strict protection would be welcomed. Any proposal for new protected areas needs to concentrate on areas of very high biodiversity value or potential[5] and be consistent with the Commission Guidance to Members States on the designation of additional protected areas, including a definition of a strict protection.
When identifying additional areas to be protected, particular account needs to be taken of the links between its ecosystems functions and their capacity to offer a wide range of services, in particular to contributing to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and need to be made more resilient. Priority should be given not only to the protection of coastal biogenic habitat based carbon-rich ecosystems, but also of pelagic and benthic ecosystems, which have a more extensive coverage and therefore can provide a significant contribution restore ecosystem processes and functions including to mitigate climate change. Such ecosystems have inherent capacity to store carbon, but may also need to be protected to avoid the release to the atmosphere of the carbon that they currently store[6]. Particular attention should also be given to creating the adequate conditions for the movement of species or habitats and more generally for increasing nature’s capacity to adapt to climate change.
The projects will look at all ecosystem functions and processes using a coherent and systemic approach and avoid the risk of trade-offs of focusing on one or very few ecosystem services at the expense of others.
Projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other projects funded under other topics in the Mission Ocean, seas and waters as well as in other relevant Missions, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Of particular importance in this context is topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-CLIMA-02-04: “Large scale demonstrators of climate resilience creating cross-border value”. For this purpose, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.
A strong cooperation is expected with Cluster 6 topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-12 (Improved science based maritime spatial planning and identification of marine protected areas).
Projects funded under this topic would benefit from networking and exchanges of information with the projects funded under other Cluster 6 topics: HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-10 (Demonstration of measures and management for coastal and marine ecosystems restoration and resilience in simplified socio-ecological systems); HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-03 (Understanding and valuing coastal and marine biodiversity and ecosystems services); HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-04 (Assess and predict integrated impacts of cumulative direct and indirect stressors on coastal and marine biodiversity, ecosystems and their services); HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-02: Understanding the oceanic carbon cycle as well as with activities supported under the H2020 Green Deal call, notably LC-GD-7-1-2020 Restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services.
The involvement of national and local authorities and coastal communities will be required in order to ensure that the solutions designed are best suited, co-created and with the necessary ownership for their successful implementation. Citizen engagement is a pillar concept for the Mission. Activities should, therefore, promote a proactive involvement of local communities, innovative management practices, developing adequate facilitation and mediation skills applied through a proactive approach that targets local populations and land & sea use planning decision‐makers, MPAs managers, and all relevant stakeholders, allowing for co-creation of solutions. Citizen engagement related activities should also be gender-responsive and socially inclusive.
Proposals are expected to contribute to the implementation of the existing legislation, notably in relation to Marine Protected Areas, by addressing environmental or anthropogenic pressures.
Proposals are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission’s objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ‘development and piloting’ phase and 2030 for the ‘deployment and upscaling phase’.

","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
A suite of models, including at least a high-resolution global ocean circulation model and coastal models at the land-sea interface ready for configuration and simulation;
Interoperable standards and APIs so that the twin models can be interfaced with Copernicus models (coupling, forcing, boundary conditions, …) or external models (hybrid twins) and run in conjunction;
Enhanced on-demand ocean forecasting and ocean climate prediction capacities;
Scientific toolboxes to be used in a (co-)working virtual environment;
Improved capability to support EU legislation on the marine environment;
Capacity to support the three priorities of the Mission (biodiversity, zero pollution, zero carbon) and supporting the lighthouses;
A sustainable and integrated set of models and services that contribute to and benefit from developments in the Digital Europe Programme, contributing to Destination Earth;
Significant contribution to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.
The outputs of the project should rely on the state of art of science in ocean modelling and digital tools, existing assets at EU level (e.g. from EuroGOOS, Copernicus, EMODnet, Regional Sea Conventions, etc.) and EU and international data management standards.
Scope:
The objective is to prepare the next generation of EU digital ocean models (Twin Ocean) complementary to the Copernicus marine service. They should be integrated into the architecture of the European Digital Twin Ocean, a public infrastructure (linked action with topic “EU Public Infrastructure for the European Digital Twin”: EU Public Infrastructure for the European Digital Twin Ocean, included under Other actions) to ensure access to required input and validation data (e.g. from EMODnet, EuroGOOS etc.), high performance and distributed cloud computing facilities. It will support the development of the Mission lighthouses and will be aligned with developments of Destination Earth under the Digital Europe programme. Projects may benefit from the experience and knowledge of the Joint Research Centre in the areas of marine ecosystem modelling at European scale that is supporting impact assessments by dedicated scenario simulations linked with policy frameworks.
The project should address all activities and tasks as described below, in cooperation and complementarity with the linked action[1] and other relevant actions:
1. Ocean twin: The project should develop the reference models suite for the European Digital Twin Ocean and should include:
the preparation and development of model and data assimilation schemes, enabling simulation and development of what-if scenarios based on, but not be limited to, a global high-resolution kilometric ocean physics model from the IMMERSE project[2], that complement the Copernicus forecasting capacities and support on-demand simulation services;
a suite of configurable coastal models to reach the local scale, as part of the twin ocean suite or the toolkit (see below) in line with state-of-art science proposed in the UN Decade of Ocean Science.
The project should ensure that these models can be used coupled with biogeochemistry, marine ecosystem models (including higher trophic layers) and other integrated models of the marine environment/human activities, etc., used already by policymakers and their scientific advisors. It should be based on state-of-art science, bringing significant innovation to existing EU programmes modelling capacities in support to policy making and implementation (MSFD, Habitats Directive, Common Fisheries Policy, etc.).
2. Developer’s toolkit: the ocean twin should be complemented with a toolkit to favour its exploitation including by additional models or software following specified quality standards. It should include:
a scientific software library with open and free, easy-to-use software, models, AI algorithms (e.g.: addressing coastal circulation, particle tracking, aquaculture cultivation and emissions, ecosystems, hydrodynamics, etc.) that can be enriched progressively;
a virtual development environment, dedicated to scientific validation where groups of users can assess their results, develop validation and product quality campaigns for their models and explore what-if scenarios;
tools to retrieve data and products in suitable form for producing indicators for EU reporting (e.g.: Application Programming Interfaces for MSFD[3], Habitats, Birds directives reporting).
3. Use: The Ocean twin models suite should enable the development of what-if scenarios and simulations to support the Mission Ocean lighthouses. Therefore, it should be demonstrated and validated end-to-end with beta-testers on one what-if scenario in line with the Mission priorities and representative of the complexity of lighthouses.
For all of the above, the proposal should favour access to public-oriented models and algorithms free of licensing restrictions. The necessary service pre-operations, should be put in place including at least an online scientific helpdesk (cascading to Copernicus Marine Service and EMODnet if needed). The project should set up the required scientific governance and technical coordination to link closely with the project related to the twin architecture (topic “EU Public Infrastructure for the European Digital Twin”, linked action, included under Other actions), Copernicus and EMODnet for the implementation, with the other components of the Destination Earth initiative, with the EC/ES Joint Earth System initiative and with the Mission lighthouses to develop fit-for-purpose solutions in the frame of the Mission as well as with projects funded under the Green Deal call in 2020 topic LC-GD-9-3-2020 Towards a digital twin of the ocean. The Mission Implementation Support Platform will support and facilitate synergies between the lighthouses and the European Digital Twin ocean developments and ensure appropriate communication.

","22 December 2021
","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Activities under this topic will contribute to all of the following outcomes:
improved understanding of main gaps in our knowledge as well as of causes and consequences, drivers and barriers to soil health in line with the mission’s objectives[1];
improved capacities to assess potential trade-offs between the mission objectives;
establishment of dynamic roadmaps to support the development and coordination of a coherent portfolio of R&I and other activities for each mission objectives;
increased capacities to develop, monitor and evaluate the mission’s activities based on a common understanding of needs, identified priorities for action and up-to-date information on new knowledge emerging from mission activities and other programmes.
Scope:
For effective coordination and implementation of the mission’s activities, it is necessary to have a detailed view of already existing knowledge, main knowledge gaps and drivers of soil health along with a common understanding of pathways (R&I and other actions) to act on soil health in line with the mission’s specific objectives.
Such “roadmaps” for action for each of the mission’s specific objectives should integrate the needs from different disciplines and sectors and address various soil types, land uses and climatic zones across Europe. Particular attention should be given to identifying R&I needs for land uses other than agriculture that have received less attention in the past.
Proposed activities will
provide a comprehensive, practice-oriented analysis of drivers of soil health considering different socioeconomic dimensions, including public policies, and cultural diversity;
take stock, integrate and synthesize existing knowledge and knowledge gaps in relation to the eight specific objectives of the mission. This analysis should be constantly updated throughout the project as evidence from new science emerges. It should also allow to display the overall R&I efforts on soils geographically distributed across Member States and Associated Countries, proposing additional actions to overcome an unbalance, where relevant. Activities should result in structured, easily accessible and up-to-date overview of major recent and on-going R&I projects and their results in relation to the eight specific mission objectives. The overview should consider projects funded by the EU (e.g. under the EU R&I Framework Programme and the LIFE programme) as well as at the level of Member States and Associated Countries. Major international initiatives should be taken into account, as appropriate;
develop roadmaps for mission implementation according to each of the mission's objectives. Roadmaps should include interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&I priorities and expected results as well as the technical and socio-economic options to reach each of the mission’s specific objectives, both in the short-term and in the long-term. The roadmaps should provide a timeline for action, including expected outputs and outcomes, and suggest measurable R&I key performance indicators to monitor progress towards each of the specific objectives. The roadmaps should be continuously updated over the lifetime of the project and feed into the various phases of the mission.
provide an operational framework to oversee, monitor and assess the mission’s evolving R&I portfolio against the identified objectives and expected outcomes, within the proposed timeframe.
In carrying out activities, projects should
build on available knowledge and activities of ongoing Horizon 2020 projects related to soil health;
involve a range of actors, e.g. researchers, land managers, policy decision makers, economic actors, civil society, social partners and other stakeholders to identify and prioritize the knowledge gaps and R&I needs;
capitalise on the potential of digital technologies including artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT);
address synergies and trade-offs across the roadmaps (and mission specific objectives) to provide an integrated assessment of pathways towards healthy soils.
Activities should be undertaken in close cooperation with the mission secretariat and the Mission Board and build upon existing national and European resources such as of the Horizon Results Platform, the European Innovation Partnership EIP AGRI, relevant Knowledge Centres of the Joint Research Centre and the emerging EU Soil Observatory.
Project duration should be a minimum of 4 to 5 years to allow as much as possible the constant update of the eight roadmaps with input stemming at least from the mission’s induction and pilot phase (2021 - 2025) and partly from the mission’s expansion and innovation phase (2024 - 2030).

CAPACITY BUILDING IN THE FIELD OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING (VET)
Capacity building projects are international cooperation projects based on multilateral partnerships between organisations active in the field of VET in EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and third countries not associated to the Programme. They aim to support the relevance, accessibility, and responsiveness of VET institutions and systems in third countries not associated to the Programme as a driver of sustainable socio-economic development.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
Specifically, the action will:
Reinforce the links between the third countries not associated to the Programme VET system and its labour market so as to better align VET to (emerging) local labour market opportunities;
Increase the link between VET profiles and local/regional/national strategies and priorities impacted by skills, in particular those supported by other European Union actions, in order to ensure coherence;
Increase the capacities of VET providers especially in the fields of management, governance, inclusion, quality assurance, innovation; and internationalisation;
Support the exposure of staff, managers, policy makers and senior teachers to approaches bringing the labour market and VET closer (dual learning, curriculum development with private sector partners…);
Improve the knowledge, technical, managerial and pedagogical skills of VET teachers and trainers;
Integrate the input from teachers/trainers, VET learners and employers, from private sector in particular, into curriculum, profile design and training reform;
Improve the level of competences, skills and employability potential of VET learners by developing new and innovative VET education programmes, especially those delivering key competences, basic language, and ICT skills;
Foster cooperation across different regions of the world through joint initiatives.
THEMATIC AREAS
Features that characterise capacity building in VET include some thematic areas presented below. Proposals should focus on one or more of the following themes:
Work-based learning (for young people and/or adults);
Quality assurance mechanisms;
VET teachers/trainers professional development;
Key competences, including entrepreneurship;
Skills-matching in forward-looking economic sectors;
Support to the development of green and digital skills for the twin transition.
In addition, the applicant can cover thematic areas that are not presented above. These must demonstrate that they are particularly appropriate to meet the objectives of the call and identified needs.
ACTIVITIES
The activities proposed must be directly linked to the objectives and thematic areas of the action, i.e. they must correspond to one or more of the thematic areas listed above and they must be detailed in a project description covering the entire implementation period.
In the context of this international worldwide action, project activities must focus on building and strengthening the capacities of organisations active in the field of VET principally in the third countries not associated to the Programme covered by the action.
Funded projects will be able to integrate a wide range of cooperation, exchange, communication and other activities including for example:
Creating and developing networks and exchanges of good practice between VET providers in third countries not associated to the Programme and in EU Member State or third country associated to the Programme;
Creating tools, programmes and other materials to build the capacity of institutions from third countries not associated to the Programme (practical training schemes training programmes and tools for assessing and validating learning outcomes in VET, individual action plans for participating institutions; professional guidance and counselling and coaching methods…);
Creating mechanisms to involve the private sector both in the design and delivery of curricula and to provide VET learners with high quality work-based experience;
Developing and transferring pedagogical approaches, teaching and training materials and methods, including work based learning, virtual mobility, open educational resources and better exploitation of the ICT potential;
Developing and implementing international (virtual) exchange activities for staff primarily (including teachers and non-teaching staff such as school leaders, managers, counsellors, advisors, etc.).
In case learner and staff mobility activities are proposed, these should contribute directly to the objectives of the project and be strongly embedded in the project logic as a whole.
The proposed activities should bring an added value and will have a direct impact on the achievement of the project results.
GEOGRAPHICAL TARGETS
The budget available is divided between different regions of the world in 12 budgetary envelopes and the size of each budgetary envelope is different. The funds will have to be used in a geographically balanced way. Further information on the amounts available under each budgetary envelope is below.

Sub-Sahara Africa: Priority will be given to least developed countries; a special emphasis shall also be put on migration priority countries; no country will access more than 8% of funding foreseen for the Region.
Western Balkans: Mobility of learners will be privileged.
REGIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING PRIORITIES
Depending on the countries involved in the project, regional or cross-cutting priorities may be defined. Should this be the case, projects will have to demonstrate how and to which extent they address these priorities.
The detailed list of priorities applying to capacity building projects will be published on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP).
SETTING UP A PROJECT
A capacity building project in the field of VET consists of four stages:
1) Project identification and initiation;
2) Project preparation, design and planning;
3) Project implementation and monitoring of activities;
4) Project review and impact assessment.
Please note that while preparatory activities can start before the proposal is submitted or selected for funding, costs can be incurred and activities be implemented only after the signature of the grant agreement.
Participating organisations and participants involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages and thus enhance their learning experience.
Identification and initiation
Identify a problem, need or opportunity that you can address with your project idea in the context of the call; identify the key activities and the main outcomes that can be expected from the project; map the relevant stakeholders and potential partners; formulate the project’s objective(s); ensure the project’s alignment to the participating organisations’ strategic objectives; undertake some initial planning to get the project off to a good start, and put together the information required to continue to the next phase etc.
Preparation, design and planning
Specify the project scope and appropriate approach; outline clearly the methodology proposed ensuring consistency between project objectives and activities; decide on a schedule for the tasks involved; estimate the necessary resources and develop the detail of the project e.g. needs assessment; define sound objectives and impact indicators (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound); identify project and learning outcomes; development of work programme, activity formats, expected impact, estimated overall budget; preparing a project implementation plan and a sound and realistic communication plan including strategic aspects of project governance, monitoring, quality control, reporting and dissemination of results; defining practical arrangements and confirmation of the target group(s) for the envisaged activities; setting up agreements with partners and writing the proposal etc.
Implementation and monitoring of activities
Carrying out the project implementation according to plans fulfilling requirements for reporting and communication; monitoring ongoing activities and assessing project performance against project plans; identifying and taking corrective action to address deviations from plans and to address issues and risks; identifying non-conformities with the set quality standards and taking corrective actions etc.
Review and impact assessment
Assessing project performance against project objectives and implementation plans; evaluation of the activities and their impact at different levels, sharing and use of the project's results, etc.
Furthermore, where appropriate, and in proportional terms, projects are expected to:
Integrate a long-term action plan for the progressive roll-out of project deliverables after the project has finished (based on sustained partnerships) including measures for scalability and financial sustainability;
Ensure an appropriate visibility and wide dissemination of the project’s outcomes, at transnational, national and/or regional levels with relevant partners.
Horizontal aspects to be considered when designing your project
In addition to complying with the formal criteria and setting up sustainable cooperation arrangement with all project partners, the following elements can contribute to increasing the impact and qualitative implementation of capacity building projects throughout the different project phases.
Applicants are encouraged to take these opportunities and dimensions into account when designing their project.
Inclusion and diversity
The Programme supports projects that promote social inclusion and aim at improving the outreach to people with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and people with a migrant background, as well as people living in rural and remote areas, people facing socio-economic difficulties or any other potential source of discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The projects will help addressing the barriers faced by these groups in accessing the opportunities offered by the Programme, as well as contributing to creating inclusive environments that foster equity and equality, and that are responsive to the needs of the wider community.
Environmental sustainability
The Programme supports awareness-raising about environmental and climate-change challenges. The projects are encouraged to develop competences in various sustainability-relevant sectors, green sectorial skills strategies and methodologies, as well as future-oriented curricula that better meet the needs of individuals. The Programme also supports the testing of innovative practices to prepare learners and VET providers to become true agents of change (e.g. save resources, reduce energy use and waste, compensate carbon footprint emissions, opt for sustainable food and mobility choices, etc.).
Digital dimension
The Programme supports digital transformation plans of primary, secondary, vocational education and training (VET). It fosters the purposeful use of digital technologies. This includes the development of digital pedagogy and expertise in the use of digital tools, including accessible and assistive technologies and the creation and innovative use of digital education content.
Common values, civic engagement and participation
The Programme supports active citizenship and ethics in lifelong learning. The projects should offer opportunities for people’s participation in democratic life, social and civic engagement. The focus will also be on raising awareness on and understanding the European Union context, notably as regards the common EU values, the principles of unity and diversity, as well as their cultural identity, cultural awareness and their social and historical heritage.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The acceptance of an application does not constitute an undertaking to award funding equal of the amount requested by the applicant. The funding requested may be reduced on the basis of the financial rules applicable to the action and the results of the evaluation.
As a general rule, and within the limits of existing national and European legal frameworks, results should be made available as open educational resources (OER) as well as on relevant professional, sectorial or competent authorities’ platforms. The proposal will describe how data, materials, documents and audio-visual and social media activity produced will be made freely available and promoted through open licences, and does not contain disproportionate limitations.
WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?
This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call.
The EU grant per project will vary from a minimum of 100.000 EUR to a maximum of 400.000 EUR
How is the project lump sum determined?
Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following points:
a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into ‘project management’, ‘training’, ‘organisation of events’, ‘mobility preparation and implementation’, ‘communication and dissemination’, ‘quality assurance’, etc.);
b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the lump sum showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);
d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such as dissemination of information, publishing or translation).
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action. Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.
The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.

","22 December 2021
","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic will contribute to the achievement of the mission’s goal through a better understanding of the impact of risk factors[1] and health determinants on the development and progression of cancer (including metastasis). The focus should be on poorly understood[2] cancers and cancer subtypes, including in children and adolescents. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes
Researchers and health professionals will understand which risk factors and determinants spur the development and progression of cancer and how. This forms the basis for the design and optimisation of prevention, screening and early detection interventions for poorly understood cancers and cancer subtypes, including in children and adolescents.
Researchers and innovators from different disciplines and sectors will support the development of the UNCAN.eu[3] platform by producing, integrating and correlating comprehensive data from multiple sources (ensuring accessibility and re-usability of data, models and tools created).
Health Policy Makers use the improved understanding of risk factors and determinants in the design of cancer-related health policies in the EU-27 and Associated countries and beyond, including for prevention, screening and early detection.
Scope:
Despite important progress, overall understanding of cancer remains incomplete, for both common and rare cancers and the growing number of cancer subtypes, including in children and adolescents. This requires a new dimension and level of investment in innovative research, including high-potential, potentially disruptive and high-risk projects. There is a need to better understand which risk factors and determinants affect the development and progression of cancer and how.
Proposals should address all of the following:
Develop a systematic understanding of cellular processes with a focus on the transition from a healthy state to cancer initiation and progression, at the individual or population level.
Demonstrate access to and use of multiple comprehensive databases in and well beyond health research and health domains, such as lifestyle, omics, clinical, indoor and outdoor exposure, environmental, urban areas and sprawl, climate, agricultural crop and land use, geo-positioning, and remote sensing. Proposals should build on longitudinal cohorts, case-control studies, biobanks, registries and many other initiatives[4], and use state-of-the art digital tools for data analyses and modelling, wherever possible.
Analyse and integrate existing knowledge and high-quality data from biomedical and clinical studies, using advanced technologies such as computer modelling, AI and machine learning with the objective to identify factors and determinants triggering the transition from the healthy state to the initiation and progression of poorly understood cancers and cancer subtypes, including in children and adolescents.
The influence of age, including in utero and early-life factors and determinants; environmental factors; genetic and epigenetic risk; socio-economic status; behavioural, including lifestyle risk factors; as well as social, cultural, sex and gender aspects including inequalities, should be taken into account across all aspects mentioned above.
Due consideration should be given to newly EU-funded initiatives such as the Knowledge Centre on Cancer, HealthyCloud, EOSC-Life, the European Health Data Space (EHDS) Joint Action, 1+ Million Genomes / Beyond One Million Genomes (B1MG), the future Innovative Health Initative and EIT Health Knowledge Innovation Community initiatives[5]. Links with topic HORIZON-INFRA-EOSC-2021-01-06 objectives (FAIR and open data sharing in support of cancer research) are encouraged as well as with topic HORIZON-INFRA-SERV-2021-01-01 (Research infrastructures services to support research addressing cancer). Successful applicants will be asked to liaise with these different initiatives where applicable[6], with the Commission acting as a facilitator.
The funded actions should develop synergies with the Partnership for the Assessment of Risk from Chemicals (PARC), the “Human Biomonitoring 4 EU” initiative (HBM4EU)[7] and the European Human Exposome Network[8].
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other ongoing projects under the mission on cancer and other cancer relevant projects, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Of particular importance in this context is topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-COOR-01-01, “Coordination of complementary actions for missions”.
The Commission may facilitate Mission-specific coordination through future actions. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and project duration. In this regard, the Commission will take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant initiatives and stakeholders, if appropriate.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
EOSC and FAIR data
[1]Relevant risk factors include both internal and external ones, such as genetic predisposition, those in the environment, at work, because of pollution (chemicals, noise, air, radiation, etc.), lifestyle, diet, physical inactivity, obesity, nutrition, microbiota, infectious agents, etc. At all stages of cancer, across all age and societal groups.
[2]Includes refractory cancers and cancer subtypes, at any stage of the disease in any age group and part of society, with a 5-year overall survival less than 50% from time of diagnosis.
[3]Under the mission work programme a Europe-wide platform, UNCAN.eu, will be established, utilising existing, relevant research infrastructures. The platform should enable integration of innovative models and technologies with longitudinal patient data, samples and biomarkers for identification and translation to patients.
[4]Many retrospective, prospective cohorts, case-control studies and initiatives -in health and well-beyond health- at local, regional, national, European and international level, exist.

","HORIZON Innovation Actions
","22 December 2021
","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Restoration of at least 25,000 km of free-flowing rivers, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy, the EU Zero Pollution Plan and the Water Framework Directive as well as other EU instruments and policies that concern freshwater ecosystem protection;
Reduction of artificial river flow barriers, improved eco-system connectivity in the Danube river basin (Danube river, its delta and its main tributaries), enhancement of water quality, enhancement of management of riparian zones and optimised sediment flow to the Black Sea;
Enhanced restoration of freshwater ecosystems in the Danube river basin with nature-based solutions, including on the Danube delta and the Black sea;
Increased population of the main fish, mollusc and other freshwater and Danube delta (transitional waters) species, especially emblematic species such as sturgeon;
Improved protection of local communities and ecosystems from extreme events (flood, droughts, storms) in the Danube river basin and its delta, in particular with nature based solutions;
Support the scaling up of ecosystem and biodiversity restoration in the ‘associated regions’ within the Danube river basin and Black Sea;
Increased share of local revenue and business activities from the restored ecosystems in the overall local economic activities.
Scope:
Proposals will show an effective and economically profitable way to freshwater ecosystem restoration and their sustainable use in the Danube river basin (including the transitional waters of Danube river delta), focusing on the reduction of the impact of artificial river flow barriers on wildlife movement, restoration and protection of biodiversity and valuable ecosystems (biodiversity hotspots), protection of inhabited areas against floods, measures to reduce impact of drought on freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity as well as sustainable management of river sediments. Nature-based solutions for freshwater ecosystem restoration and sustainable use will be at the forefront of the proposals. Successful projects will at the same time show the way to profitable and sustainable use of the restored freshwater and Danube delta ecosystems and demonstrate how sustainable local activities can be built on and connected with these restored ecosystems and biodiversity to ensure socio-economic benefits to the local communities whilst adhering to the 'do not harm principle' for all activities including pollution.
Proposals must:
Carry out demonstration activities in 3 different countries of the Danube river basin, involving and including in the consortium partners from these three countries;
Identify areas and locations where the solutions are replicable and draw up an action plan and roadmap to replicate and scale up the ecosystem and biodiversity restoration solutions and actions.
The proposals will focus on demonstration of active and passive restoration of freshwater ecosystems, including in the transitional waters of the Danube river delta at a large scale. The demonstration activities will combine measures to increase ecosystem connectivity and ecological flow of the Danube river and/or its main tributaries and delta, improvement of protection of communities against floods using nature based solutions on the Danube river and/or its main tributaries, mitigation of the impact of droughts on freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity using nature based solutions.
To address the impact-driven approach of the Mission and the nature of Innovation Actions, proposals are expected to work with and engage at least 5 ‘associated regions’ to showcase the feasibility, replicability and scale up of the solutions developed within the projects in other areas. ‘Associated regions’ are understood as areas with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities (e.g. neighbouring regions and/or regions in a different sea basin) and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions to restore freshwater ecosystems. The proposals should ensure that the associated regions are located in Member States/Associated countries other than those that are part of the project consortium. An “associated region” must benefit from the Financial Support to Third Parties provided under this topic only once. The partners will proactively reach out to the associated regions to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with those ‘associated regions’ and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement freshwater ecosystem restoration solutions in their territory that contribute to achieving the Mission objectives. The technical assistance to the ’associated regions’ should include the provision of technical advisory services necessary to the prepare roadmaps, plans and projects to restore freshwater ecosystems in the associated regions addressing possible barriers and showing the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions.
The maximum amount of Financial Support to Third Parties is EUR 100,000 per ’associated region’ for the entire duration of the action. Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness.
The proposals are expected to integrate actions to support the social and economic transitions towards sustainable, inclusive and long term management of the restored ecosystems, including natural, social, economic and cultural elements and business models for generating revenue from the restored ecosystems and involve for that purpose local business communities, in particular SMEs, investors and other business stakeholders.
Training and communication activities towards stakeholders, including regional and local authorities from the ‘associated regions’ should be included in each proposal. Local actors, including where appropriate, the European Volunteer Corps and Mission Citizen Assemblies, should be involved in the demonstration of ecosystem restoration activities and any actions for social and economic transitions towards sustainable inclusive and long term management of the restored ecosystems, like citizen science.
The proposal may include actions to prevent and reduce pollution from different sources (such as chemicals, excess nutrients). The proposals should build on research and innovation developed in the frame of related projects in the current and previous EU framework programmes, such as Horizon2020, including Research Infrastructures and the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for the Black Sea (SRIA), LIFE and national and regional programmes in the Danube river basin as well as the activities of Water4All Partnership and Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership and the Common Maritime Agenda for the Black Sea, in particular in the framework of land-sea interactions.
The projects funded under this topic will:
build links with other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the lighthouse and its area to maximize synergies, as well as with the European Blue Parks, other Mission lighthouses and their activities;
build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform and with the Danube river basin lighthouse support facility and platform, for reporting, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities in the lighthouse area as well as with the Blue Parks technical support platform;
support the Ocean and water knowledge system, in particular by contributing to biodiversity monitoring, modelling and knowledge creation and data.
Proposals are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission’s objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ‘development and piloting’ phase and 2030 for the ‘deployment and upscaling phase’.
Specific Topic Conditions:
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5 to 7 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.

Provide input and evidence-based outcomes for shaping future initiatives, policies and strategies that address societal changes, future needs and expectations of young generations with regard to the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems and enhance ocean literacy among them;
Better understanding of the connection of young generations with the ocean, seas and waters, ultimately leading to new products and services, thus supporting the innovative potential of marine/maritime related sectors;
Provide insights and help sketch social interaction blueprints for novel participatory approaches and networking opportunities, aiming to bring the younger generation closer to the sea and water and create or fortify their emotional link with it;
Contribute to the objectives of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.
Scope:
A forward-looking perspective (foresight study) on cultural and emotional relations of tomorrow’s generations with the sea and freshwater, based on surveys, testimonies, contributions, observations of and evidence-gathering from this specific social group, would contribute towards shaping transformative marine/maritime policies, guiding future initiatives in this field and allowing innovative solutions for aquatic ecosystems, addressing the future expectations of the youth for them, to surface. The study should be gender and geo-sensitive and consider socio-economic differences and inequalities between certain social groups in its analysis.
Proposals under this topic will address both aspects below:
Provide an analysis by exploring a future being shaped by changes in our lifestyles and behaviours, climate and environmental concerns and the emergence of new socio-economic values and needs, to better understand the cultural and emotional relation of the next generations with the marine environment and freshwaters;
identify expectations and develop future perspectives, highlighting their implications for future strategies and policies, socio-economic activities, including education, and future investments; consider different youth variables such as gender, age, ethnicity, education, socio-cultural and geographical aspects, etc.
Proposals should contribute to stimulate thinking and relevant action through the production of an evidence-based study and help reshape and recalibrate initiatives already in the field and future related policies and strategies; interaction with all relevant main marine and freshwater research and innovation stakeholders (public authorities, companies, universities, research facilities, citizens, etc.) and networks or initiatives on the ground, through whose input visions and strategies can emerge and converge, is sought.

","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
increased awareness about the value of investing in soil health and its various co-benefits for land managers, businesses (incl. the financial and insurance sectors), local authorities and civil society;
increased opportunities for investments in soil health across value chains;
novel opportunities for developing and diversifying income for land managers;
enhanced cooperation and new partnerships across different sectors to significantly improve soil health and support the manifold soil functions;
emergence of new value chains and products based on sustainable soil practices allowing consumers to make more informed decisions.
Scope:
Healthy soils are the basis of many ecosystems services that we take for granted such as sufficient and safe food, clean water, clean air and an abundant biodiversity. They also underpin sustainable and resilient value chains (food and non-food) and contribute to our quality of life in urban and rural areas. The importance of soil health and the wider environmental, social and economic risks and consequences of land degradation are increasingly recognised across society (e.g. land managers, businesses incl. the financial and insurance sectors, local authorities and citizens overall).
The business case for investing in soils is diverse. It can include increasing revenues and developing novel income streams such as from Carbon Farming, reducing or avoiding risks and costs, enhancing reputation, open up finance opportunities and others. Investing in sustainable soil management and restoration is a long-term endeavour. Incentives are therefore needed to help sharing risks and costs, provide innovative finance options and/or reward production and consumption that promotes sustainable land use. Payment for ecosystem services such as carbon capture, clean water, clean air or biodiversity are possible mechanisms but many more are being applied and developed in accordance with the various needs (e.g. crowd-sourcing, certification schemes, funds for impact investment or from citizens and philanthropy).
Proposed activities will
highlight the multiple dimensions of business cases for investing in soil health by the private and public sectors;
provide a detailed analysis of existing models in Europe and internationally for creating incentives and for generating revenues from healthy soils. Financial and non-financial incentives shall promote a) sustainable soil management across various land uses and climatic conditions, b) products based on practices promoting soil health, c) consumption and certification practices conductive to soil health, d) the reuse of land and e) sustainable soil management in the context of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation;
showcase “good examples” from Europe and internationally for investments in soil health and other types of incentives as well as for “innovators” that lead the transition towards sustainable soil practices, taking into account along with the context in which the presented measures work;
co-design with stakeholders (e.g. businesses, citizens, local authorities) new models for promoting soil health where existing ones do not sufficiently cover the manifold needs;
provide testing grounds for soil business cases and identify avenues for scaling up action on soil health, thus making sustainable soil management more profitable for farmers, foresters, businesses, municipalities and other actors;
develop a comprehensive toolbox of incentives (existing and newly proposed ones) including recommendations on innovative ways of blending finance streams and policy measures. Tools shall be tailored to the needs of various stakeholders (incl. farmers and farmer organisations, foresters, businesses, non-for profit organisations, municipalities, civil society) and address the delivery of various ecosystem services (e.g. carbon capture, clean water, clean air, biodiversity) and land uses (e.g. agriculture, forestry, urban areas);
provide recommendations for policy measures at EU and national levels to support the development of business models which promote soil health;
establish communities of practice/roundtables for environmentally and socially responsible soil health “investors” (including civil society);
develop material and carry out promotion events or campaigns to raise awareness regarding opportunities for soil investments;
explore the potential of digital technologies to support the development of business cases for soil health.
In carrying out the tasks, consortia should build on existing studies for carbon farming, in particular those carried out under contract by the European Commission, such as the recently published “Technical Guidance Handbook – setting up and implementing result-based carbon farming mechanisms in the EU""[1].
Proposals must apply the multi-actor approach, thus ensure the participation of a range of stakeholders with complementary expertise.

Increased awareness about the Mission and involvement of citizens in its implementation in the Baltic and North sea basins and beyond.
Scope:
The Mission Ocean, seas and water WP part under Horizon Europe, defines “lighthouses” as “hubs and platforms supporting the development and deployment of transformative innovative solutions in all forms – technological, social, business, governance, ensuring fast progress towards the achievement of Mission objectives and important impact on society in the river and sea basins through science and technology”. The Mission lighthouse should adhere to the lighthouse implementation charter, ensuring its political commitment to the implementation of the lighthouse.
Proposals under this topic will bring together complementary public and/or private organisations and networks, and integrate heterogeneous expertise to support the rolling out of a “lighthouse” within Baltic and North sea basins and provide a broad portfolio of services ensuring the development and deployment of innovative solutions addressing the objectives of the Mission Ocean, seas and waters in the lighthouse area.
Building on and bringing together existing governance structures and networks and relevant existing activities, proposals are expected to address all following activities:
Baltic and North sea basins lighthouse governance and networking: liaise with the Mission secretariat[1] to ensure a coherent and timely implementation of the Mission in the lighthouse area; contribute to the implementation of the lighthouse charter, consisting in a political commitment of MSs/ACs, regions and, whenever relevant, of third countries and other stakeholders, for instance through workshops and other gatherings, networking and provide support actions initiated or carried out by the European Commission services to establish the lighthouse implementation charters; set-up and support and effective and participatory governance structure for the Baltic and North Sea basins lighthouse involving key players (public and private entities, including SMEs, civil society organisations as well as citizen representatives/citizen assemblies and local communities) at basin level and ensure cooperation and networking of stakeholders for achieving the three objectives[2] of the Mission Ocean, seas and waters; provide networking opportunities and exchanges of good practices within the Baltic and North sea basins and with other HE Missions and HE Partnerships; liaise and network with other Mission lighthouses to ensure exchanges of good practices and sharing of innovative solutions (cross-fertilisation); liaise with relevant projects implemented by other Missions in the lighthouse area and ensure exchanges of good practices; support the alignment of Regional Smart Specialisation Strategies and Next Generation EU initiatives and projects with the Mission objectives and explore synergies between the Mission and Smart Specialisation strategies and Next Generation EU initiatives and projects;
Communication, monitoring and contribution to overall Mission implementation: design and carry out at basin scale communication actions to promote Mission Ocean, seas and waters and its activities targeting different stakeholders and the general public, both at basin scale and at the regional/local level including in the ‘associated regions’[3]; contribute to monitoring of Mission implementation in the lighthouse area (including a liaison with projects under Mission lighthouse topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-04-01: Lighthouse in the Baltic and the North Sea basins – Low-impact marine aquaculture and multi-purpose use of marine space) and provide relevant information and data to the Mission Implementation Platform (see Other actions, Public procurements, topic Mission Ocean, seas and waters implementation support platform – overall Mission coordination and monitoring; European Blue parks technical assistance; citizen engagement; communication ); carry out quantitative and qualitative analysis and studies in relation to the Mission and other relevant activities implemented at basin level; liaise with the Mission Implementation Platform to ensure coherent and timely implementation of the Mission in the lighthouse area;
Develop and foster Baltic and North sea basins innovation ecosystem: identify R&I needs at basin level; liaise with the ocean and water knowledge system and foster sharing of observation data, information and computing toolboxes; disseminate and raise awareness about suitable innovative solutions to address these needs, (at least 2 dissemination activities per year at a basin level); organise demonstration and testing activities for the innovative solutions (at least 2 activities per year implemented within the basin area); support access to finance and mobilise suitable investors, through e.g.: pitching events, networks of investors, venture capital funds, local Entrepreneurial Discovery processes, etc.; support knowledge and technology transfer, including through training and skill development (at least 2 activities per year at a basin level); support cooperation of lighthouse projects with ‘associated regions[3]’;
Support mission implementation with technical expertise and know-how: develop a coherent catalogue of services providing (on-site or remote) technical expertise and know-how for testing, validating, scaling-up, reproducing, customising and deploying innovative solutions under the lighthouse objective, ensuring interoperability with the Ocean and water knowledge system; develop, make publicly available and curate a catalogue of projects and initiatives funded at EU, national and regional level and to the extent possible, include also privately funded initiatives and projects;
Proposals should include an outreach plan to actively advertise its activities and services to the citizens and local communities and to targeted stakeholders, including to relevant industries and SMEs.
Proposals are expected to build on and integrate all relevant existing governance structures, networks and capacities within the Baltic and North sea basins, such as organisations involved in HELCOM, OSPAR, BONUS, BANOS, EU Macroregional Strategy for the Baltic sea, Arctic and Baltic Ocean Monitoring and Forecasting Centre[5], with a view of ensuring comprehensive and inclusive lighthouse governance.
Due to the transboundary nature of waters, basin-scale coordination and cooperation across regions, is required for solutions to be effectively implemented and to resolve shared problems.
Proposals are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission’s objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ‘development and piloting’ phase and 2030 for the ‘deployment and upscaling phase’.

","HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions
","22 December 2021
","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
increased evidence on the main factors driving land management and land degradation as a basis for actions by policy makers, land managers and other stakeholders;
availability of a toolbox for policy solutions to shape conditions and promote practices that are conducive to better soil health and avoid land degradation;
enhanced capacities for risk assessment and risk management through increased awareness and knowledge on hotspots of land degradation, in particular in Europe.
Scope:
Avoiding soil degradation and fostering soil health is for a large part conditional upon the land management practices implemented by land managers, together with pressures on natural and semi-natural habitats. Those practices are framed by several factors (economic, social and cultural) and by the policies applied (agriculture, spatial planning, environment, economic, land tenure, etc.). It is necessary to understand those factors and the manner to influence them, so that farmers and other land managers in rural and urban areas are supported in implementing practices that are conducive to soil health and related ecosystem services.
Proposed activities will:
study in-depth the role of the following factors in soil health and land degradation: (1) economic factors, e.g. in relation to subsidies and other policy instruments, the polluter pays principle, payments for ecosystem services, costs and benefits of prevention, price of agricultural products, income, land markets, land tenure and prices; (2) social factors, e.g. in relation to civil society, social cohesion, income inequality, population density, farm structures, rural economy, farm demography; (3) cultural aspects, e.g. in relation to values and norms, strength of governance and public institutions, environmental awareness, product preferences, representation of soil and land in Member State rural cultures, education;
identify the most important aspects that drive land management and land degradation with a view to elaborate integrated approaches, policies and (funding) strategies contributing to lifting the constraints impeding soil health recovery and land improvement and enable sustainable land management;
develop and test (interactive) tools to assess risks as well as identify and visualise hotspots of land degradation across Europe;
provide testing grounds for the demonstration of solutions in response to specific types of land degradation[1].
In carrying out the tasks, projects should
take account of the diversity of land uses (agriculture, forests, abandoned land, residential, mining and industry, recreational, etc.) and of geographical diversity in the EU;
work in an interdisciplinary manner and involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines (including economics, sociology, history, geography);
include a task to collaborate with other projects financed under this topic;
take due account of the potential of digital technologies including artificial intelligence;
capitalise on activities and results from on-going, relevant Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects such as projects financed under Horizon 2020 RUR-03-2018 (CONSOLE[2], Contract2.0[3] and EFFECT[4]) and under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-13 “Modelling land use and land management in the context of climate change”.
While having a main focus on Europe, activities should tap into international expertise and encourage international cooperation, as deemed necessary to implement the above listed tasks.

","22 December 2021
","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Prevention is the most cost-effective long-term cancer control strategy. In EU-27 and Associated countries, population-based screening programmes exist for three types of cancer (breast, cervical and colorectal cancer), which are often not risk-based. Screening and early detection should become faster, more precise, accessible and affordable. This requires new, sound methods and technologies, including data analytics tools and computing capacities, as well as a robust communication strategy.
The COVID-19 pandemic with its detrimental impact on cancer screening and early detection has demonstrated the need for new and improved screening and early detection solutions.
Proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed at and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes
Healthy citizens and cancer patients will benefit from faster, earlier, more precise, personalised, accessible and affordable screening and early detection of cancer.
Health care professionals will be able to deliver earlier, faster, more precise screening and early detection of cancer.
Health policy makers will have the evidence to review population-based screening programmes and screening and early detection methodologies in everyday medical practice, and to include new, evidence-based screening and early detection methods, technologies and solutions.
Scope:
Research is needed to develop and validate non-invasive, or minimally invasive cancer screening and detection methodologies for everyday medical practice and population-based screening programmes[1], including enhanced participation of the target population. These programmes should become faster, more precise and personalised, affordable and accessible.
Proposals should address all of the following:
Based on weaknesses, gaps and possibilities for further development of existing screening and early detection methods and technologies (including those used in population-based screening programmes), develop and validate non-invasive (or minimally-invasive) cancer screening and detection methodologies. This includes ‘integrated diagnostics’[2] based on, for example, imaging, tissue, fluid or exhaled breath gas biomarkers, and agile screening methodologies including digital technologies (such as self-sampling, mobile screening units, digital apps or smart wearables, sensors, telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies combined with sophisticated data analytics tools), duly considering digital and health literacy of people.
Proposals should assess the potential uptake of these methods and technologies in national health systems, clearly identify the target population and consider implementation needs (including health workforce skills). Applicants should also consider aspects of effectiveness, affordability and accessibility when proposing solutions, particularly to enhance participation of the target population.
Proposals should consider the use of living labs or other implementation research models that use open knowledge and (social) innovation systems and support end-user engagement.
The influence of age and early-life factors and determinants; genetic risk; socio-economic status; behavioural, including lifestyle risk factors; environmental factors; as well as social, cultural, sex and gender aspects, including inequalities, should be taken into account across all aspects mentioned above. In addition, differences within and between countries and regions should also be reflected.
Expected stage at project start: Technological Readiness Level 4 and above.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Due consideration should also be given to other relevant EU-funded initiatives[3]. Successful applicants will be asked to liaise with these different initiatives where applicable[4], with the Commission acting as a facilitator.
The funded actions should build upon resources made available by the Knowledge Centre on Cancer[5], and complement actions under the future Innovative Health Initiative, EIT Health Knowledge Innovation Community initiatives[6], and the Digital Europe programme (Cancer Imaging Initiative, Genomics)[7].
Furthermore, all projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other ongoing projects under the mission on cancer and other cancer relevant projects, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Of particular importance in this context is topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-COOR-01-01, “Coordination of complementary actions for missions”.
The Commission may facilitate Mission-specific coordination through future actions. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and project duration. In this regard, the Commission will take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant initiatives and stakeholders, if appropriate.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Implementable blueprints for making communities climate-proof and weather-resilient, in particular by adapting to extreme weather events in coastal areas and sea level rise and other climate change impacts;
Technological, logistical, social and economic innovation for the restoration of marine, coastal and river ecosystems;
Blueprints for implementing such innovation through basin-scale cooperation in the Atlantic and Arctic, including through transition arrangements that create socially and economically sustainable propositions for local stakeholders;
Contribute to the implementation of the European Green Deal, the EU Adaptation Strategy[1], the EU Biodiversity Strategy, as well as the Galway Statement, the Belém Statement, the OSPAR Convention[2] in connection with the implementation of EU marine environment, biodiversity and Arctic policies, the Atlantic Action Plan 2.0 with the aim to work for the benefit of all communities of stakeholders around the Atlantic and the Arctic and the Arctic Action Plan enhancing collaborative efforts to address the challenges in the Arctic;
Contribute to better informed citizens and decision makers, for a better governance.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to focus on marine ecosystem restoration at a large scale through:
- reduction of pressures (e.g. from fishing, pollution, extraction, barriers, and other human activities);
- application of ecosystem-based management, nature-based and building with nature restoration measures boosting resilience to climate change (e.g. sea level rise, floods, loss of permafrost in the Arctic) and mitigating its impacts;
- other effective locally adapted restoration measures and appropriate combinations of all the above.
The proposals should focus on demonstration activities for the restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems through nature-based solutions that boost coastal resilience, such as oyster reefs, kelp forests, wetlands and salt marshes. The proposals are also expected to explore different pressures and climate change adaptation needs in a systemic way, such as the soil erosion and its impact on coastal areas resulting in marine ecosystem pressures.
In addition, combination of nature-based restoration measures with sustainable and circular technological solutions, as well as sustainable aquaculture practices may be considered.
Proposals may involve coastal communities particularly vulnerable to the risks of extreme weather events and sea level rise, including islands and the EU Outermost Regions that urgently need restoration measures to adapt to climate change thus ensuring their population safety and climate proof and weather resilient infrastructure.
The proposals are expected to involve local actors and communities in active and passive marine ecosystem restoration and protection and holistic socio-ecological management of restored and valuable ecosystems, including where appropriate European volunteer/solidarity corps and citizens science activities in the restoration activities. Citizen engagement is a pillar concept for the Mission. Communities need to undergo significant changes in order to become climate-proof, and measures need to be co-owned in order to be best accepted. The involvement of local authorities and local communities will be required in order to ensure that the solutions designed are best suited, co-created and with the necessary ownership. Activities should, therefore, promote the involvement of local communities in order to hear from them the impact of intended actions, and to co-create measures that meet the Mission’s aims while taking local communities’ needs and values on board.
Proposals must:
Carry out demonstration activities in 3 different countries of the Atlantic and Arctic basin, involving and including in the consortium partners from these three countries;
Identify areas and locations where the solutions are replicable and draw up an action plan and roadmap to replicate and scale up the ecosystem and biodiversity restoration solutions and actions.
To address the impact-driven approach of the Mission and the nature of Innovation Actions, proposals are expected to work with and engage at least 5 ‘associated regions’ to showcase the feasibility, replicability and scale up of the solutions developed within the projects in other areas. ‘Associated regions’ are understood as areas with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities (e.g. neighbouring regions and/or regions in a different sea basin) and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions to restore marine ecosystems. The proposals should ensure that the associated regions are located in Member States/Associated countries other than those that are part of the project consortium. An “associated region” must benefit from the Financial Support to Third Parties provided under this topic only once. The partners will proactively reach out to the associated regions to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with those ‘associated regions’ and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement freshwater ecosystem restoration solutions in their territory that contribute to achieving the Mission objectives. The technical assistance to the ’associated regions’ should include the provision of technical advisory services necessary to the prepare roadmaps, plans and projects to restore maecosystems in the associated regions addressing possible barriers and showing the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions.
The maximum amount of Financial Support to Third Parties is EUR 100,000 per ’associated region’ for the entire duration of the action. Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness.
The proposals should build on research and innovation developed in the frame of related projects in the current and previous EU framework programmes, such as Horizon 2020 (e.g. the ongoing projects and activities which are part of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance[3]), LIFE and national and regional programmes in the Atlantic/Arctic basins as well as the activities of the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership and the Atlantic Action Plan 2.0. Projects may benefit from the expertise and knowledge of the Joint Research Centre, especially in the areas of large scale monitoring and assessment set-up, technical input on harmonised methodologies and making links with relevant policy frameworks.
The projects funded under this topic will address all following issues:
build links with other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the lighthouse and its area to maximize synergies, as well as with the European Blue Parks, other Mission lighthouses;
build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform and with the Danube river basin lighthouse support facility and platform, for reporting, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities in the lighthouse area as well as with the Blue Parks technical support platform;
support the Ocean and water knowledge system, in particular by contributing to biodiversity monitoring, modelling and knowledge creation and data.
Projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other projects funded under other topics in the Mission Ocean, seas and waters as well as in other relevant Missions, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Of particular importance in this context is topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-CLIMA-02-04: “Large scale demonstrators of climate resilience creating cross-border value”. For this purpose, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.
Similarly, projects funded under this topic would benefit from networking and exchanges of information with the projects funded under Cluster 6 following topics: HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-10 (Demonstration of measures and management for coastal and marine ecosystems restoration and resilience in simplified socio-ecological systems); HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-12 (Improved science based maritime spatial planning and identification of marine protected areas).
Proposals are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission’s objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ‘development and piloting’ phase and 2030 for the ‘deployment and upscaling phase’.

","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Optimal and carbon-neutral use of marine space in these two European marine areas with high concentration of maritime activities;
Increased sustainable and environmentally sound aquaculture production, particularly of algae and other low-trophic level aquatic organisms;
Ensure safety of farmed seafood and increase consumers’ trust;
Data-based systems enabling a market-wide monitoring and data analysis service for aquaculture;
Increase share of renewable energy consumption along the full value chain of aquaculture and minimise its dependence on fossil fuel;
Enhanced knowledge to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact of aquaculture;
Advance professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.
Scope:
Proposals will show the way to profitable and sustainable seafood farming away from the densely populated coasts of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Such farming will not depend on fossil fuels; a focus should be on low trophic level species; increased production will not lead to increased pressure on the ecosystem, therefore will not compromise the achievement of Good Environmental Status. Aquaculture farms will also share space with other offshore economic activities in a synergistic way. Proposals should demonstrate solutions for increasing circularity by the production of low-emission, zero- or low-carbon and toxic-free farming of aquatic organisms in an optimally used marine space. They should test and demonstrate novel aquaculture methods and techniques, spanning from engineering and robotics to breeding, and from spatial planning to a holistic governance of multiple maritime activities. They should include viable concepts for market access and commercial operation, and outreach to consumers and investors, to avoid that innovative solutions stop operating once grant funding stops. Proposals should also explore options for creating eco-friendly and sustainable artificial reefs in or near the wind energy and aquaculture premises, offering suitable habitats and shelter for fish and other biota. Proposals should also work on approaches for efficient and cost-effective monitoring of both the inputs of the aquaculture industry (such as water quality) and its outputs (such as emissions, including the reporting requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). In particular, proposals should focus specifically on developing data-based management systems that offer services, including risk analysis, to individual aquaculture producers for monitoring and minimizing diseases and alien species, managing inputs, optimizing sustainable production and demand management.
Proposals should include case studies in promising sites both in the Baltic Sea and in the North Sea. At least one case study in each proposal should include a commercially viable pilot farm for seaweeds within wind farms. Additionally, at least one case study in each proposal should include a commercially viable pilot farm for molluscs within wind farms. Additional pilots for farms of other marine organisms are not excluded but are not a requirement, including use of Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA). Proposed solutions should be in line with the EU taxonomy regulation and delegated acts.
Proposals must:
Carry out demonstration activities in 3 different countries of the Baltic and North Sea basin, involving and including in the consortium partners from these three countries;
Identify areas and locations where the solutions are replicable and draw up an action plan and roadmap to replicate and scale up the pollution solutions and actions.
To address the impact-driven approach of the Mission and the nature of Innovation Actions, proposals are expected to work with and engage at least 5 ‘associated regions’ to showcase the feasibility, replicability and scale up of the solutions developed within the projects in other areas. ‘Associated regions’ are understood as areas with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities (e.g. neighbouring regions and/or regions in a different sea basin) and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions for low-impact marine aquaculture and multi-purpose use of marine space in the associated regions addressing possible barriers and showing the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions. The proposals should ensure that the associated regions are located in Member States/Associated countries other than those that are part of the project consortium. An “associated region” must benefit from the Financial Support to Third Parties provided under this topic only once. The partners will proactively reach out to the associated regions to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with those ‘associated regions’ and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement solutions for low-impact marine aquaculture and multi-purpose use of marine space in their territory that contribute to achieving the Mission objectives.

The maximum amount of Financial Support to Third Parties is EUR 100,000 per ’associated region’ for the entire duration of the action. Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness.
The proposals should build on research and innovation developed in the frame of related projects in the current and previous EU framework programmes, such as Horizon 2020, LIFE, EMFF and its continuation the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams as well as national and regional programmes in the Baltic and North sea basins and the activities of the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership. The proposals will demonstrate novel methods and social innovation practices resulting in holistic socio-ecological governance and management plans. The proposals need to build in capacity to reach local/regional and national systems of multi-stakeholders and to enhance their interconnections at basin scale. Multi stakeholder engagements will require active participation from academia to research performing organisations, from citizens to civil society, from young innovators to start-ups, SMEs and other businesses. Activities focused on citizen engagement should also be gender-responsive and include groups at risk of social exclusion to promote a wider uptake of the developed solutions, where relevant.
The projects funded under this topic will:
build links with other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the lighthouse and its area to maximize synergies, as well as with the other Mission lighthouses;
build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform and with the Baltic and North sea basin lighthouse support facility and platform, for reporting, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities in the lighthouse area;
support the Ocean and water knowledge system, in particular by contributing to monitoring, modelling and knowledge creation and data.
A strong communication component and an active involvement of stakeholders, including from the aquaculture and energy industry, fishers, consumers and NGOs, in a co-creation approach is essential for the uptake of the produced outputs. Training and education activities should be included. Market analysis and commercialisation strategies (customer identification, distribution, branding etc.) will be a strong asset.
The outcomes should address the European Green Deal[1] objectives, the Farm to Fork Strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system[2], the EU Bioeconomy Strategy[3], the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[4] and the Guidelines for sustainable and competitive EU aquaculture[5], the Marine Strategy Framework Directive[6] and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive[7].
Proposals are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission’s objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ‘development and piloting’ phase and 2030 for the ‘deployment and upscaling phase’.

","22 December 2021
","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Up scaled and continued excellent citizens science initiatives particularly targeting young people in all EU Member States and Associated Countries;
Increased citizen awareness about the challenges faced by the ocean and waters;
Mobilised and empowered citizens to take actions to improve the monitoring of the health of the ocean and waters and to act against pollution;
Promoted digital applications and testing kits enabling citizens to collect data and observations;
Promoted (digital) data collection and participatory research involving citizens for the monitoring and restoration of ocean and waters;
Standardised protocols, standardised testing procedures for citizen reporting, and locally-relevant programmes;
Contribution made to a special data layer for data provided by citizens, including real-time recordings of discharges and levels of pollutants and litter for different sites, to be harmonised and made publicly available through EMODnet and hence the European Digital Twin Ocean, and aligned with the Destination Earth initiative of the Digital Europe programme.
Scope:
Proposals should connect EU citizens and local communities with the ocean, seas and waters, facilitate broad ownership and education and co-design the transitions within the communities that will allow the European Green Deal targets to be reached.
Proposals should also help to create a stronger emotional connection between society and aquatic ecosystems and collective responsibility, as well as elicit interest in taking action. To change hearts as well as minds, proposals should develop communication actions to inspire awe and wonder, and connect with the things people deeply value. Actions should seek to address the emotional connection, rather than simply attempting to ‘plug’ the knowledge gap.
Proposals should empower and activate citizens, in particular young people, to take action, promote the practice of social innovation and ocean and water citizen stewardship, where appropriate and possible involving the voluntary European Solidarity Corps[1]. They should leverage social innovation throughout the co-design, co-development, co-implementation, and co-monitoring of solutions for sustainable use of the ocean and waters. To promote better public understanding and engagement, the project will support education and training activities, and launch regular citizen science campaigns together with the Member States and Associated countries, building on and enhancing the EU’s work to date on ocean literacy. To create stronger public connection and engagement with the ocean and waters, the Mission will draw on the power of arts, media and culture.
Proposals should identify and pilot best practices in citizen science to restore our ocean and waters and how to upscale them across the Member States and Associated Countries. The data collected should support the monitoring requirements under the Water Framework Directive[2] and Marine Strategy Framework Directive[3] and follow their specific monitoring guidelines. Collected data should be made accessible across Member States and Associated Countries.
Activities should include the development of standardised protocols and standardised testing procedures for citizen reporting, as well as locally relevant programmes to demonstrate their application.
The projects should feed data and knowledge to the Digital Twin Ocean and EMODnet[4] and be designed and predispose a data layer fed by citizens’ observations to allow for a transfer of scientific findings to policy making at the EU, national and sub-national level.
Proposals should contribute to an increasing understanding about the following issues:
Effectiveness of citizen science for participatory research and innovation;
Impact of citizen science campaigns on citizens’ behaviour and knowledge and their relation with the ocean and waters;
potential contributions of specific stakeholders, such as fishermen, sailors, recreational divers, etc.
Differences in gendered behaviour around ecologically conscious and sustainable practices should equally be taken into account and addressed, where appropriate.
Proposals should build on activities implemented by the EU sea basin strategies Atlantic Action Plan 2.0, WestMed Initiative and the Common Maritime Agenda for the Black Sea and respective priorities on Ocean literacy, including those promoted by the Blue Schools initiative. They should create links with macro regional strategies and in particular with their pillars dealing with aquatic environments.
Projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other projects funded under other topics in the Mission Ocean, seas and waters as well as in other relevant Missions, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Of particular importance in this context is topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-CLIMA-02-05: “Local engagement of citizens in the co-creation of societal transformational change for climate resilience”.
To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.

","22 December 2021
","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
progress towards a harmonised and cost-effective framework for measuring soil health and for developing a soil health index, based on a widely agreed definition of soil health. In the long term, results may support a harmonised soil monitoring and reporting in Europe, as aimed for by the new EU Soil Strategy;
significantly improved capacities for soil health monitoring and for assessing the effects of management practices and policy measures based on a set of robust set of indicators for soil health (state and change) and of proxies that are applicable to various land uses;
support to policy development and to the creation of incentives for sustainable soil management through increased evidence on the links between soil health, soil functions and ecosystem services.
Scope:
A priority for soil monitoring concerns the development, harmonization, reporting and scaling of robust indicators to establish the status and changes in soil health. In turn, these indicators determine the operational aspects of the monitoring system in terms of sampling framework, sample collection and preservation, laboratory analysis and temporal aspects.
The selected project will help develop and implement a harmonised reporting structure at EU, national and local levels for soil health. More specifically, activities will
test the eight indicators proposed in the mission implementation plan against their suitability to measure in a reliable way the status and changes in soil health, in particular in relation to progress towards the mission’s specific objectives;
identify alternative indicators where the ones proposed in the implementation plan of the Soil Mission do not prove to be appropriate (e.g. sensitivity to change, critical thresholds, response time, feasibility of pan-EU operation)[1]. The indicators recommended (be it the ones indicated in the implementation plan or alternative ones) should be measurable, realistic (e.g. easy to use in particular for farmers and foresters, urban planners), unambiguous and scalable;
develop a methodology to combine proposed indicators into a coherent soil health index;
identify proxies for soil health, which are “easier” to monitor or more reactive to change. These ""next generation indicators"" could be based for example on observable land use and soil management or on data on the uptake of practices rather than direct measurements of soil properties;
demonstrate the link between the proposed soil indicators, soil functions and ecosystems services supported by soils (taking into account the various types of soils and land uses);
harmonize and benchmark the proposed indicators for a range of soil types, land uses and climate zones in the EU and Associated Countries and define the acceptable limits or thresholds;
update indicators as a result of feedback following monitoring campaigns or data inputs;
develop recommendations for an integrated sampling framework including measuring frequency and density to be implemented in the upcoming LUCAS campaign (planned for 2025/2026) and available for policy implementation (e.g. related to EU-wide soil condition assessments, registers for contaminated sites, LULUCF greenhouse as inventories);
support the development of a Soil Health Dashboard under the EU Soil Observatory.
In carrying out activities, due account should be taken of the potential of Earth Observation and digital technologies (including Artificial Intelligence) for soil monitoring (see also eligibility conditions).
Activities should be undertaken in close cooperation with the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, the European Environment Agency and major R&I initiatives such as the European Joint Programme EJP Soil. The JRC’s contribution is particularly relevant in view of further developing LUCAS Soil and the Soil Health Dashboard under the European Soil Observatory.

","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
increased and more structured dialogue on soil health challenges and solutions at regional and local levels with involvement of a large number of stakeholders and citizens with balanced representation of interests leading to the co-creation of public (including policy response) and private solutions, in coherence with existing EU strategies;
substantially increased awareness and understanding of the value of soils and soil health challenges and their drivers (both bio-physical and socio-economic dimensions) across Europe;
increased cooperation between public and private actors, co-implementing solutions aimed at the protection and restoration of soil health;
more effective exchange of experiences between municipalities and regions across Europe, sharing effectively experiences through an established forum or other mechanisms, also in view of making best use of opportunities for sustainable soil managements provided by European Funds (e.g. EFRE[1], EAGF[2], ERDF[3]).
Scope:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities, with the European Commission’s commitment to democracy and equality, and the role that Horizon Europe Missions play in engaging citizens in R&I activities dealing with grand societal challenges, the successful proposals will involve and activate local, and regional (when applicable) authorities to co-design strategies and actions for the protection and restoration of soil health with citizens and stakeholders, including through social innovation. The successful proposals should contribute to the soil mission specific objective 8 soil literacy [4].
The main objective of this topic is to create spaces and practices for regional and local dialogues on soil health and land management, in order to develop a shared understanding of the nature of the challenges and co-create public (including policy response) and private solutions for the protection and restoration of soil health.
Creating effective and societally desirable ways of changing land use to achieve soil health outcomes will necessarily be locally specific, dynamic and allow for co-design, co-implementation and co-assessment with citizens and relevant stakeholders to make solutions more aligned with societal needs, values and expectations and ensure longevity.
Proposals should enable citizen participation both in the local and regional (when applicable) decision-making process and in the implementation of activities related to soil and land management.
The proposed activities will:
support a large number of municipalities and regions throughout Europe, and related networks, including across borders, to identify, mobilise and engage a critical mass of relevant actors, stakeholders (e.g. farmers and farmers’ association, foresters, land managers, urban and spatial planners, civil society organisations, bio-industries, market actors and research institutions), citizens and existing networks of citizens for substantially stepping up the protection and restoration of soil health in all ecosystems (natural, managed, rural and urban);
explore with regional and local authorities opportunities for making better use of EU financial instruments for sustainable soil management, taking into account programming options taken at the level of Member States and regions;
enable and support municipalities and regions to co-design strategies and actions for the protection and restoration of soil health with citizens, in coherence with EU soil policy and regional strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3[5]) and for smart specialisation for sustainability (RIS4[6]), as applicable;
develop and implement effective participatory processes which enable and stimulate an extensive dialogue on soil and land related activities at local and regional (when applicable) levels. For these processes to be effective, participants should be equipped with appropriate tools and information, they should be strongly connected to decision-making bodies and they should be empowered to reflect, deliberate and propose public (including policies) and private solutions for sustainable land management and spatial planning at their local or regional levels;
enhance knowledge sharing among municipalities and regions on best practice processes and outcomes, matching knowledge needs with knowledge produced;
strengthen inclusive and extensive European networks of municipalities and regions (e.g. the European Land and Soil Alliance[7]), in interlink, synergy and complementarity with other relevant networks, pursuing citizen-identified soil related objectives, engaged in peer-to-peer learning and co-implementing the co-created solutions;
substantially increase the capacity of these networks to contribute to meeting the objectives and targets of the Soil Mission;
include a task to collaborate with the other projects funded under this topic to ensure complementarities, synergies and clear communication to stakeholders around the open calls for third party funding.
The successful proposals will ensure that regional and local governments and administrations are closely associated from an early stage in the projects’ lifetime. The involvement of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) and of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR), as well as of other relevant networks representing regional and local governments should be sought. Clear channels for the uptake of participatory outcomes in decision-making processes should be identified at local, regional (when applicable) national and/or EU levels and feedback to citizens should be ensured.
Proposals should seek for a balanced representation of regions across Member States and Associated Countries, covering a wide range of geo-climatic zones, socio-economic conditions and land uses. Vulnerable and marginalised categories of the population, minorities and various age groups, including both youth and the elder generation, in urban, peri-urban and rural areas, should be adequately involved and engaged in the process. Gender balance should be ensured in all activities.
The proposals selected under this topic should dedicate the necessary resources to work closely together to maximise synergies, in particular with regard to the geographic coverage of regions. They should cooperate as well with the mission secretariat and the project funded under HORIZON-MISS-2021-SOIL-02-07. In addition, proposals should take stock of publicly available results obtained by the EJP Soil[8] on the knowledge and use of citizen science across Europe and engage with relevant innovation networks (e.g. Smart specialisation platforms[9], EIP-AGRI[10], Climate-KIC[11], EIT FOOD[12]).
Consortia must apply the multi-actor approach to include expertise in deliberative democracy, civic participation and public engagement. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium in particular to bring in expertise from its Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy[13].
Applicants should be flexible enough to accommodate for some adjustments that may be requested by the Commission before the grant agreement signature to ensure complementarity of activities between the three selected projects.

","22 December 2021
","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project activities are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
advisory services are strengthened in their knowledge and skill base to provide impartial advice on soils and their sustainable management, based on a thorough understanding of soil functions and ecosystems services supported by soils across land uses and climate zones throughout Europe;
new forms of advice are tested and established, making more effective use of digitization and new models for advisor-farmer-data interactions;
land managers (including owners leasing their land) and other practitioners in rural and urban areas (e.g. farmers, foresters, local authorities in charge of managing green spaces and natural areas) have increased opportunities for access to tailored, practice-oriented knowledge and for exchange of experiences on how to manage land and soils in more sustainable ways;
the farming sector is better equipped to contribute to meeting targets from the Farm to Fork Strategy[1] [2] and the new EU Soil Strategy[3], in particular with regard to the management of nutrients;
more interactive and effective agricultural and forestry knowledge and innovation systems are in place;
local/regional authorities are in a position to integrate considerations on soil health (e.g. reuse of soils, reduction of soil sealing, management and increase of green spaces in urban areas) into spatial planning and decision-making.
Scope:
Land managers and land owners (including farmers, foresters, gardeners, local/regional authorities, spatial and urban planners) often do not sufficiently apply or promote practices that maintain and/or restore soil health because of a lack of knowledge and tailored advice on locally adapted practices. Impartial advisors with ample theoretic and practical knowledge on soils, their functions and management are key to address this gap. It is therefore essential that advisors’ knowledge is constantly updated, standardised to some extent and responds to the evolving needs of land managers and policies.
The objective of this topic is to promote the emergence of specialised “soil advisors” and to strengthen the skills of existing advisors and in view of promoting the uptake of innovations for sustainable land management practices by farmers, foresters and other land managers and owners throughout Europe.
The proposed activities will:
identify, map, and connect – also within the framework of Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) - the main actors relevant to the development, acquisition, exchange and application of knowledge to improve soil health related practices. This can include advisory services, farmers, foresters, other land managers and land owners or land managers’ associations as well as relevant civil society organisations, researchers, and public authorities;
screen existing educational resources and tools (i.e. digital tools, networks, educational resources etc.) applicable to the various aspects of land management and the prevention of soil degradation;
develop, test and share best practices on curricula, tools and methods to strengthen the skills and competences of soil advisors taking due account of novel approaches for interactive innovation and of the potential of digital technologies for acquiring, exchanging and disseminating knowledge and know-how;
create testing grounds for new forms of soil advice and (digital) tools, peer-to-peer knowledge exchange and practitioner-driven experimentation, in particular on the management of nutrients, soil organic carbon and biodiversity. This task should be undertaken by making use – where available - of the FaST tool developed in Member States as part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and by assessing its effectiveness and benefits (in economic, agronomic and environmental terms). The future Regulation establishing rules on support for the CAP Strategic Plans includes, within the provision on the farm advisory services, the Farm Sustainability Tool (FaST). FaST has to provide on-farm decision-support for the use of nutrients, based on the available data and knowledge and compliant with the existing environmental legislation. The legal text mentions that the FaST has to be implemented by Member States and that “the Commission may provide support to the MS in the design of the FaST, in order to ensure a level playing field between farmers and across the Union”. The FaST has to be implemented no later than 2024;
develop a comprehensive toolbox of resources in various EU languages for the training of soil advisors and their interactions with land managers and propose strategies (including financial models) to sustain and update training outputs and tools developed and compiled throughout the project.
Proposed activities should take due account of the different situation of advisory services in EU Member States and Associated Countries and ensure wide access (also language-wise) to main resources for soil advisors across Europe. While focusing on agriculture where advisory services already exist, activities shall explore avenues for introducing soil advice into management and decision-making regarding other land uses (e.g. forest and urban land), taking into account different pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions across Europe.
Projects are expected to make use of the opportunities provided by the European Innovation Partnership “Agricultural productivity and sustainability (EIP AGRI), national AKIS and the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO), e.g. with regard to dissemination of project outputs and exchange of experiences. They should build as appropriate on existing education programmes and training modules (e.g. from EIT KICs) that provide a knowledge resource relevant for the protection and restoration of soil health and of soil ecosystem services. Similarly, they should take into account results of relevant Horizon 2020 projects [4].
Proposals must apply the “multi-actor approach”, thus ensure a balanced mix of actors from various sectors and include expertise from behavioural and social sciences.

","22 December 2021
","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Cancer patients and survivors have specific and currently largely unmet needs. These require deeper insights into quality of life aspects, patient preferences and unmet needs so that health and care systems can better address them. This will improve patients’ and survivors’ quality of life and ensure that they can achieve personal and professional goals, including return to work if they wish so, while respecting individual, social and cultural rights and values. New metrics, self-reported evidence from the perspective of those who are affected, and an expanded high-quality data collection and analysis, using appropriate digital tools, are needed to adequately capture quality of life aspects of cancer patients and survivors. This should serve to orient clinical practice as well as health, social care, and employment policies with the goal of delivering innovation and improving the quality of life of cancer patients, survivors and their families to the highest possible levels, and facilitating their return to work and active participation in society.
Proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes
Cancer patients, survivors and caregivers will benefit from enhanced quality of life, more effective and less burdensome treatments with better supportive care and counselling approaches.
Health care professionals, supportive workers, counsellors and industry will be better aware of the (unmet) needs, expectations and preferences of cancer patients, survivors and their relatives and be compelled to address them.
Regulators and institutions will have a set of metrics, which they can include in decision making about risks and benefits of new health interventions.
Health Policy Makers will have a set of metrics at their disposal, which they can include in their health information and performance measurement systems.
Labour market and social protection policy makers will benefit from additional evidence to consider in the design of labour market and social protection policies that are facilitating return to work and active participation in society.
Scope:
The long-term goal of the Mission on Cancer is to support the development of a framework of newly defined, harmonised and systematic surveys, as well as to collect new and update existing quality of life data and registries information, using appropriate digital tools. These surveys should be launched regularly across all countries and be reviewed with researchers, care providers, health insurance companies, industry as well as policy makers so that more timely, supportive and affordable care can be provided and relevant policy measures can be taken.
Proposals should address all of the following:
Conduct analyses of existing quality of life data from studies, surveys and registries together with patients and with a particular focus on patients’ needs, including return to work. These analyses serve to identify problems, fill gaps and validate sets of minimal quality of life measurement tools and approaches for different types of cancer.
Set up collaborative approaches with patients, communities and multidisciplinary research teams (for example in the form of living labs, making use of citizen science, social innovation or other participatory research methods). Within this co-design process, quality of life measurement tools and approaches should be developed to capture key elements of quality of life from the perspective of those affected by cancer, which are not captured (adequately) with established metrics.
These metrics should cover subjective perceptions of the positive and negative aspects of cancer patients’ symptoms, including physical, mental, emotional, social, cognitive functions, disease symptoms and treatment side effects as well as needs for palliative care.
Prepare and conduct a pilot of newly defined, harmonised and systematic quality of life surveys across the EU-27 and Associated countries, reflecting both its diversity (social, cultural, geographic, demographic, health and social protection systems) and unique differences in incidence and mortality of cancer indications. The surveys should gather data using established quality of life metrics and serve to validate the newly developed metrics focussing on cancer, making use of digital tools for data gathering and analysis where relevant.
These surveys should form the basis for a comprehensive comparison of the quality of life of cancer patients and survivors across and within countries, as well as between different groups, and prepare the ground for future regular, more extensive high-quality data collection.
The influence of age and early-life factors and determinants; genetic risk, socio-economic status; environmental factors; behavioural, including lifestyle risk factors; as well as social, cultural, sex and gender aspects including inequalities (e.g. access to care), should be taken into account across all aspects mentioned above.
The most promising quality of life and preference measures and metrics should be validated.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Due consideration should also be given to other relevant EU-funded initiatives[1]. Successful applicants will be asked to liaise with these different initiatives where applicable, with the Commission acting as a facilitator[2].
The funded actions should build upon resources made available by the Knowledge Centre on Cancer[3], and complement actions under the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan[4], and possibly Horizon Europe Partnerships[5].
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other ongoing projects under the mission on cancer and other cancer relevant projects, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Of particular importance in this context is topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-COOR-01-01, “Coordination of complementary actions for missions”.
The Commission may facilitate Mission-specific coordination through future actions. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and project duration.
In this regard, the Commission will take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant initiatives and stakeholders, if appropriate.

Scope:
The Mission Ocean, seas and water WP part under Horizon Europe, defines “lighthouses” as “hubs and platforms supporting the development and deployment of transformative innovative solutions in all forms – technological, social, business, governance, ensuring fast progress towards the achievement of Mission objectives and important impact on society in the river and sea basins through science and technology”. The Mission lighthouse should adhere to the lighthouse implementation charter, ensuring its political commitment to the implementation of the lighthouse.
Proposals under this topic will bring together complementary public and/or private organisations and networks, and integrate heterogeneous expertise to support the rolling out of a “lighthouse” within Atlantic and Arctic seas basins and provide a broad portfolio of services ensuring the development and deployment of innovative solutions addressing the objectives of the Mission Ocean, seas and waters in the lighthouse area.
Building on and bringing together existing governance structures and networks and relevant existing activities, proposals are expected to address all following activities:
Atlantic and Arctic seas basins lighthouse governance and networking: liaise with the Mission secretariat[1] to ensure a coherent and timely implementation of the Mission in the lighthouse area; contribute to the implementation of the lighthouse charter[2], for instance through workshops and other gatherings, networking and provide support actions initiated or carried out by the European Commission services to establish the lighthouse implementation charters; set-up and support and effective and participatory governance structure for the Atlantic and Arctic seas basins lighthouse involving key players (public and private entities, including SMEs, civil society organisations as well as citizen representatives/citizen assemblies and local communities) at basin level and ensure cooperation and networking of stakeholders for achieving the three objectives[3] of the Mission Ocean, seas and waters; provide networking opportunities and exchanges of good practices within the Atlantic and Arctic seas basins and with other HE Missions and HE Partnerships; liaise and network with other Mission lighthouses to ensure exchanges of good practices and sharing of innovative solutions (cross-fertilisation); liaise with relevant projects implemented by other Missions in the lighthouse area and ensure exchanges of good practices; support the alignment of Regional Smart Specialisation Strategies and Next Generation EU initiatives and projects with the Mission objectives and explore synergies between the Mission and Smart Specialisation strategies and Next Generation EU initiatives and projects;
Communication, monitoring and contribution to overall Mission implementation: design and carry out at basin scale communication actions to promote Mission Ocean, seas and waters and its activities targeting different stakeholders and the general public, both at basin scale and at the regional/local level including in the ‘associated regions’[4]; contribute to monitoring of Mission implementation in the lighthouse area (including a liaison with projects under Mission lighthouse topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-02: Danube river basin lighthouse – restoration of freshwater ecosystems) and provide relevant information and data to the Mission Implementation Platform (see Other actions, Public Procurements, topic Mission Ocean, seas and waters implementation support platform – overall Mission coordination and monitoring; European Blue parks technical assistance; citizen engagement; communication); carry out quantitative and qualitative analysis and studies in relation to the Mission and other relevant activities implemented at basin level; liaise with the Mission Implementation Platform to ensure coherent and timely implementation of the Mission in the lighthouse area;
Develop and foster Atlantic and Arctic seas basins innovation ecosystem: identify R&I needs at basin level; liaise with the ocean and water knowledge system and foster sharing of observation data, information and computing toolboxes; disseminate and raise awareness about suitable innovative solutions to address these needs, (at least 2 dissemination activities per year at a basin level); organise demonstration and testing activities for the innovative solutions (at least 2 activities per year implemented within the basin area); support access to finance and mobilise suitable investors, through e.g.: pitching events, networks of investors, venture capital funds, local Entrepreneurial Discovery processes, etc.; support knowledge and technology transfer, including through training and skill development (at least 2 activities per year at a basin level); support cooperation of lighthouse projects with ‘associated regions[4]’;
Support mission implementation with technical expertise and know-how: develop a coherent catalogue of services providing (on-site or remote) technical expertise and know-how for testing, validating, scaling-up, reproducing, customising and deploying innovative solutions under the lighthouse objective, ensuring interoperability with the Ocean and water knowledge system; develop, make publicly available and curate a catalogue of projects and initiatives funded at EU, national and regional level and to the extent possible, include also privately funded initiatives and projects;
Proposals should include an outreach plan to actively advertise its activities and services to the citizens and local communities and to targeted stakeholders, including to relevant industries and SMEs.
Proposals are expected to build on and integrate all relevant existing governance structures, networks and capacities within the Atlantic and Arctic seas basins, such as organisations involved in All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance as set up under the Galway Statement and Belém Statement and all relevant partners working on the actions in the frame of the All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance, as relevant, as well as on the efforts under the Atlantic Action Plan 2.0., with a view of ensuring comprehensive and inclusive lighthouse governance.
Due to the transboundary nature of waters, basin-scale coordination and cooperation across regions, is required for solutions to be effectively implemented and to resolve shared problems.
Proposals are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission’s objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ‘development and piloting’ phase and 2030 for the ‘deployment and upscaling phase’.

","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Reduced pollution from litter, plastic and microplastic, in the Mediterranean Sea basin in line with the objectives of the EU Zero Pollution Plan and the Convention for the protection of the Mediterranean sea against pollution;
Reduce beach litter to less than 20 items per 100 meters of coastline in line with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requirement;
Accelerated uptake of innovative solutions to prevent and minimize litter, plastic and microplastic pollution;
Effective monitoring of marine litter quantities, in line with EU methodologies, such as Single Use Plastics Directive and assessment of the impact of implemented measures;
Support WFD and MSFD implementation, which provide indicators and mechanism for assessments and measures to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES);
Empowered citizens taking action against pollution.
Scope:
In line with the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan for Air, Water and Soil, proposals should demonstrate scalable breakthrough innovations (technological, business, social and governance) to prevent and minimize marine and freshwater pollution from litter, plastics and microplastics.
Following the zero pollution hierarchy, proposals should focus on demonstrating replicable solutions to prevent and minimise pollution in the Mediterranean Sea including its major river catchment areas and taking into consideration land-sea interactions through measures, such as:
Upstream prevention of litter, plastic and microplastic generation by design;
Substitutes or alternative less polluting substances and materials (especially alternatives to plastics and microplastics) for the most prevalent litter found in freshwater and at sea;
Circular design of fishing gear, including improved reparability and durability (while improving selectivity to reduce discard of bycatches and improved energy efficiency) in close cooperation with the business community in the respective industrial ecosystems;
Solutions for identifying, tracking and recovery of accidental loss of containers and fishing gear;
Efficient collection (incl. in ports and coastal areas), sorting, recycling and re-use of waste, waste water treatment and adequate port reception facilities.
Proposed solutions for pollution prevention, elimination and remediation shouldn’t increase the level of anthropogenic underwater noise.
Proposed solutions should be in line with the EU taxonomy regulation and delegated acts.
Proposals must:
Carry out demonstration activities in 3 different countries of the Mediterranean sea basin, involving and including in the consortium partners from these three countries;
Identify areas and locations where the solutions are replicable and draw up an action plan and roadmap to replicate and scale up the pollution solutions and actions.
To address the impact-driven approach of the Mission and the nature of Innovation Actions, proposals are expected to work with and engage at least 5 ‘associated regions’ to showcase the feasibility, replicability and scale up of the solutions developed within the projects in other areas. ‘Associated regions’ are understood as areas with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities (e.g. neighbouring regions and/or regions in a different sea basin) and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions to to prevent, eliminate and remediate pollution to prevent, eliminate and remediate pollution in the associated regions addressing possible barriers and showing the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions.
The proposals should ensure that the associated regions are located in Member States/Associated countries other than those that are part of the project consortium. An “associated region” must benefit from the Financial Support to Third Parties provided under this topic only once. The partners will proactively reach out to the associated regions to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with those ‘associated regions’ and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement freshwater ecosystem restoration solutions in their territory that contribute to achieving the Mission objectives. The technical assistance to the ’associated regions’ should include the provision of technical advisory services necessary to the prepare roadmaps, plans and projects to prevent, eliminate and remediate pollution in the associated regions addressing possible barriers and showing the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions.
The maximum amount of Financial Support to Third Parties is EUR 100,000 per ’associated region’ for the entire duration of the action. Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness.
The proposals should build on research and innovation developed in the frame of related projects in the current and previous EU framework programmes, such as Horizon 2020, including the activities funded under the Green Deal 2020 call, LIFE and national and regional programmes in the Mediterranean sea basin as well as the activities of the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership[1], as the sea basin initiative WestMed[2] and the macroregional strategy EUSAIR[3], with thematic networks, as well as with the BlueMed Pilot Action on Healthy Plastic Free Mediterranean Sea[4], the implementation of the Union for the Mediterranean Ministerial Declaration on Sustainable Blue Economy as well as projects and actions funded under the PRIMA Partnership[5]. Projects may benefit from the expertise and knowledge of the Joint Research Centre, especially in the areas of large scale monitoring and assessment set-up, technical input on harmonised methodologies and making links with relevant policy frameworks.
The proposals will demonstrate novel methods and social innovation practices resulting in holistic socio-ecological governance and management plans that address the transfer of innovative solutions into the market and economic value/supply chains, by creating commercially viable and investable propositions. The proposals need to build in capacity to reach local/regional and national systems of multi-stakeholders and to enhance their interconnections at basin scale. Multi stakeholder engagements will require active participation from academia to research performing organisations, from citizens to civil society, from young innovators to start-ups, industry, SMEs and other businesses. Activities focused on citizen engagement should also be gender-responsive and include groups at risk of social exclusion to promote a wider uptake of the developed solutions, where relevant.
The projects funded under this topic will address all following issues:
build links with other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the lighthouse and its area to maximize synergies, as well as with the European Blue Parks, other Mission lighthouses;
build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform and with the Mediterranean sea basin lighthouse support facility and platform, for reporting, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities in the lighthouse area as well as with the Blue Parks technical support platform;
support the Ocean and water knowledge system, in particular by contributing to monitoring, modelling and knowledge creation and data.
Proposals are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission’s objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ‘development and piloting’ phase and 2030 for the ‘deployment and upscaling phase’.

","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved understanding of the soil health and food nexus to promote the development of a coherent portfolio of food systems R&I activities in line with the FOOD 2030 initiative.
Further understanding of the interlinkages between farming practices, soil health and four food quality-related characteristics of agri-food products: nutritional composition, tastiness (palatability), their technological properties (i.e. soil health impact on plant characteristics such as protein quality that may affect technological properties and subsequently the final food products) and safety (the level of residues of pesticides, metals or mycotoxins).
Support R&I to facilitate the transition towards healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour. It will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food.
Improved knowledge on how soil health influences food quality (including nutritional composition, tastiness, technological properties and safety) and which methods and tools exist to determine this.
Best practices linking soil health to food quality and how they can be deployed along the food system.
Engaged stakeholders throughout the food system, increased public awareness and business interest on the connection of soil health and food quality, via interactive learning/experimentation through living labs throughout Europe.
Improved links and knowledge transfer with the EJP Soil[1] and other soil-relevant Horizon Europe instruments and initiatives (IBF Microbiome Working Group)[2] at EU and international level.
Scope:
Soils are essential for the global food system and regulate water, carbon and nitrogen cycles but are put under pressure from population growth and climate change. Maintaining healthy soils helps ensure nutritious, tasty and safe foods, which are essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and in particular SDG 2, Zero Hunger.
Soils are an important element in a holistic view of human health. A great proportion of our food comes from terrestrial environments, in which soils play a central role. Soils have an indirect impact on human health as essential soil compounds are taken up by the food produced on it. Unhealthy soils decrease crop harvests and produce crops with reduced nutritional value. Soil contaminants can pose a threat to food safety, malnutrition and human health. Little is known on interactions between nutrient and microbiome composition of soils and the plant (including its secondary metabolite content) and health effects on human diets (including the gut microbiome).
The quality of the soil plays a central role in determining food quality as it provides the substrate and building blocks for the growth of plants and their edible food produce, which are then harvested for consumption. Soil health and soil quality represent a fundamental requirement for food safety, and therefore for animal and human health, even though this relationship is not always acknowledged enough. Growing evidence links farm management, soil health and plant health; but the relationships between soil health, climate stress, food and crop nutritional quality, tastiness (palatability), technological properties and human health are less well understood.
While information already exists on the interaction between farming practices, soil health and food, a structured synthesis is needed to obtain a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the relevant achievements on this field, in order to support the implementation of the soil mission. A clearer understanding of the possible links between soil health, plants, food and people is the key to improving the quality and healthiness of foods grown in all types of farming systems, including smaller scale urban farming. There is a need to build on the existing knowledge resulting from the latest EU R&I activities and infrastructures that elicit the link between soil, food, diets and human health.
Proposed activities will:
Further develop and strengthen legitimacy and robustness of the nexus food quality-soil through an engaged, broad and effective European interdisciplinary community of scientists (including medical researchers), innovators and practitioners, while recognising regional and national specificities, contexts and needs.
Elucidate the current state of knowledge deriving from former and still ongoing Horizon 2020 projects and other relevant state of the art research (e.g., EJP Soil) falling under the the nexus of soils, farming practices, food and human health and identify research and innovation areas where gaps need to be filled.
Catalyse interdisciplinary collaboration as a holistic perspective, which is necessary to address the issues related to the topic.
Seek and integrate qualitative and quantitative scientific evidence through in situ and lab experimentation and testing, literature review, surveys, analytical modelling (etc.) to support farming practices that positively influence the link between soil health and food quality.
Develop easy to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) that elicit the connection between soil health, and four food quality-related characteristics (nutritional composition, tastiness, technological properties and safety).
Adapt, integrate and demonstrate innovative methods to continuously measure the developed KPIs.
Investigate how well current funding opportunities at all levels (EU, national, regional) address soils and human health research and innovation needs.
Build upon existing knowledge and solutions designed and developed from previous projects such as the EIT Food initiative[3] that addresses the challenge of soil health in a holistic way, from farm to fork, involving multiple stakeholders, highlighting their stakes in soil health and identifying potential drivers to motivate them to take action in collaboration with farmers [1] Regenerative Agriculture | EIT Food
Summarise the known factors influencing water, soil and plant health and how these are linked with food quality and human health.
List the potential mechanisms for improved food nutritional quality through soil health and evaluate the current evidence.
Provide conclusions and recommendation for future research and innovation.
Proposals are encouraged to build on past or ongoing EU-funded research and innovation projects. Proposal should also seek collaboration with relevant initiatives, and in particular deliver on key objectives of the Horizon Europe Soil Health and Food Mission.
Proposals should explain how they will deliver co-benefits to the four Food 2030 priorities as well as the EU Soil Strategy for 2030.
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they should collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topic/call, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities and channels.
Proposals should bring together multiple types of scientific expertise in health and natural sciences, and social sciences and humanities. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

","24 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic contributes to the Soil Deal mission’s objective to set up 100 soil health living labs[1] by 2027 that will co-create innovations (all types of innovation including social and technological) to improve soil health in all places, hence helping to restore ecosystems and biodiversity and sustainably manage natural resources. The successful proposal will ensure an effective launch of the first soil health living labs and lighthouses by preparing and supporting stakeholder communities across Member States and Associated countries and ensuring land managers[2], industries, consumers and society at large work together and take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.
More specifically, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
a common understanding of the concept of soil health living labs in relation with mission objectives among potential applicants, including awareness of the selection criteria established for living labs and lighthouses in the implementation plan of the soil mission and of the most pressing soil health challenges in the different parts of Europe;
increased awareness and skills of potential applicants on how to setup and run a soil health living lab and improved access to a pool of capacity building material;
a varied range of proposals to future calls received in terms of geography, soil types and uses, actors involved and coverage of mission objectives, addressing the main soil health challenges faced in the participating regions; and
high-quality, collaborative, multi-actor consortia selected to create the first soil health living labs that meet the criteria established in the mission implementation plan, effectively bringing a range of different actors together in joint proposals within each living lab area or region and across borders to create complementary transnational clusters of living labs.
Scope:
The implementation plan of the Soil Deal mission[3] provides for the gradual creation of 100 soil health living labs in 100 different European regions. The first living labs will be funded through annual calls under the Horizon Europe work programme 2023-2024. These calls will support collaborative projects, each of the projects assembling three to four living labs located in three to four different regions and countries. At the same time, Horizon Europe will also support the creation of a European network coordination body to support stakeholders in creating and running soil health living labs and to organise exchange of knowledge and innovation between them.
The success of the soil mission will depend on how well the community of stakeholders and actors is prepared to implement living labs, in particular the first ones following the 2023-2024 work programme call.
The successful project will organise a stream of support activities including two sets of national engagement sessions complemented by hands-on support of potential applicants based on capacity building material.
The project should work in close cooperation with national and regional authorities, Horizon Europe national contact points (NCPs), mission national hubs, on-going projects preparing for the implementation of the soil mission and structures established at national level on or with interest to soil research and innovation, especially in the context of the European Joint Programme EJP-Soil[4]. It will, in particular, build on the mapping of existing living labs and lighthouses carried out by the Soil Mission Support project (SMS[5]) and on the identification of priority challenges and regional needs for living labs identified by the project to be funded under HORIZON-MISS-2021-SOIL-01-01[6].
Through national engagement sessions the project should:
raise awareness and build ownership of the soil mission’s objectives as well as the definitions, concept and criteria for soil health living labs and lighthouses, as foreseen in the mission’s implementation plan[7];
raise awareness on key soil health challenges identified in the different regions and steer a conversation on the regions or areas and sites which would be most suitable to set up the first living labs in each country;
provide key information and capacity building material on the living lab approach and how to start and run living labs, including a range of different inspiring examples from the EU and beyond;
provide coaching sessions to potential applicants to start testing and improving their initial ideas; and
identify potential applicants and facilitate matchmaking between applicants in various countries to support the creation of transnational proposals for living labs.
To ensure equal opportunities for stakeholders in all countries, these engagement sessions should be organised in all 27 Member States and participating Associated Countries in national languages. The sessions should ensure the participation of a diverse group of actors who are most suitable to take part in soil health living labs, covering various land use types and climatic conditions in a balanced manner (e.g. urban, industrial, forestry and agriculture). In addition, engagement sessions should take into account the mission’s eight specific objectives as described in the mission implementation plan and the diversity of soil challenges in each country.
The two sets of national engagement sessions should take place ideally in the first trimester of 2023 (for call 2023) and in the last trimester of 2023 (for call 2024). A well-developed plan for the organisation of the meetings should be part of the proposal, so that the consortium selected for funding can start the engagement sessions immediately following grant agreement signature. The proposal should include options for physical or hybrid sessions with a digital-only option as a back-up. National engagement sessions should be complemented by a series of capacity-building webinars.
In addition to the national engagement sessions, the successful project will act as a helpdesk to provide on-demand support to stakeholders involved in developing proposals for soil health living labs. It will also produce capacity building material capitalising on the national engagement sessions for future use by other entities engaged in supporting the creation of living labs, notably the aforementioned European network coordination body (to be set up).
The consortium should demonstrate outstanding capacities in terms of participatory approaches, facilitation of groups composed of multiple types of stakeholders with varying backgrounds and expertise, and running of living labs and support networks. To this end, the consortium should be composed of partners with varying expertise and capacities to engage with the relevant actors expected to take part in future living labs. The consortium should also include members with a sound understanding of the subject of soil health.
The successful project is expected to last two years. In addition to its collaboration with the Horizon 2020 project SMS and the project funded under HORIZON-MISS-2021-SOIL-01-01, it should work in close coordination and synergy with the mission secretariat. The project should also engage with relevant innovation networks (Smart specialisation platforms, EIP-AGRI, European Institute of Technology and its knowledge and innovation communities (KICs), Enterprise Europe network etc.). Applicants should take note of the content of the mission’s implementation plan and be flexible enough to accommodate some adjustments to developments that will have happened between the publication of this call and the grant agreement signature, especially on living lab definitions and selection criteria.

The aim is to select and support a limited number of intermediaries in the greatest number of Member States, capable of building the capacities of a large number of civil society organisations active at local, regional and/or national level in the fields covered by the CERV programme, including through providing them with financial support.
Proposals must include both categories of activities:
Financial support to third parties (CSOs) by intermediaries
Capacity building for CSOs
Intermediaries should give priority to small, remote and rural based organisations which tend to have more limited capacity and funding sources.
Only activities complying with and promoting the principles of the rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy may be funded.
Please see the Call document for more information."

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The farm to fork strategy aims to accelerate the transition to sustainable farming and food systems by, inter alia, promoting the growth of organic farming with a view to achieve the target of at least 25% of the EU’s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030. Moreover, the strategy envisages the strengthening of geographical indications (GIs), by including specific sustainability criteria, where appropriate. One of the strategy’s main priorities is to combat food fraud along the food supply chain. The successful proposals should therefore contribute to preventing food fraud of products with quality labels, in particular organic and GIs. In this way, they should facilitate progress towards the strategy’s challenging target for organic farming and strengthen the GIs scheme.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
a wider use of new and improved tools and field-deployable methods and approaches for rapid and cost-effective verification of claims related to food products of plant and animal origin with quality labels, in particular organic and GIs;
unlocked potential of new technologies and other innovative approaches (e.g., business models) fit for farmers and food businesses (especially small-scale farmers and small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs)) as well as policymakers, which cost-effectively enable traceability and transparency along the supply chains of quality labelled food, in particular those with organic and GIs labels;
improved functioning and effectiveness of the control systems in Member States and Associated Counties and the EU’s legislative framework for organic and GI food products;
increased data availability, interoperability and use, and improved analytical capacity for enhanced traceability and transparency along the supply chains of quality labelled food, in particular organic and GIs;
well-informed decision-making by farmers, food businesses and policymakers to improve climate, environmental, economic and social sustainability along the supply chains of quality labelled food, in particular organic and GIs.
Scope:
Quality labelled food products, such as organic and GIs, are generally more expensive than their counterparts. Therefore, foods with such quality labels are particularly prone to fraud. Illegal practices can considerably harm the quality schemes, as they can undermine consumer confidence, thus damaging the farmers and food businesses who respect the rules. The main challenge is that it is difficult for consumers and operators across supply chains to visually distinguish genuine from false organic or GI products. Traditional methods of determining food quality are time consuming and usually require special laboratory analyses, which are often costly and may not be sufficient to guarantee a product’s authenticity and traceability. In addition, as organic and GI food supply chains become more complex, the need to ensure product traceability and transparency along the entire chain increases. Existing traceability and control systems help track products throughout the food supply chain and improve transparency. However, the organic and GI sectors rapidly change due to, for example, widespread use of e-commerce, and given the expected growth of these sectors, the risk of fraud may increase. Therefore, it is important to continuously innovate and upgrade the approaches to prevent fraudulent practices. Diverse new technologies and other innovative solutions (e.g., business models; participatory certification; local, short or mid-tier supply chains; etc.), are emerging to improve the authentication and traceability of quality labelled food products, in particular those with organic and GI labels, as well as to increase transparency of supply chains, thereby contributing to combating fraud. These innovative solutions need to be developed/improved, tested, demonstrated and deployed.
Proposals should investigate the current fraud practices affecting quality labelled food products, in particular organic and GI, and analyse the root causes/drivers of these practices and obstacles and ways to eradicate them. Based on these insights and building on the state-of-the-art in research and innovation, proposals should develop/improve, test, demonstrate and pilot promising innovative low-cost methods, tools and approaches to authenticate and/or trace quality labelled food products, especially organic and GIs, as well as to improve transparency of their supply chains from farm to fork. They should explore the potential of various technological and non-technological innovative solutions (e.g., digital (such as photonics, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, internet of things (IoT), machine learning, etc.), new business models (in particular involving and suitable for small-scale farmers and SMEs), suitable reference materials, rapid and field-deployable, non-destructive testing methods, technologies to improve cybersecurity, etc.), and their combinations. The heterogeneity of products and sectors, as well as the diversity of supply chains and contexts should be taken into account. Proposals should also investigate the barriers and incentives to scaling up the use of the innovative solutions as well as assess the positive and negative impacts on the different operations and actors in the organic and GI food value chains, particular attention should be paid to small-scale farmers, SMEs and consumers, as well as the control systems used in Member States and Associated Countries. Proposals should also develop a system to increase availability of and access to relevant data, promote data harmonisation and improve the ways in which data are stored. In addition, they should explore ways to advance the analysis, use, interoperability and security of data to enhance fair transparency and support better decision-making, to improve sustainability along organic and GI food supply chains.
The innovative solutions should be widely disseminated and recommendations for relevant actors in the public sector and business should be provided. Close involvement and consultation with project advisory board members is recommended. Projects should use the 'multi-actor approach', ensuring adequate involvement of all relevant actors, including input suppliers, farmers and SMEs. Proposals may build on existing research infrastructures, where relevant. Proposals are encouraged to build on past and ongoing EU-funded research and innovation projects, and are strongly encouraged to cluster with upcoming projects under the HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-10, HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-01-11 and HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-17 topics. They are also encouraged to cooperate with actors working on related initiatives, including the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality, which provides expertise in food science, authenticity and quality of food supplied in the EU. The possible participation/contribution of the JRC in the project would consist of ensuring that the project deliverables are compatible with and/or improve existing databases and tools used at the European Commission and fostering open access to project results via dissemination through the European Commission Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality.

","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will contribute to the EU’s goal of leading just, digital, economic and ecological transitions that will leave no one behind, supporting in particular European Green Deal priorities such as the biodiversity strategy for 2030. R&I will support the development of nature-based therapy to help communities turn the ecological transition into opportunities for good health and well-being, increased resilience, and positive long-term prospects such as the creation of green jobs.
Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Sharper view of green space management, nature protection, agriculture and forestry sectors as care providers and their possible linkages with the healthcare, social and educational sectors;
Stronger evidence base for the causal relationships between nature and health and well-being for more effective nature therapy prescriptions;
Cost-effective nature therapy prescriptions are more widely used in the health care sector;
Greater citizen and policy-maker awareness of the positive benefits of nature for health and well-being;
Wider utilization by healthcare professionals and citizens of nature therapy as a form of preventive medicine.
Scope:
Nature affects human health in different ways. In particular, urban environments can have a negative impact on physical and mental health. This is due to urban stressors such as increased noise levels, higher crime rates and higher levels of pollution. The total global burden of disease attributable to mental illness has recently been estimated to be as high as 32% of total years lived with disability and 13% of disability-adjusted life-years, on par with cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. It is important, therefore, to determine the degree to which nature experience might lessen and address this burden. Even more so in view of the fact that the opportunities and time spent in nature are decreasing.
However, despite many putative positive correlations identified between nature and health and well-being, the causal understanding of relationships between health and nature exposure are not well understood. The long-term effects are also less well studied and recognised in policies. Social, economic and cultural factors strongly mediate the strength and direction of linkages between health and nature. Age, gender and especially socio-economic status may modify the association between greenness and health behaviours and outcomes and need to be better understood to create more effective nature therapy. Additionally, mental health benefits may vary with the type of interaction with nature and the form of sensory input. Furthermore, the health and well-being benefits of exposure to nature are affected by cultural perspectives and experiences relating to social interaction and contact with the natural environment.
A successful proposal should:
Develop a common framework to increasingly recognise and promote contact with nature, including protected areas and other green and blue spaces, as a cost-effective response for the prevention and treatment of human health and well-being;
Propose an interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach, including the involvement of the health care sector, land owners, as well as green space management and nature protection sectors;
Improve schemes monitoring nature-health linkages to enhance the evidence base and tools for the health care sector, green space management, nature protection, urban planning and landscape architecture;
Develop longitudinal prospective methods, (quasi-) experiments or well-controlled interventions, to provide more evidence of the causal relationships between nature and health and well-being:
Understanding of when people explicitly choose to go to an urban green space and what experiences they have there (e.g., active versus passive activities).
Determining the type of interactions and dose of interactions necessary for long-term health and well-being benefits.
Understanding the mediators of the health-nature relationship, such as age, gender, socio-economic status or culture.
Considering the difference between greenness quantity and quality and determining which aspects of natural features are relevant to mental health.
Understanding how different geographical locations and factors such as population density affect the health-nature relationships;
Test nature therapy sessions, identify best-practices and develop the necessary tools and guidelines for integration of nature-based care in the public health sector;
Identify legal and administrative arrangements, partnerships, and financial mechanisms for implementation of nature therapy sessions.
The proposals should address all of the above points.
Proposals should bring together from the start multiple types of scientific expertise in both health and natural sciences, as well as social sciences and humanities, together with a variety of community and health sector representatives, businesses, civil society organisations and citizens.
Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information and project outputs will be accessible through the Oppla portal (the EU repository for nature-based solutions)[1].
Applicants should create synergies with projects under the same topic and other relevant ongoing or up-coming projects, notably the Horizon 2020 NBS project portfolio and its task forces; HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-05: The economics of nature-based solutions: cost-benefit analysis, market development and funding; HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-03: Network for nature: multi-stakeholder dialogue platform to promote nature-based solutions; HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-05: Assessing the socio-politics of nature-based solutions for more inclusive and resilient communities; HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-06: Inside and outside: educational innovation with nature-based solutions. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, foresee joint activities and joint deliverables.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with the USA, Japan and the LAC region.

Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Contribution to the overarching objective of launch cost/price reduction by 50% by 2030 (with respect to A6/VegaC cost/price 2021 economic conditions), for the benefit of EU Space programmes implementation and towards reinforcing EU‘s independent capacity to access to space.
Innovation acceleration of enabling technologies (maturing, assessing and practicing, through representative in flight experiments).
Matured technologies up to TRL5/6, integration of system tests vehicle, on-ground and low altitude system tests by 2023 and contribution to the preparation of suborbital system tests potentially in 2025.
Cost reduction investigation and system tests.
These outcomes will contribute to enhance EU strategic autonomy and sector competitiveness, in line with the Expected Impact of the destination.
Scope:
Cost reduction and improving flexibility of European launch systems are the main challenges in order to foster European industry competitiveness on the global market.
R&I will focus on reusability concepts including required technologies that have a strong potential for cost reduction, starting with the recovery of the most expensive components such as first stage. It can also increase launch flexibility by reducing lead-time from order to launch by helping to adapt efficiently the launch rate and the performance to market variations. In addition, reusability would contribute to align space economy with the ecological transition to sustainability.
The activities will address technologies and building blocks maturation up to TRL5/6 and subsystem/system tests including system, vehicle integration, ground tests, low altitude flight system tests by 2023 and contribution to the preparation up to ground based system tests of suborbital flight system tests by 2025. The execution of the suborbital tests is not part of the scope.
The developed enabling technologies and building blocks should be applicable to strategic launchers able to launch EU Space Programme components, with the objective of enabling operational capacities by 2030. The system tests vehicle should be representative of a reusable 1st stage of a strategic EU launcher. This vehicle should be at a sufficiently large scale in order to be representative of the expected final capacities. The vehicle will be equipped with a reusable propulsion system.
The proposed activities must also support EU non-dependence objective and include the assessment of costs reduction investigations and system tests results towards the overarching objective mentioned in the expected outcomes.
The activities will address enabling technologies maturation and demonstration at least in all of the following areas:
low cost GNC and avionics (hybridation techniques, navigation sensors, modular, reconfigurable),
manoeuvring control devices,
Health Monitoring System (HMS), propellant management,
aerodynamic devices,
descent and landing/recovery systems, including low latency, closed loop communication systems for landing,
on-ground servicing processes (refurbishment, check-out supported by automatic post flight analysis and repair and recertification for reused elements),
safety critical processes before launch and after landing.
The activities should include as many as technologies possible in each area to maximise the number of matured technologies to be submitted to integrated tests at system level (all technologies together).
All the activities should be complementary and coherent with the ESA on-going or future activities in particular those decided at the last ESA Ministerial held in November 2019. Proposals should provide all IPR dependencies and dependencies with other on-going activities, and detail the implementation, the reporting and the organisational as well as steering measures that will be taken to ensure that the proposed activities can be implemented and can achieve all the expected outcomes within the project schedule and budget.

","16 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Enable the industrialisation and new services in space by intelligent solutions and concepts, exploiting synergies with terrestrial sectors and cultivating an AppStore and Open-Architecture mentality.
Therefore, automation, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) especially in combination with standardisation, modularisation and digitalisation are key enablers, improving space systems and satellites’ flexibility and cost-efficiency, increasing sustainability and accessibility, introducing mass-customisation and cooperative design as well as simplifying operations.
Each project is expected to contribute to one or several of the following outcomes:
A future space ecosystem, fostering the industrialisation and business in space as well as supporting scientifically meaningful missions by using synergies with terrestrial sectors, building on spacecraft modularity, simplifying operations and make plug-and-play modules more common as well as enabling on-orbit services such as maintenance, assembly, manufacturing, re-configuration, recycling, logistics, warehousing, etc.
Game-changing technologies, tools and processes enhancing on-orbit servicing applications and contribute to the protection of the in-space future ecosystem (e.g. debris mitigation).
A paradigm shift towards sustainable, highly automated, flexible and economical viable space infrastructure, to maximise commercial opportunities in space and on Earth.
This will contribute to, in the medium to long term, developing, deploying global space-based services and contribute to fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness, as stated in the expected impact of this destination.
Scope:
The areas of R&I, which need to be addressed to tackle the above expected outcomes are:
1) R&I on new scalable satellite platform concepts and building blocks increasing the degree of satellite modularisation. Aiming at intelligent, adaptable and maintainable systems with plug-and-play compartmentalised functionalities (modules) that will introduce both, on-orbit re-configuration and re-use/re-cycling of spacecraft parts fostering debris mitigation, as well as increased system redundancy, inherently. The approach should consider an innovative, scalable and adaptive framework concept for a ‘European construction kit for satellite systems and applications’, following the AppStore approach and fostering development of compartmentalised functionalities (modules) for satellite systems independently from mission. The framework should address the needs from building block developers as well as from end-users. As one result, functional satellite modules (Orbital Replaceable Units to deliver new/enhanced functionality) should be developed (TRL 5-6) to upgrade the satellite platform of the orbital demonstration mission[1] by using pre-existing standard interfaces[2] (plug-and-play concept). The module design should support the integration of different pre-existing standard interfaces113. Further reference is given in a technical guidance document applicable to this area[3].
2) R&I on new on-orbit services concepts concentrating on a next generation of potential business cases (e.g. satellite recycling, transfer services, logistics, warehousing, etc.) contributing to a sustainable space infrastructure and in-space ecosystem development. Work should include, but not be limited to, market & trend analyses, design of mission and system architecture, and feasibility studies.
3) R&I to identify, develop and implement AI and industry 4.0 means (e.g. virtual design, digital twins, virtual testing) in order to attain Rapid Development, Production and Assembly Integration and Testing (AIT) processes in satellite life cycle.
Proposals should explore relevant and promising solutions derived in Horizon 2020 activities, especially project results from the Strategic Research Clusters Space Robotics Technologies[4] and Electric Propulsion[5].
A proposal may address more than one area but must indicate the main area addressed, and is expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial space usage.
To ensure a balanced portfolio covering the three areas described above, grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but at least also to one project that is the highest ranked within each area, provided that the applications attain all thresholds.

Current water allocation regimes are largely shaped by historical preferences and usage patterns. They are therefore usually not well equipped to deal with the growing water needs and intensifying competition of the different water use sectors, the impacts of climate changes, especially water scarcity and/or shifts in societal preferences, such as increasing value placed on water related ecological services. It is therefore important to assess current water allocation systems in different regions and sectors and to develop pertinent water allocation models that are able to perform well under both average and extreme conditions and could demonstrate adaptive efficiency in order to adjust to climate conditions.
Actions under this topic should address ways to value water appropriately, taking into account the multiple and diverse values of water to different groups and sectors, and ways to develop appropriate tariffs and prices to ensure access to water which should be available and affordable to all, while also securing adequate pricing policies allowing for systematic renewal of water service infrastructure. Actions should develop and demonstrate in relevant river basins and sectors, innovative tools / instruments on intelligent water allocation schemes relevant for decision-making recommendations (e.g. on permits). The opportunities for developing water allocation schemes based on digital technologies should be explored.
The challenges for water allocation regimes, especially in developing countries, are also aggravated by weak water policies which contributes to structural water scarcity, increasing the risk of shortages for users and the environment. The interaction of policies, regulation and implementation mechanisms should be especially assessed, as well as, the interplay between conventional and non-conventional water resources (e.g. wastewater reuse, desalination, etc.).
Water allocation scheme in transboundary river basins should also be addressed with a view to developing an internationally accepted and standardised mechanism for allocation of water in cross-border river basins, by taking into account the various socio-economic and environmental disparities among these countries and making transboundary waters an area of cooperation rather than conflict.
Climate change impacts on freshwater resources can have significant impacts on agricultural production resulting in destabilising effects on agricultural markets, food security and other non-agricultural uses. Current water allocation regimes in agriculture should be reviewed in this context, with a view to developing the necessary combination of various adaptation measures, such as, water pricing, water use restrictions, improvement of water use efficiency, economic incentives, water reuse, shifting to less water-requiring crops and fallowing, etc., to cope with the reduction of water availability anticipated in climate change scenarios.
International cooperation with non-associated third countries with transboundary rivers is encouraged.
In general, the participation of academia, research organisations, utilities, industry and regulators is strongly advised, as well as civil society engagement whenever necessary, also aiming to broaden the dissemination and exploitation routes and to better assess the innovation potential of developed solutions and strategies.

","28 October 2021
","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of rural areas, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal[1], the EU farm to fork strategy[2], the European pillar of social rights[3], the European gender equality strategy[4] and the EU long-term vision for rural areas[5]. It will do so by increasing the understanding of the social and behavioural drivers of change, especially in relation with gender norms and relations and by favouring the deployment of women-led innovations in farming and rural communities. Improved knowledge of the specifics of women-led innovation, more supportive innovation ecosystems and smart solutions coming from women-led innovations will empower rural people to act for change and get farming and rural communities prepared to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, adapt to climate change, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience, good health and positive long-term prospects, including jobs for all, in particular women.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
more effective policy and governance frameworks and knowledge and innovation systems to boost women’s roles in the sustainable development of rural areas and in innovation in farming, in the rural economy and in rural communities;
improved understanding, awareness and recognition of women’s role in the future of the farming sector (in particular ecological transitions), rural economies and communities and related innovation by policy-makers, rural citizens, innovation support services and scientists;
combating and transforming gender norms and stereotypes, fostering broad social equalities and advancing Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality; and
enhanced capacity of rural women to innovate for change, including improved skills, solutions to challenges faced by rural women, stronger networks and enhanced knowledge flows from, between and towards women innovators in rural areas and in farming, facilitating the uptake and dissemination of successful innovations and innovation-support tools, in particular those contributing to ecological transitions.
Scope:
The role that European women play in rural development and in farming is still widely under-researched. And so is their role as entrepreneurs and innovation leaders, the specifics of the innovations they develop and how the current governance framework contributes to boosting their innovation capacity or to hampering it. Current evidence suggests that this role is underestimated and that the potential of rural women to contribute to sustainability transitions remains partially untapped, in particular due to a lack of targeting in policy frameworks and innovation support systems.
Proposals should analyse the role that women play and will play in the future of rural areas considering megatrends in European rural economies and communities in general and in farming in particular (proportion of official and non-official farm labour, involvement in innovative activities, role in social capital, specific social challenges and risks, relation to environment and environmentally-friendly farming practices etc.), highlighting differences between and within studied countries. They should analyse the specifics of women-led or gendered innovations in farming and in rural communities (specific needs and challenges, sectors and activities, scope, outcomes and benefits, hurdles and obstacles, knowledge and support sources and various forms of social capital involved), the relevance of the agricultural and rural knowledge and innovation systems for women, including education, training and advice. To this end, proposals should actively support a number of practical user-centred women-led interactive innovation initiatives to create knowledge of the specifics of women-led innovation processes, favour exchanges across initiatives and derive new knowledge and practical tools for women, support organisations and policy makers at national (including Associated Countries) and EU level to enhance change.
Proposals should benchmark EU and national policy and legal frameworks on farming and rural development for their gender equality performance, taking into account the new European gender equality strategy. They should also formulate recommendations on how to improve legal, policy or governance frameworks in rural economies in general and in farming in particular to support women-led innovation and women’s role in farming and rural economies.
Proposals should be transdisciplinary, with a key role for social sciences and humanities (SSH) such as sociology, psychology, economics and innovation studies. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines. Social innovation should be considered alongside other types of innovation[6]. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach, involving women rural innovators and supportive organisations in all tasks alongside scientists, innovation support services and other relevant actors all along the project. The consortia and practical innovation initiatives supported should be located in a set of different locations representing the diversity of European rural socio-economic conditions. Proposals should include a task to coordinate with other proposals funded under this topic, as well as under topics on the ‘expertise and training centre on rural innovation’ (HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-02), ‘smart solutions for smart rural communities’ (HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-02-01-two-stage), other relevant projects[7] and with future common agricultural policy networks[8], to build synergies in engagement activities and dissemination and exploitation of results.

The successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of rural areas, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal[1], in particular its fair and just transition component, the European digital strategy[2], the European pillar of social rights[3] and the EU long-term vision for rural areas[4]. It will do so by supporting digital, social and community-led innovations and by equipping rural communities with innovative and smarter solutions that increase access to services, opportunities and adequate innovation ecosystems, including for women, youth and the most vulnerable groups, improve attractiveness and reduce the feeling of being left behind, even in the most remote locations like mountains. The increased availability of smart solutions and support to community-led innovations will empower people to act for change and get prepared to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, adapt to climate change, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience, good health and positive long-term prospects, including jobs, for all including women, young people and vulnerable groups.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced capacity of rural communities and rural people to innovate for change thanks to the specific outcomes below;
Enlarged set of smart solutions for rural communities (practical and transferable innovative solutions to challenges faced by rural communities in a variety of fields e.g. social services, health, energy, mobility, climate adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity and ecosystem management, education, access to culture, etc.).
Upgraded approaches, methods, tools and skills to design, implement, monitor and evaluate community-led innovations contributing to the implementation of smart village[5] strategies and social innovation[6] initiatives improving i) rural people’s well-being, ii) rural community resilience to shocks, iii) rural contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and to the EU long-term vision for rural areas[7].
Strengthened human capital, including networks, enhanced relations and knowledge exchange between smart villages and rural community innovators on transferable innovations and innovation processes.
Scope:
Proposals should start from past work conducted in the framework of i) EU action on smart villages[8], including the related preparatory actions[9]; and ii) Horizon 2020 projects dedicated to social innovation in rural areas[10]. Proposals should support a large number of rural community-led, social innovation or smart village pilot initiatives in a set of locations in the EU and Associated Countries representative of the diversity of social and geographical contexts. They should prototype, test, pilot and demonstrate innovations that answer the most pressing rural challenges found at these locations, with particular attention to social and environmental challenges.
Proposals should explore various forms of innovations: technical, technological, business, organisational and social. Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the interface between social and technical solutions and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. Proposals should exploit in particular the potential of digital technologies to answer rural communities’ challenges, respecting the principles of the declarations on “joining forces to boost sustainable digital transformation in cities and communities”[11] and on “a smart and sustainable digital future for European agriculture and rural areas”[12]. Proposals should build on the work of projects funded under the topic DT-ICT-09-2020[13] and avoid duplications.
Criteria for selecting the pilot initiatives supported should include the contribution to rural people’s well-being, rural community resilience to shocks, Sustainable Development Goals and the EU’s long-term vision for rural areas as well as the potential transferability or replicability of the innovations to other European villages facing similar conditions. The experience gained from supporting these community-led innovation pilot initiatives should lead proposals to formulate upgraded approaches, methods and tools that should be widely disseminated in close coordination with the ‘expertise and training centre on rural innovation funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-02. Proposals should also capitalise on i) rural innovation processes and knowledge and innovation systems or ecosystems needed to support rural community-led or social innovation and smart villages; and ii) lessons learnt to improve policies and governance frameworks, especially on instruments supporting the development of social capital, social networks, social economy and social innovation and with attention to various needs of various target groups.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach, bringing together scientists alongside rural community organisations, action groups or networks with a demonstrated ability to connect to a large number of local communities and disseminate and exploit project results. The consortium should bring together a multiplicity of competences and science disciplines with an effective contribution of SSH disciplines, to ensure a skilled accompaniment of a wide range of innovation areas likely to come from the pilot initiatives (climate mitigation and adaptation, social care and services, energy, mobility, culture, education etc.) and innovation approaches and technologies (technical, organisational, social, digital…). It should demonstrate substantial prior experience in facilitating community-led bottom-up innovation initiatives.
As an option, proposals may provide financial support to third parties, particularly for SMEs or entities who would develop specific innovative solutions needed in the pilot initiatives. Consortia who decide to use this option should define the selection process of entities for which financial support will be granted.
Proposals should include a task to cooperate with other projects funded under this topic, other relevant innovation projects and with the ‘expertise and training centre on rural innovation’ funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-02 from the beginning of the project (taking up tools and training kits) until its end (dissemination of upgraded tools and smart solutions) and with the projects funded under HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-01 for issues related to women-led innovation. Proposals should also foresee close coordination with the common agricultural policy networks[14] to maximise the contribution of project activities to the achievement of future common agricultural policy (2021-2027) objectives[15], in particular in relation with smart villages[16]. Finally, proposals are encouraged to liaise with the relevant European Institute of Technology knowledge and innovation communities[17].

In line with the European Green Deal climate ambition, project implementation is expected to contribute to mitigation and adaptation to climate change and help achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Establishment of a comprehensive capacity to observe the short-term to long-term drivers of change and their impacts on agriculture in key areas;
Better informed policies and strategies regarding mitigation and adaptation to climate change;
Better resilience of European food security to shocks such as those arising from various drivers of change, including climate change, including through the development of strategies and policies.
Scope:
Resilience of the farming sector to exogenous shocks needs to be boosted. Impacts of climate change in the short- to medium-term are gaining more importance and there is an urgent need to develop resilience strategies. It is also necessary to set up a capacity to observe the short-term to long-term impacts of climate change and reinforce strategies to deal with those impacts.
An observatory of the impacts of drivers of change on food security should be set up. The observatory should cover at least the following issues related to the impact of climate change: 1) biodiversity and genetic resources, with a focus on agro-biodiversity and invasive species and genetic resources under pressure as a consequence of climate change and 2) sustainable productivity (including impact on photosynthesis), animal and plant diseases and nutritional composition
The observatory should make use of various types of data, at various geographical scales and should include, as appropriate, citizen observations. It should cover the main biogeographical regions of Europe;
The observatory should contribute to establish / reinforce strategies to deal with those impacts.
The impact of shocks should be modelled as relevant for use in policy-relevant areas in order to improve resilience of the agro-food sector.
Project should contribute to the development of a contingency plan for ensuring food supply and food security that is to be put in place in times of crisis as foreseen in the farm to fork strategy.
Case study strategies should be developed in a participatory manner to foster the resilience in the short- to long term at various geographic scales. These resilience strategies should also take into account the mitigation and adaptation objectives of the EU. Preparation of the strategies may be supported through grants to third parties. In this case, the proposal must define the process of selecting entities for which financial support will be granted, typically in the order of 60.000 – 200.000 EUR per party. It is expected that up to 30% of requested EU contribution will be devoted to grants to third parties.
Proposals should ensure that the approach proposed is compatible with and improves the tools used at the European Commission.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will ensure that the approach proposed will be compatible with and improve the tools used at the European Commission

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as of the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support the development of policies, business models and market conditions contributing to the sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of urban and peri-urban areas and to the empowerment and resilience of their communities, who can access, afford and choose healthier, nutritious and environmental-friendly food.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
The concept of urban food-sharing economy and of its impacts on the society, the planet and the economy at urban and peri-urban level are better understood, as well as the drivers to its development and the implementation gaps;
Urban and peri-urban communities develop or strengthen their food-sharing economies as a step towards more innovative, inclusive, sustainable and resilient local food systems and supply chains that can also address emerging problems, such as the challenges posed by the measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic;
Prevention and reduction of food waste.
Scope:
With the recent Covid-19 pandemic, it is now evident that the risk of disruptions of food systems needs to be given greater attention. Strengthening the resilience of communities (in particular the most vulnerable and isolated, and those at risk of food poverty) to potential food system disruptions is at the heart of this topic.
The Pandemic has contributed to the emergence of territorialised and community-based food economies spontaneously created by citizens. These new sharing and circular economies are based on the redistribution of value, knowledge-sharing and reciprocal support, and are often supported by local governments.
Urban food sharing initiatives have been multiplying across a wide range of diversified cities, far beyond the wealthiest ones, and are often facilitated by new technologies such as apps, websites and social media. Such initiatives develop strategies that support an increase in resilience, social justice and empowerment of vulnerable and marginalised populations.
However, urban food sharing is still an unexplored – and debated – field; there is currently no agreed definition and many activities can be considered as part of it (e.g., kitchen spaces, meal sharing, food business incubators, collaborative delivery services, food donation). The lack of political interest, financing and sufficient data, as well as the existence of regulatory barriers and risks (both real and perceived), are holding back the rise of new food systems economies that work for all people and the planet.
The proposals should foster social innovation, with a special focus on building a more widespread and resilient food sharing economy, where different practices can be considered, while working on 5 distinct areas:
Mapping, tracking and monitoring: building on the work of the EU-funded project ‘Sharecity’[1], proposals should investigate the food sharing landscapes of at least 100 EU/Associated Countries cities to understand how food sharing landscapes differ within and across countries; moreover, proposals should develop automated systems to search, collect and – especially – update existing urban and peri-urban initiatives;
Cost-benefit analysis: proposals should define appropriate measures and indicators to assess the social, economic and environmental benefits of urban and peri-urban food sharing, including developing new indices to describe the specificity of food sharing economy. This should include the production of new knowledge on the challenges, implementation gaps and innovative mechanisms to foster for sustainable food sharing in cities, towns and neighbourhoods;
Comparative governance analysis: proposals should investigate how different food sharing landscapes evolve and, also through a scenario analysis, how to transform the existing regulatory regimes, governance structures and habits, to promote sustainable food sharing;
Strategic planning: proposals should exploit the potential for replicability/scale up of existing food sharing initiatives across the EU and associated countries and bring innovation into urban food systems design to integrate sustainable food sharing and build the urban food systems of the future;
Challenging the existing theories: proposals should study the relationship between the evolution of social norms, culture and local conditions, including their change due to the global pandemics, and the rise of food sharing initiatives.
Furthermore, proposals should support the definition of innovative local strategies to overcome the barriers to food and nutrition security in urban areas and boost community resilience. This can include the creation and evaluation of distributive food systems (e.g. mutual aid programmes, local food systems networks) based on local needs and capacities, where value, knowledge and power would be redistributed fairly across actors and territories; tailored solutions - including social innovations, frugal innovation, technologies, new/adapted business models -, as well as new market places.
Proposals should address inequalities in urban food systems, whether they be due to gender, race and other social categories.
Proposals should implement the multi-actor approach by conducting inter and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide diversity of food system actors, with a special attention to consumers and civil society organisations. They should ensure a strong involvement of citizens and civil society, as well as of academia, industry and public authorities in the development of the methods and approaches to innovation.
Proposals should explain and map how the co-benefits relevant to the four Food 2030 priorities will be achieved: Nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, Climate and environment, Circularity and resource efficiency, Innovation and empowerment of communities.
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they will collaborate with other proposals selected under this and any other relevant topic/call, e. g. by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

The successful proposal will be in line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as with the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050. It will support R&I to foster advances in microbiome-related research for more sustainable agricultural food production. This in turn will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
More nutritious and diverse plant-based food produce and products, based upon diverse microbiomes.
Knowledge that leads to microbiome based understanding as needed by the industry on the interaction of plants (e.g. secondary metabolites) and of plant microbiomes with animal and human microbiomes. This is within the context of animal/human health effects, and of plants hosting plant/human/animal pathogens or other microorganisms causing quality and safety problems.
Enhanced ""translational research"", which generates and applies knowledge that can improve human health and environmental practices and contributes to yield stability and food and nutrition security.
Strengthened relationships between all actors involved in our food systems (e.g. farmers, and consumers) by offering transparency of business strategies, including related integrated assessments and decision support tools.
Scope:
Diversity is increasingly important and is fundamental to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3, 12, 13, 14 and 15. To introduce such diversity there is a need to implement research and innovation, education, communication, regulation and policy at (multi-)national and European level addressing existing food systems-related microbiome research gaps from laboratory to the field to food production ecosystems. This includes the interaction of food chain microbiome components from the soil to the plant/animal to the plate. We require a better understanding of the interaction of microbial biodiversity of plant/animal/human microbiomes and other biological processes in the larger food and animal/human health context. This is based upon an understanding that plant/animal/human microbiome/ microbiota comprises all microorganisms, including pathogens, and beneficial microorganisms.
The scope covers plant/animal/human/food microbiome interactions that can provide healthier food and reduce human health and environmental risks, and contribute to restoring biodiversity, enhanced circularity, and climate change adaptation.
A better understanding of the potential (direct or indirect) interactions between plant/ animal/human/food microbiomes should be achieved. Successful proposals should directly link their R&I coverage with other related intervention actions developing microbiome products and knowledge. In the medium term, food products grown and processed under optimised conditions favouring positive interactions with the microbiome must be harvested and delivered at comparable costs to those originating in today's conventional farming or intensive agriculture systems. This should be achieved while ensuring that the microbiome-solutions have low risk for consumers, farmers and other users, and the environment, maintaining the economic balance of production facilities and preventing dramatic economic losses, in particular to primary producers. New products may seek EU market regulatory approval, thus proposals should address relevant EU regulatory requirements as well as EFSA safety guidance and risk assessment and health outcomes verification.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
The characterisation and development of microbiomes and their downstream products providing dietary diversity for improved human and animal health, and resilient food production systems.
Mapping and provision of the arising co-benefits relevant to the four Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy plant-based food and feed as well as those relevant to different socio-economic and cultural groups.
Increasing knowledge and understanding of the biological and ecological processes involved in the assembly and dynamics of plant microbial communities, particularly microbial invasion and persistence, all along the production chains to deploy microbiota shaping-based strategies to improve the quality and safety of food products.
Designing multi-objective multi-region microbiome/diet transition pathways for EU food systems, gathering all aspects of sustainable food systems and diets, health and safety parameters, biodiversity climate and environmental factors, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowerment of communities, traditional and cultural resources.
Seek international cooperation (such as with the International Bioeconomy Forum, the ‘one planet sustainable food systems’ programme, etc.), along with early and wide communication of microbiome science and applications.
Address food industry needs, particularly personnel training in classical microbiology and modern microbiome skills; the closing of regulatory loopholes for microbial products; and the demarcation of research levels providing better differentiation to the companies developing the products.
The required multi-actor approach (see eligibility conditions) must be implemented by involving a wide diversity of food system actors and conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research engaging consumers and civil society organisations. Proposals are encouraged to build on past or ongoing EU-funded research, research infrastructures and collaborate with relevant initiatives, including the Horizon Europe mission in the area of soil health and food international cooperation, the International Bioeconomy Forum, the ‘one planet sustainable food systems’ programme, etc. The proposals should set out a clear plan on how it will collaborate with other related proposals selected under this and any other relevant topic/call, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities.

It will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shifts, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Improving public health by introducing improved NCDs biomarkers.
Better understanding of human (male and female) physiology, metabolic regulation and the links between all aspects of nutrition and health, microbiome and disease development.
Robust and reliable knowledge base on variations in human health in response to nutrition and other relevant factors. Translation of this knowledge into innovative and effective food and nutrition solutions to improve people’s health and wellbeing in ways that are adapted to women and to men, while simultaneously taking into account other dimensions of sustainability such as climate and the environment.
Comprehensive evidence base on links between nutrition/health and disease by conducting hypothesis-driven studies and adopting more integrated research approaches.
Improved public awareness and a healthier diet which will reduce NCDs in particular in vulnerable population groups across Europe, addressing health inequalities.
Scope:
Unsustainable and unhealthy diets, with an increased demand for livestock products and calorie-dense and nutrient-poor foods that are often highly processed (high in calories, sugars, sodium/salt, saturated fat and alcohol, and low in wholegrains, fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds), are the leading NCD risk factor and a driver of high obesity rates. In Europe, at present, more than half of the adult population is overweight or obese, and children and population groups of lower socio-economic status are the most severely affected. NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes are responsible for the deaths of 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally[1]. NCDs have a negative impact on both lives and health budgets but are largely preventable through effective interventions that tackle shared risk factors (such as unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol abuse).
The complexity of the interactions between diet and human health requires multi-level engagement and inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to improve public health and reduce Europe’s major health and economic burden. The development of new societally acceptable approaches/strategies/tools for healthy and sustainable diets that reduce diet-related NCDs requires a systemic approach involving a wide diversity of actors and sectors at different levels (from local to international). These include policy makers and public authorities, health care providers, schools and higher education establishments, food producers and processors, retailers, hospitality and food services (e.g. restaurants, canteens), researchers, non-governmental consumer and patient organisations, science brokers and private individuals.
Proposals should consider a range of diet-related NCDs, geographic, socio-economic, behavioural and cultural factors. The gender dimension of the research is particularly important for this topic. Data collected and integrated by the private and public sectors should be broken down by gender and by socio-economic groups.
Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects. Selected projects under this topic (and under the HORIZON-HLTH-2022-STAYHLTH-01-05-two-stage topic: Prevention of obesity throughout the life course) are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate, possibly in the form of project clustering, workshops, etc. Proposals are expected to show support for common coordination and dissemination activities. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover such activities.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Mapping and monitoring of the diet-related NCD situation (e.g. cardiovascular and heart diseases, obesity, diabetes, cancer and allergies) at the EU level, based on a literature review to better understand the relationship between lifestyle (including diet, nutrition and alcohol, physical activity), physiological and genetic parameters including the human microbiome, gender and sex, geographical placement (national/regional/neighbourhood and rural/urban zone), socio-economic, cultural and environmental (with particular reference to the human exposome) factors, biological parameters (including genomics and microbiomes), and the risk of NCDs.
Development of standardised methods for collecting (missing) data, using existing data/studies/cohorts and increasing the use of big data and artificial intelligence to elucidate the complex interactions between diet and human health.
Development of advanced and easy-to-use biomarkers of risk/response for NCDs, including non-invasive and microbiome-based ones.
Assessment and monitoring of the impact of existing measures/interventions/policies in the EU on reducing NCDs.
Investigating and generating a strong evidence base for the key physiological processes involved in the development of NCDs and how they may be affected by nutrition (from specific nutrient, dietary components to foods and dietary patterns) and other factors (e.g. geographical, biological, socio-economic, cultural, environmental, educational), taking into account individual genotype-phenotype status.
Development of a strong evidence base on the risks of unhealthy diet and unhealthy food (high in calories, sugars, sodium/salt, saturated fat and alcohol, low in wholegrains, fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, and often highly processed) within the development of NCDs versus healthy food/products.
Identifying high risk/vulnerable populations across Europe, better understanding their predisposition to diet-related diseases, and designing specific hypothesis-driven research and well-controlled intervention studies with very strict conditions to reduce dietary and health inequalities in different countries, regions, rural and urban areas.
Developing more targeted recommendations for effective and cost-efficient integrated policies (such as social, fiscal, regulatory, marketing) in the short-, medium- and long term. These are to support Member States and associated countries and policy makers in designing effective and cost-efficient policies that focus on prevention and promote healthy diets to reduce diet-related NCDs, taking into account environmental, gender, social and economic sustainability aspects.
Undertaking risk/benefit cost analyses for the different options proposed to better predict and understand effective and long-term impacts and facilitate informed policy decisions and societal debate.
The required multi-actor approach (see the eligibility conditions) must be implemented by involving a wide diversity of food system actors and conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research.

In line with the farm to fork strategy, for a transition to fair, healthy and resilient livestock production systems, including the reduction of anti-microbial usage, a successful proposal will support research and innovation (R&I) to help research funders, policy makers and business operators in decreasing the burden of infectious animal diseases, thus contributing to sustainable agriculture and to public health at global level. Considering the transboundary nature of infectious animal diseases and relate issues such as anti-microbial resistance, providing support to the work of the STAR-IDAZ International Research Consortium (IRC) will facilitate international coordination of research in these domains. Such a support will enhance and leverage capacity to prevent and control diseases not only globally, but also in the EU and associated countries, to reduce the risk to human health arising from infectious animal diseases and anti-microbial resistance, and to contribute to global food security.
At EU level, this will contribute to supporting the objectives of the ‘farm to fork’ strategy for a transition to fair, healthy and resilient European livestock production systems, including the reduction of anti-microbial usage while improving the efficiency and competitiveness of livestock production,
Project results are expected to contribute to all following outcomes:
ensuring public access to and active dissemination of pertinent information on research activities, needs, and research outputs on priority infectious animal diseases, including zoonoses, and related issues; and
fostering the delivery of new or improved prevention, control and surveillance tools or strategies.
Scope:
Infectious animal diseases and related issues can cause serious social, economic and environmental damage and in a number of cases threaten human health (zoonoses, anti-microbial resistance). These diseases do not respect borders and can often spread quickly through out the globe. These global threats, the diversity of pathogens and livestock species and the scarce resources available for animal health research make the case for international cooperation on priority diseases and issues, in order to expedite the development of better prevention and control methods, ensure the sustainability of livestock industries and protect human health and the environment. This initiative should consolidate and deepen international research cooperation in the area of infectious animal diseases and related issues such as anti-microbial resistance. It should support the activities of the STAR-IDAZ International Research Consortium (Star-IDAZ IRC), aiming to strengthen the global network of research programme owners and funding organisations in order to achieve specific targets relating to the prevention and control of priority infectious animal diseases, including zoonoses, and related issues such as anti-microbial resistance and new emerging threats. The action should (i) facilitate the work of the Executive and Scientific Committee and the working groups, (ii) organise research gap analyses as appropriate, (iii) maintain the necessary tools and other work resources, (iv) disseminate pertinent information and results to stakeholders and users, (v) organise interaction with relevant projects and initiatives, and (vi) organise activities to leverage resources and enlarge the network as appropriate.

A successful proposal will contribute to the EU’s goal of leading just digital, economic and ecological transitions that will leave no one behind, supporting in particular European Green Deal priorities such as the biodiversity strategy for 2030. R&I will contribute to develop rural, coastal and urban areas in a sustainable, balanced and inclusive manner thanks to the deployment of nature-based solutions (NBS)[1] and to a better understanding of the environmental, socio-economic, behavioural and cultural drivers of change. R&I will also further support the empowerment of communities to deploy NBS to adapt to climate change and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience, well-being and positive long-term prospects, such as jobs for all (including for women, young people and vulnerable groups).
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced contribution of nature-based solutions (NBS) to social and economic targets, especially in vulnerable communities and notably regarding the transformative change needed to address the biodiversity and climate crises.
New NBS governance models and co-creation approaches and tools, as well as NBS design and technologies that enhance social benefits while providing ecological and economic benefits.
NBS are better suited to respond to different socio-political contexts and have higher replicability in the diverse environmental, economic and social conditions across Europe.
Scope:
Nature-based solutions (NBS) are already being delivered with increasing evidence on their effectiveness, but implementation issues persist, hindering NBS uptake and upscale. There is a need to move beyond seeing the implementation challenge as primarily a technical issue, to develop our understanding of the economic, social, political, moral and cultural dimensions of designing and implementing NBS[2].
Most of the available approaches seem inadequate to fully take into consideration synergies and trade-offs among different actions, notably in what concerns the social and cultural benefits of NBS. They often also fail to understand the social, political and institutional contexts and the material and discursive elements that shape NBS implementation. This, in turn, affects the long-term success of NBS, notably in contributing to the transformative change needed to address the biodiversity and climate crises. This understanding is particularly crucial when implementing NBS to support vulnerable communities and regions to cope with transformative change in old-industrialised, low-income, outermost or disaster-hit areas. NBS can also contribute to addressing inequities and well-being in communities and regions who need it most, especially in terms of the post-COVID19 recovery. Additionally, our understanding of how diverse actors – who may operate at different scales and through multiple networks – are engaged in the development and implementation of NBS is still limited, especially when the deployment of NBS implies collaboration across different regions, administrative areas or simply different types of land owners.
The successful proposals should:
Gain a wider understanding of the role of actors involved in NBS, considering: a) particular groups of actors that have been under-researched (e.g. land holders such as churches, charitable organizations, educational establishments, utilities, etc.); b) sectors of the economy (e.g. agriculture, forestry, tourism, finance, etc.) and c) landscapes (e.g. coastal areas, river catchments, wetlands, etc.);
Investigate how different NBS designs and governance can contribute to environmental justice, prevent environmental racism and gentrification, insure the inclusion and active participation of women, youth, minority groups, immigrant communities, etc.;
Develop innovative governance models: a) exploring different forms of engagement, inclusion and stewardship; b) enabling the breaking of silos in public administration and between different administrative domains; and c) tackling other legal, management and administrative issues;
Propose ways in which NBS governance and design can contribute to transformative change and to a just transition in support of the Sustainable Development Goals;
Understand and propose solutions to functional conflicts in land-use for better and more integration between NBS, land-use planning and other (possibly conflicting) sectors, their policies and planning processes;
Explore governance techniques (e.g. standards, certification, incentives, subsidies, etc.) that develop private and voluntary governance alongside formal regulatory and planning powers, with a view to mainstreaming NBS in the public and private sectors.
Identify the possibilities for, and limits to, the full co-creation approach in NBS (including co-design, co-implementation, co-maintenance and co-monitoring), their underlying governance arrangements and instruments;
Provide approaches based on citizen science, big data or artificial intelligence tools to better communicate the science of NBS and promote citizen engagement in the co-creation, co-implementation and co-monitoring of NBS;
Understand how the meanings and values attached to nature in urban, rural, coastal, periurban or post-industrial areas affect the long-term success of NBS. To this end, investigate what counts as nature, what is valued and why this varies amongst individuals and communities as well as how this can be taken into account in the development of NBS.
Investigate the impact of citizens’ perceptions and expectations towards NBS on management decisions and delivery of ecosystem services, while considering also the role of NBSs in generating new kinds of connections and values for nature and with what consequences.
Proposals should address all of the above points.
Proposals should bring together from the start multiple types of scientific expertise in both natural sciences and social sciences and humanities (e.g. geography, sociology, political ecology, behavioural sciences, anthropology, philosophy, etc). In particular, this topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
Projects should seek to contribute to the New European Bauhaus initiative by supporting the green and digital transitions in communities’ living environments through merging sustainability, inclusiveness and quality of experience. Small-scale pilots could be envisaged to explore NBS which are innovative either in their functional scope, socio-economic reach, integrative approaches or application in new settings.
Applicants should create synergies with projects under the same topic and other relevant ongoing or up-coming projects, notably the Horizon 2020 NBS project portfolio and its task forces; HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-05: The economics of nature-based solutions: cost-benefit analysis, market development and funding; HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-06: Nature-based solutions, prevention and reduction of risks and the insurance sector; HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-03: Network for nature: multi-stakeholder dialogue platform to promote nature-based solutions; HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-02-02-two-stage: Developing nature-based therapy for health and well-being; HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-06: Inside and outside: educational innovation with nature-based solutions. To this end, proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, foresee joint activities and joint deliverables.
Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information and project outputs will be accessible through the Oppla portal (the EU repository for NBS)[3].
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with the Latin American and Caribbean region and the USA.

In line with the farm to fork strategy, the successful proposal will support integrated pest management practices facilitating the progress towards the ambitious target of reduced use of plant protection products while supporting the agricultural / forestry sectors to remain productive and contribute to sustainable and biodiversity friendly agriculture and/or forest health.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Identify opportunities and barriers to increase the uptake of integrated pest management and low-pesticide-input pest management across the diversity of EU and Associated Countries farming systems;
Increase the capacity to understand the impact of current pesticide use practices and proposed alternatives on the agricultural sector;
Develop a thorough understanding of farmers’ decision-making, governance aspects and consumption patterns behind integrated pest management and low pesticide use practices;
Support the design of relevant related policies to achieve the targets of the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies;
Strengthened transdisciplinary research and integrated scientific support for relevant EU policies and priorities (Sustainable Use Directive[1], common agricultural policy (CAP), Green Deal objectives, European pillar of social rights, etc.).
Scope:
Research has shown that well-designed integrated pest management programmes can control pests in an ecologically friendly manner; however, farming today relies on chemical treatments to ensure farm profits and yield. A better understanding of the social, economic and policy factors that can hinder or promote the uptake as well as evidence of the economic performance of integrated pest management/ low pesticide practices are needed to identify measures that can enhance its adoption and encourage the involvement of all relevant actors across the value chain. Project funded under this topic should ensure synergies and collaboration with other relevant ongoing Horizon 2020 projects.
Proposals should:
Improve understanding of the reasons for the limited uptake of reduced pesticide use/integrated pest management practices and/or shift towards low-risk pesticides and bio-control agents and practices. This should include a deeper analysis of the evolution since the whole agricultural sector may be impacted by a reduction of pesticide use.
Improve understanding of the impact (including direct and indirect effects) of current pesticide use practices and proposed alternatives at various scales, from fields to landscape and rural areas.
Analyse the sociological and economic drivers and unintended consequences, such as the switching of crops and/or pesticides when a plant protection product becomes unavailable.
Analyse the consequences of the ongoing development of resistances to the use of pesticides (both in qualitative and quantitative terms), on productivity, on the economic performance of farms, on natural habitats and biodiversity and the environment.
Analyse the competitiveness of goods produced using chemical pesticide-free/low-pesticide agriculture.
Proposals should cover a wide range of farm typologies, sectors and systems representative of the diversity of farming in the EU and Associated Countries, including both conventional and organic. Proposals must implement the “multi-actor approach” including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as research, social partners, plant health services and farmers/foresters are brought together.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will consist of the use of a farm-level modelling tool to contribute to the assessment of the socio-economic impacts of alternative pesticide use practices, as well as to the evaluation of different policy scenarios to incentivise the uptake of alternative pesticide strategies. Additionally, the JRC could contribute to the analysis of possible survey data dealing with socio-economic impacts of current and alternative pesticide use practices.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as with the EU's climate objectives for 2030 and 2050, the EU’s “Comprehensive Strategy with Africa” calls on the EU to “partner with Africa to maximise the benefits of the green transition and minimise threats to the environment”. In support of this strategy, the EU and the African Union are implementing a ten-year roadmap (2016-2026) on research and innovation in food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture to which the successful proposal will contribute. It will also contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Urban areas contribute significantly to global food-system related emissions and food waste. Urban growth often happens at the expense of natural resources. Urban areas are increasingly affected by the double burden of malnutrition: high prevalence of undernourishment and undernutrition and increasing obesity and the spread of non communicable diseases.
A successful proposal will build on initiatives like the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact (MUFPP), on the FAO urban food agenda and upon the recommendations of the Task Force Rural Africa report. It will address big, intermediate and small cities and towns. It will address the fact that poorly planned urban food systems lack opportunities to link rural and urban food producers, markets and consumers, and limit the access of vulnerable groups to safe and healthy nutrition.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all or some of following expected outcomes:
A shift to food security and improved nutrition in five African cities (could encompass rural urban centres and cities) through a shift to healthy and affordable diets that reduces the pressure of food production on land and water use and reduces the climate footprint of downstream activities from farm to fork.
Reducing the food-system-related environmental footprint, improving circularity (e.g. food and packaging waste), and providing citizens with new, sustainable and healthy products.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Understanding: promoting multi-stakeholder collaborations in assessing data on food challenges (including harmful marketing and advertising and unequal access to healthy food for the urban poor), and identifying opportunities and indicators in developing urban food policies.
Engaging: mobilising a wide diversity of food system actors (from farm to fork, the public and private sector, and society, organic and conventional); in particular higher education institutions and research centres to work with local actors in support of evidence-based food policy development and to help provide local solutions to integrated food system challenges.
Mutual learning: reinforcing or creating new networks of African cities and towns to share good practices and learn from and support each other. This implies also involving cities (in Africa, Europe or elsewhere) with well-developed food policies to provide guidance and lessons learned, as well as new forms of collaboration/twinning.
Innovation: proposals should envisage a space for mentoring and accelerating innovative business concepts, including social innovation and upscaling in view of African or European food business entrepreneurs with special consideration of women and the diaspora using cascading funding opportunities. Proposals may involve financial support to third parties e.g. to academic researchers, start-ups, SMEs and other multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate developed assessment approaches or collect or prepare data sets or provide other contributions to achieve the project objectives. A maximum of EUR 60 000 per third party may be granted. Conditions for third parties support are set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support will be granted. A maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.
Where relevant, creating links to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the global Earth observation system of systems (GEOSS).
Exploring how the food environment can become crisis-proof (whether something can be learnt from or has changed with the COVID-19 crisis) and how to create resilient local, regional food systems with border regimes, which do not disrupt supply chains.
Governance: developing and evaluating innovative multi-actor urban food systems governance processes and capacities for science-backed integrated policy making and implementation actions that deliver on the international collaboration dimension of the farm to fork strategy objectives and Food 2030 co-benefits for health, environment, climate, circularity and inclusion, while minimizing trade-offs.
EU-AU partnership: proposals should have a clear plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic and similar projects funded under the EU-AU HLPD-FNSSA priority from different funding sources including Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, ERA-Nets, African Union research grants, DeSIRA or PRIMA. They should contribute to the work of the FNSSA-working group (WG) by linking to the LEAP4FNSSA project supporting the FNSSA-WG secretariat. They should participate in joint activities, workshops and as common communication and dissemination activities and show potential for upscaling. Applicants should plan the necessaryfunding to cover these activities.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of rural areas, supporting the implementation of the EU farm to fork strategy[1], the European pillar of social rights[2] and the long-term vision for rural areas[3]. It will do so by increasing the understanding of the social and behavioural drivers of change, especially in relation with social inclusion, labour, health and safety aspects, and by favouring the deployment of innovations that improve labour conditions, health and safety in farming, equipping the sector with smarter and innovative solutions that increase opportunities for most vulnerable groups, improve attractiveness of farm work and reduce the feeling of being left behind. Improved knowledge leading to more supportive policy frameworks alongside practical innovations will empower people and businesses to act for change and get prepared to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, adapt to climate change, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience, good health and positive long-term prospects, including jobs, for all including women, young people and vulnerable groups.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
enhanced understanding and awareness by policy makers, farmers organisations, trade unions and health authorities of farmers’ and farm workers’ health and safety, and on the implications of the perceptions of their work on the future of the sector and hence on long-term food security;
improved policy and governance frameworks favouring safer and more inclusive working environments for farmers and farm workers;
wider use of corporate social responsibility innovations by farm businesses; and
improved health, safety and labour conditions in farming thanks to better performing European and national policy and legal frameworks and innovative bottom-up initiatives.
Scope:
Proposals should analyse health and safety at work issues in the farming sector with a specific focus on working conditions (and how they will evolve with digital transitions, climate change, health risks, regulatory developments on chemicals, farmers mental health, injuries, etc.) and labour conditions (seasonal patterns, working time, income and work outside legal contracts, including mobile EU and non-EU workers) also in relation to the perceived attractiveness of farming or working in farming as a job. They should analyse work risks and the vulnerability of farm workers of different genders and ages. They should engage with current and potential future farmers and farm workers on their perception of work in farming and their perspectives and plans for the future, including farm inheritance/take over, seeking to understand the attractiveness of the job (e.g. in relation to wages, stability, seasonality etc.). They should assess the impact of the type of labour force involved (family, local, external) on society and on the farm (including from the workers’ perspectives) and the consequences in case of external shocks such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.
Proposals should explore the potential of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and social economy and entrepreneurship to improve the situation of farm workers, including business models that reward improved working conditions through premium prices or other forms of reward, including for non-productive functions such as social inclusion, empowerment and care (non-EU good practices could be considered). They should analyse consumers’ willingness to pay for more ethical working conditions and enabling conditions for market development in this arena. To this end, they should support social innovation[4], social entrepreneurship or corporate social responsibility pilots in a limited number of localities to serve as role models or positive examples to learn from and be scaled-up.
They should explore the policy implications of the outcomes (including regulation and control); benchmark policy design and delivery and make recommendations for improved policy frameworks at the right level of governance considering the various competencies involved (EU, national, regional etc.). Finally, they should develop training and education actions to raise farmers, farm workers, trade unions and farmers organisations awareness of health-protecting innovations that can be scaled up.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach, bringing together multiple science fields, in particular the social sciences and humanities (SSH) (e.g. sociology, behavioural sciences, psychology etc.), actors with complementary knowledge of health, employment, farm contracts, taxation etc., farmers and farmer organisations or trade unions and support groups for farmers facing difficulties. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines. Proposals should cover a representative variety of countries and sectors at least in the EU, covering in particular countries and sectors in which intra-EU and non-EU mobile workers are a significant part of the sector’s labour force. Attention should be paid to gender and age disparities in the cases analysed and pilots supported. For gender-related issues, the project may engage in collaboration with projects funded under HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-01: Boosting women-led innovation in farming and rural areas.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the ‘farm to fork’ strategy for a transition to fair, healthy and resilient livestock production systems, including the reduction of anti-microbial usage, a successful proposal will support research and innovation (R&I) in helping policy makers and economic operators to prevent and control infectious animal diseases, thus contributing to sustainable agriculture and to public health.
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
improving the capacity of policy makers, members of the veterinary profession, business operators and other relevant actors to prioritise and implement biosecurity measures in different production systems on farms and other places where animals are handled;
gaining a better understanding of the costs and efficiency of certain biosecurity measures.
Scope:
Biosecurity refers to a set of management and physical measures designed to reduce the risk of introduction, establishment and spread of diseases, infections or infestations to, from and within a population[1]. Biosecurity can prevent or minimise the risk of transmission of infectious diseases not only to animals, but also people (zoonoses), and contributes to the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Where no vaccine is available nor authorised, like for African swine fever or other new and emerging diseases, the control of infectious diseases relies heavily on biosecurity and no disease prevention, eradication or control programme can work without it. Proposed projects should address biosecurity at primary production, at least on farms and where animals are handled, but may also address relevant sectors like the feed industry. Effective biosecurity requires constant attention by those implementing it. Biosecurity can more easily be performed in enclosed facilities, like for indoor livestock farming, than in outdoor production, which may facilitate direct or indirect contacts with wildlife and subsequent transmission of a pathogenic infectious agent to livestock, although risks from outdoor farming may not always be higher than indoor. General principles of external and internal biosecurity are known, not least at farm level, but may not be equally applicable to all farms, production systems and species and protect equally well against all relevant diseases. The costs and efficiency of different measures are not always known, and guidelines are not common yet.
The proposals should:
address different terrestrial animal species and production systems, and different situations where livestock are handled;
address the main diseases or groups of diseases against which biosecurity measures are effective, taking into account epidemiology of the diseases and related risks (e.g. wildlife);
collect and disseminate best practices, and develop guidelines where appropriate;
develop validated applicable methods or refine tools to assess biosecurity measures on farms or other places where livestock is handled;
select certain measures, evaluate their efficiency, where appropriate by testing, and estimate their cost.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector, the veterinary profession, advisory services and other relevant actors.

In line with the European Green Deal priorities, and in particular the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as with the EU's climate objectives, the successful proposals should support prevention and reduction of food losses and waste. They should therefore contribute to creating sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems that deliver co-benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food consumption, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Projects results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Successful implementation of the harmonisation of food waste measurement across Europe, supported by the development of new tools across the food system on land and at sea, from farm to fork, producing reliable and comparable data on food and waste (area A);
With respect to food losses at the primary production stage:
robust measurement of the magnitude of food losses at the primary production stage (i.e., agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture) at Member States and the EU levels for various commodities and at aggregated level, thereby contributing to the prevention and reduction of such losses (area B);
better understanding of the drivers (root causes) of food losses at the primary production stage and identification of ways for policymakers and primary producers to prevent and reduce them (area B).
Well-informed and more effective policy and business strategies for preventing and reducing food losses and waste across the food system on land and at sea, from farm to fork (area A and B).
Scope:
Each year, a substantial amount of food is lost or wasted all along the food value chain, from primary production to final consumption. Food losses and waste have negative impacts on the society, the environment and the economy. They contribute to food insecurity and hinder nutrition, generate GHG emissions and create pressure on land and water, including through habitat degradation and biodiversity loss, and are responsible for great economic losses. Such negative impacts are exacerbated in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, when additional food losses and wastes are generated by disruptions in food supply chains.
Preventing and reducing the amount of food intended for human consumption that is eventually lost or wasted is a complex challenge. The robust and reliable measurement and monitoring of food losses and waste is key to tracking progress made over time and informing the development and implementation of effective strategies and actions.
The recent adoption of the EU Commission Decision (EU) 2019/1597 set a common method and minimum quality requirements for the uniform measurement of levels of food waste at the national level. However, since thoroughly assessing food losses at the primary production stage is difficult, time-consuming and costly, the common EU method excludes measurement of food losses at this stage. In addition to this lack of information about the levels of food losses at the primary production stage, there is also insufficient understanding of the root causes and drivers behind these losses, and this is key to developing effective strategies for preventing and reducing them.
Proposals responding to this topic should address one of the two complementary areas:
Develop cost-efficient food waste-relevant data collection, integration and analyses based on a large number of varied sources (e.g. households, food services, other small business), as well as on food discarded through wastewater, in order to improve the mapping of current food waste profiles at European and national level. To this end, proposals should speed up the innovation process and develop and test new technologies and tools along the food systems – from farm to fork, on land and at sea.
Develop and validate new tools and methods to measure and estimate food losses at the primary production stage, including storage of products originating from agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture. These new tools and methods should be applied and food losses at primary production stage measured across a large enough sample of diverse farms/production systems and value chains (including organic and agroecological), for a wide range of the most important commodities produced in the EU, across several years and in all Member States. This should generate robust measurement/estimation of food losses at the primary production stage for different commodities, at the Member State and EU levels, and at an aggregated level. Where relevant, measurements from Earth observation platforms may be used. To minimise data collection bias, each Member State should create a pool of trained researchers who are able to use the method and directly measure the food losses at the primary production stage. In addition to measurement, the direct and indirect drivers and root causes of food losses at primary production stage should be thoroughly investigated. Particular attention should be paid to the identification of market driven food losses at the primary production stage, to assess the potential for a reduction strategy based on marked demand shifts. Generated insights should also allow for identification of possible ways to prevent and reduce food losses at the primary production stage.
Proposals should provide recommendations for policymakers and best practice guidelines / business strategies for researchers and relevant operators across the various diverse terrestrial and aquatic food value chains.
Proposals should build on the work done by the Commission’s Joint Research Centre in support of the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste and be aligned with the environmental footprint method developed by the Commission. The possible participation of the JRC in the project would consist of gathering data collected in the projects into a consistent framework for modelling food losses and waste, integrating life cycle assessment considerations in the projects, in particular in the assessment of food losses and waste prevention intervention and food innovation, helping translating results into policy relevant outputs.
Proposals should deliver on the food waste reduction and prevention targets relevant to the farm to fork strategy, across the food systems. In addition, in area A, they should also explain how they will deliver co-benefits on the four Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, and innovation and empowerment of communities.
In area A, the required multi-actor approach must be implemented by conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide diversity of food system actors, with special attention paid to consumers and civil society organisations.
Proposals are encouraged to build on past or ongoing EU-funded research and work together with relevant initiatives including the European Commission Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste. They should set out a clear plan on how they will work with other proposals selected under this and any other relevant topics, e.g. by participating in joint activities and workshops, or by running common communication and dissemination activities.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines. Proposals should take into account and address inequalities, whether they be due to gender, race or other social categories.

","23 February 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, and the EU’s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I to promote the production, provision and consumption of alternative sources of proteins as well as dietary shifts towards sustainable healthy nutrition. This will contribute to transforming food systems so that they can deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shifts, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
The EU’s farm to fork strategy states that: “European diets are not in line with national dietary recommendations, and the ‘food environment’ does not ensure that the healthy option is always the easiest one”.
The food environment, which makes the link between food supply and diets, is one of the determinants of consumer choices and food production. As such, food environments are essential to enabling a dietary shift towards less livestock-based and less highly processed food (e.g., more fresh and minimally processed fruit and vegetables, plant-based and aquatic food to tackle the over-consumption of meat and dairy). Much more R&I is needed on food environments to ensure that environmental sustainability and health objectives can be achieved.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of food environments to ensure that people, including the most vulnerable groups, have choices in terms of alternative proteins (e.g. plant-based, microbe-based, ocean-based (i.e. fish, algae, invertebrates), fungus-based, insect-based), to foster a dietary shift (accessibility and availability).
Ensuring an overall improvement in public health as a result of this shift, with a shift towards healthy, sustainable and diversified dietary patterns in line with national dietary advice.
Reducing the environmental burden of European diets, including but not limited to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution and impact on ecosystems, improving circularity (e.g. food waste and by-products), providing new, sustainable and healthy products made of alternative sources of proteins to consumers.
Scope:
According to studies carried out by Milford et al. (2019)[1] and Castellani et al. (2017)[2], consumer choices depend on the food environment that ensures the availability of and access to food. The behavioural sciences suggest that, to achieve a meaningful dietary shift, a choice architecture should be designed to promote healthy and sustainable food preferences.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Empowering the ‘middle part’ of the food system, including for example industry, processors, retailers, food services, cooks and caterers to shape the food environment toward sustainability EU-wide, through the provision of a diverse diet based on alternative protein sources, including through training/skills-building among different actors in order to produce and provide alternative protein food.
Working on diversifying the offering, particularly in terms of alternative protein sources, and ensuring easier access to and affordability of sustainable and healthy (as defined in national dietary recommendations) foods and diets everywhere (urban, peri-urban and rural areas) for everybody (including the most vulnerable).
Developing industry-ready processes to sustainably produce food based on alternative proteins whose sensory characteristics (e.g. colour, taste, structure) and nutritional value will be accepted by consumers.
Developing a typology of food environments across Europe and identifying the enabling factors for positive transformative change to healthy sustainable diets.
Assessing the tools and instruments (e.g. policy measures, incentives, existing and new promotion and marketing approaches, pricing policies) necessary to increase and vary the provision of alternative protein foods, which would lead to overall healthy and sustainable dietary patterns in line with national recommendations.
Taking into account several key elements for the provision of alternative protein sources, e.g. shelf life, food handling, affordability (including externalities in prices of unhealthy and unsustainable diets), trade-offs between various food provision routes, developing new varieties of protein sources and rediscovering/valorising old varieties, traceability, and preserving flavour and natural resources (this would therefore be linked to the outcome of projects funded under the HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-12 topic: Filling knowledge gaps on the nutritional, safety, allergenicity and environmental assessment of alternative proteins and dietary shift). Gender aspects could also be considered.
Exploring how the food environment can become ‘crisis-proof’ (whether something can be learnt from or has changed with the COVID-19 pandemic): creating resilient local, regional or European food systems that provide food and nutrition security for Europeans in a way that protects against future disruptions in supply chains. One way of doing this is by diversifying diets and providing people with alternative sources of protein.
Clearly explain how the proposal will deliver co-benefits to each of the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g. meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Implementing the required multi-actor approach (see the eligibility conditions) by involving a wide diversity of food system actors and conducting trans-disciplinary research. Proposals should also promote international cooperation. Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects (especially the four projects funded under the LC-SFS-17-2019 topic: Alternative proteins for food and feed). Projects should have a clear plan on how they will work with other projects selected under this topic (if funding of more than one project is possible). They should participate in joint activities, workshops, focus groups or social labs, as well as organise common communication and dissemination activities and show potential for upscaling. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.

In line with the European Green Deal objectives, the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, the EU bioeconomy strategy and blue growth strategy, the successful proposal will support freshwater aquaculture products/processes and/or environmental services sustaining the health of freshwater ecosystems and their bioeconomy sectors.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improvement of the environmental footprint and resource efficiency of freshwater aquaculture and stimulation of its diversification and growth in the framework of an integrated freshwater bioeconomy strategy.
Preservation of freshwater biodiversity by reducing the freshwater aquaculture impacts (e.g. with appropriate spatial planning) and assessment of its potential for biotechnological applications
Stimulation of sustainable economic growth and jobs creation in the freshwater bioeconomy sector for people living in lakeside and riverside areas in Europe.
Improvement of the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.
Scope:
Freshwater systems host an immense biodiversity and support a multitude of activities providing livelihoods to inland populations. Lakes, ponds and rivers require a transition to more sustainable and environment-friendly productive ecosystems through optimal water management and planning, mutually benefiting the different ecosystem services by developing economic activities in rural areas, maintaining the biodiversity, and increasing resilience to climate change and water crises.
Aquaculture, in particular integrated multi-trophic or recirculating aquaculture systems, can be key for the development of lakeside and riverside areas as it can be combined with other bio-based activities, such as farming, livestock and the use of hitherto unused naturally produced biomass. Addressing environmental concerns, such as the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive, are essential for sustainable growth of freshwater aquaculture. Preserving biodiversity, including health and biosecurity issues, is also key for potential biotechnological applications that should also be explored under this topic.
The Strategic Working Group on Fisheries and Aquaculture (SCAR-Fish) of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) highlighted in a recent study[1] several issues that urgently need to be explored by research and addressed by innovation, such as climate change-related issues and issues of profitability. Research in this topic should consider the priorities of the SCAR-Fish study.
Strong and active involvement of stakeholders and end-users, including industry and NGOs, in a co-creation approach, is key for the success of the projects that will be selected.
International co-operation with partners from non-associated third countries is strongly encouraged as a win-win scenario, while contributing to the European competitiveness and resilience.
Where relevant, proposals may seek synergies and capitalise on the results of projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, its continuation European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams

The development of reliable and practical tools to ensure the safe and sustainable use of nanomaterials has not kept pace with the rapid commercialization of nanotechnology-enabled products. The dynamic nature of many nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices is recognized as a major challenge for their detection, quantification and characterization. Consequently, there is an urgent need to establish appropriate methods for cost-efficient assessment and prediction of the health and environmental effects of nanomaterials, providing better decision criteria, based on quantitative rather than qualitative information and taking into account the full life cycle of a material. Proposal results are expected to contribute to several of the following expected outcomes:
Develop high-resolution imaging methods for quantification and characterization of nanomaterials (e.g. nanoplastics) in complex matrices and determinations of their transformations in such environments.
Increase availability of validated protocols to advance both nanosafety studies and material characterization.
Ensure appropriate control experiments and more realistic in vitro models to address current gaps in nanotoxicology.
Deliver reliable data and improved data reporting guidelines, supported by computational modelling, in order to allow the development of grouping and read across methods. Make use of open access database and using standards for data documentation (e.g. CHADA).
Develop harmonized standardized test methods that can be used in a regulatory framework including test hazard assessment, biodegradability and sustainability for advanced nanomaterials.
Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of materials and product development by reducing costs and time for product design, time-to-market and regulatory compliance
Scope:
Develop advanced characterization tools and methods for nanomaterials industry to enhance the design and development stages of advanced materials and products contributing to less waste and emissions while improving process quality in line with Life Cycle Assessment framework;
Develop new in vitro models and tests to assess nanotoxicology;
Include use cases to validate and demonstrate the approach(es) in industrial settings and involve comprehensive analysis and measurement of process and handling release scenarios and exposure measurements;
Propose the validated methods to standardization bodies such as ISO or OECD for development of standards, test guidance or a guidance document;
Demonstrate connectivity with H2020 nanosafety projects and leverage the extensive experience from relevant initiatives. Cooperation with EU funded projects under Industry Commons and other similar initiatives for interoperability and data documentation should be addressed;

Objectives:
The ERC Proof of Concept Grants aim to maximise the value of the excellent research that the ERC funds, by funding further work (i.e. activities which were not scheduled to be funded by the original ERC frontier research grant) to verify the innovation potential of ideas arising from ERC funded projects. Proof of Concept Grants are therefore on offer only to Principal Investigators whose proposals draw substantially on their ERC funded research.
Scope:
Size of ERC Proof of Concept Grants:
The financial contribution will be awarded as a lump sum of EUR 150 000 for a period of 18 months. The ERC expects that normally proof of concept projects should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, projects will be signed for 18 months. Given this initial flexibility, extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.
The lump sum will cover the beneficiaries' direct and indirect eligible costs for the project: if the project is implemented properly the amounts will be paid regardless of the costs actually incurred. The lump sum has been designed to cover the beneficiaries’ personnel costs, subcontracting, purchase costs, other cost categories and indirect costs.
Profile of the ERC Proof of Concept Eligible Principal Investigator:
All Principal Investigators in an ERC frontier research project, that is either ongoing or has ended less than 12 months before 1 January 2022, are eligible to participate and apply for an ERC Proof of Concept Grant.

","28 October 2021
","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The partnership is expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and Digital Europe priorities, the successful proposal will contribute to the sustainability and resilience of the blue economy by supporting the establishment of innovative governance models. It will also contribute to strengthening the EU and international science-policy interfaces in marine- and maritime-related domains as well as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) by supporting the further deployment and exploitation of Environmental Observation data and products and of digital and data technologies.
EU and national multi-level cooperation and alignment across and within regional seas of research and innovation programmes, priorities and investments are enhanced, based on established strategic research and innovation agendas and related cooperation activities, including international agreements and outreach; as well as cooperation with other Horizon Europe initiatives, European partnerships and missions.
Europe’s role in ocean science, research, social and technological developments, innovation and productivity in the marine domain is clearly strengthened by 2030 and transformative governance enables the advances of the role of Europe in business, finance and social developments in the marine/maritime domain.
By 2030, Europe has contributed significantly and in a measurable way to the climate neutrality of the blue economy, the European Green Deal objectives and its different strategies.
The science-based implementation of EU marine-related legislation, regulations and objectives is supported, as well as the advanced sustainability of activities, practices and existing and new products and services of the blue economy value chains throughout European regional seas and the Atlantic.
Transformative change is promoted and enabled through actionable science and sustainable, fair and just solutions for the blue economy and for communities, involving a participatory and multi-stakeholder approach.
The deployment of digital, nature-based and social innovations as well as community-led and purpose-driven technology for the blue economy is supported.
Ocean literacy in the EU and beyond is increased.
Sustained ocean and coastal observations and availability of FAIR data for environmental, climate and blue economy purposes are substantially increased.
Global cooperation with key partners bordering the different EU sea basins is strengthened.
Scope:
Europe’s seas and ocean do not stop at national borders, nor do the challenges they face. Many of the issues are common throughout European seas and the Atlantic, even globally. A major effort is needed to increase the development of ocean science, research, technological developments and innovation, both to protect the ocean and to increase the resilience of its ecosystems and to ensure a strong sustainable blue economy and science-based design of marine spatial planning, involving all stakeholders. No nation can face this on its own and undertake the investments in research, technology and innovation that are needed to steer new business, governance and social developments[1].
Many of the identified research priorities and activities of the EU and individual countries are similar and, therefore, require alignment over all European seas and ocean. Existing and new funding streams from national, public and private sources will need to be pooled, together with EU funding, in order to maximise efforts and achieve efficiency gains. To address these issues, sea basin-specific Research and Innovation Agendas (RIAs) have been developed for the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, and the Black Sea[2]. An impact-driven and coherent approach needs to be designed to combine all of these research and innovation agendas, in order to structure the European landscape, so that common issues can be addressed jointly, and national marine strategies are developed in a consistent way.
The partnership should catalyse the transformation of Europe’s blue economy towards climate neutral status by 2050. By aligning national, regional and EU R&I priorities and bringing together science, industry, governance and society, it should deliver knowledge and solutions to make the blue economy sustainable. Responding to national and EU policy goals (e.g. European Green Deal, Marine Strategy Framework Directive), the partnership should aim to achieve a healthy ocean, a sustainable and productive blue economy and the well-being of citizens.
The partnership should increase scientific contributions, applicable in a legal/regulatory context, related to biodiversity, ecosystem conservation and restoration, climate mitigation and adaptation, and pollution, including eutrophication, noise, marine litter and hazardous substances, and should facilitate the use of scientific knowledge by regulators and policy-makers, contributing to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the farm to fork strategy, the mission in the area “Ocean, seas and waters”, the circular economy action plan and the zero pollution ambition.
The partnership should promote technological, nature-based, social, economic and cultural innovation and experiment with new planning, governance, business and finance models. It should also contribute to the future EU initiative on ocean observation, to the development of a common European ocean data space, to the Ocean Digital Twin and to the implementation of the European Ocean Observing System (EOOS).
The partnership should put the emphasis on the development of basin- or Europe-wide holistic, integrated, systemic and cross-sectoral approaches and foster co-creation processes involving all relevant stakeholders and actors, while remaining operationally manageable. It should engage local, regional and national authorities, industry and businesses, including SMEs, knowledge institutions and citizens through Open Science and an inclusive governance, policy and decision-making. It should harness the full potential of social sciences and humanities (SSH), social innovation and citizen engagement to deliver portfolios of solutions, measures and tools and facilitate their replication, and upscaling. In particular, this topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
It should contribute to improve the quality of life and long-term socio-economic prospects of coastal communities, including women, youth and the most vulnerable groups like indigenous people, in the context of major transitions and rising threats to climate, resources and health, including by increasing their resilience to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with the European Commission’s political vision of leaving no one behind, the wide diversity and heterogeneity in levels of socio-economic, technological, institutional, innovation and skills potential should be taken into account.
The European Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive blue economy should be implemented through a joint programme of activities for high impact, relevance and capacity building, ranging from research to coordination and networking activities, including training, demonstration, communication and dissemination activities in all research and innovation projects of the partnership. Emphasis should be given to demonstration, upscaling and experimentation calls. To ensure effective and smooth implementation, three dedicated pillars of activities within the partnership are needed:
Implementation of joint activities in particular calls for proposals with co-funding from the Union.
Implementation of joint activities without co-funding from the Union.
A broad set of activities supporting coordination, international cooperation and outreach, uptake of results etc.
These activities should be structured along the following main building blocks of activities:
Development of work programmes as implementation steps of the high-level Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA). This SRIA should be included in the proposal, outlining implementation modalities and building on existing SRIAs or equivalent in the EU sea basins. It should include the demonstration of the achievability of policy targets at sea-basin scale.
Joint calls for challenge-driven R&I to address critical issues for a sustainable climate-neutral blue economy with integrated and multi-stakeholder approaches.
Setting-up a multi-stakeholder community of practice to facilitate science-policy-business-society dialogues, share experiences and disseminate results and innovations on key issues for social transition and sustainable development.
Undertaking communication and dissemination measures to make R&I results accessible for all stakeholder groups and users and prepare guidelines, references, tools and trainings for replication and mainstreaming; communicating to citizens and civil society at large, and involving them to achieve policy goals.
Synthesising R&I results and achievements from clusters of projects.
Setting-up (a) knowledge hub(s) to support capacity-building on integrated approaches.
Setting-up rigorous monitoring to follow progress of projects and taking stock of diverse solutions, good practice cases and the contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the partnership and the related policy targets.
Exploring interfaces with public procurement and investment programmes by developing links with other programmes, private funds, etc. to support take-up and larger-scale implementation of tested approaches and solutions.
Given the global dimension of ocean policy, membership and other modalities of participation from organisations and institutions in non-associated third countries is strongly encouraged, in particular key partners bordering the different EU sea basins. International cooperation should contribute to align strategies and research agendas, strengthen data collection, monitoring and sharing, as well as access to infrastructures, promote good practice for maritime policies, promote the exchange and export of key technologies and gradually open up cooperation with new countries outside of Europe. It should support the EU’s strong commitment to the UN Decade of Ocean Science, the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative, the All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance, the BLUEMED Initiative, the Black Sea Synergy and other international initiatives.
The partnership should cover the Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It is expected to include and be open to all relevant public marine/maritime funding organisations and ministries from EU Member States and associated countries as core members, in close cooperation with the private sector, including SMEs and foundations. Appropriate links to other relevant ministries and organisations, including civil society, will be established.
Partners are expected to provide financial and/or in-kind contributions for the governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts for national coordination. The partnership is expected to mobilise EU, national and regional capacities to leverage investments, including from the private sector, increase up-scalability and market accessibility for the developed solutions and thus increase the return to investments.
To ensure the coherence and complementarity of activities, and to leverage knowledge investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to foster close cooperation and synergies with other relevant proposed European Partnerships, notably “Rescuing biodiversity to safeguard life on Earth”, “Safe and Sustainable Food Systems”, “Water security for the planet (Water4All)”, “Zero-emission waterborne transport”, “Clean Energy Transition” and others where relevant, as well as the EIT Climate KIC and the EIT FOOD. The partnership will also be linked to the relevant objectives of the mission in the area of “Ocean, seas and waters”. Proposers are expected to describe in details the way to implement such collaborations.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives. Therefore, the 60 000 EUR threshold provided for in Article 204 (a) of the Financial Regulation No 2018/1046 does not apply. It is expected that the partnership organises joint calls on an annual base and therefore it should consider ample time for the implementation of the co-funded projects. The EU contribution for this action will be implemented in annual instalments of around EUR 20-30 million.
Engaging with managing authorities of European Structural and Investment Funds, as well as others like LIFE, Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III) and Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), during partnership implementation would help increase the implementation of the project outcomes and support and facilitate further uptake.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in future work programme(s) to continue providing support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.
Specific Topic Conditions:
The total indicative budget for the duration of the partnership is EUR 150 million.

","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the farm to fork strategy and the headline ambitions of a ‘Digital Age’ and an ‘Economy that works for people’, leaving no one behind, and the biodiversity strategy, the successful proposals will support smart-farming and agri-environmental monitoring. They will therefore contribute a) to the enhancement of the sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers, and b) to make agriculture benefit from further deployment and exploitation of Environmental Observation data and products through research and innovation related to sensors and sensor data.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Strengthening capacities for smart farming, and thus to enhance the environmental and economic performance of the agricultural sector.
Strengthening capacities for agri-environmental (climate) monitoring, particularly of soil and crop conditions.
Provision of inputs to the work of the Horizon Europe candidate partnership “Agriculture of Data” and the potential R&I mission on soil health.
Scope:
Sensors are increasingly used to enhance agricultural production e.g. through the assessment of environmental and crop conditions as well as through livestock monitoring. The information value of data collected through sensors can be increased through the analysis of the data in combination with other data sets. Reference data may, e.g. be formed by data sets generated by sensors at other places or by satellite and earth observation data or other data sets reflecting on environmental conditions. Data generated locally through sensors is often more precise, in comparison to global / EU-wide / national / or regional data sets.
The interpretation of local data sets benefits from such supra-regional data sets allowing e.g. for comparison of crop conditions, e.g. as basis for developing approaches to adapt agricultural production to climate change or for market analyses. In addition, there is the possibility to upscale the more detailed through sensors locally generated information through the application of data technologies, allowing to generate a data, information and knowledge base. Such bases can serve as input for analyses to serve the agricultural sector as well as environmental, climate, and wider policy monitoring purposes.
Of particular interest in agricultural production are approaches of real-time data generation and processing allowing for instance to better tailor certain production steps, combine different production steps or operate Internets of Things (IoT). Edge computing can play a key role to facilitate and enhance such sensor-based analyses and production approaches.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Development of innovative approaches to use in-situ data collected through sensors used in agricultural production as input to the application of data technologies.
Development of approaches to analyse the data in real time through processing at the source (edge computing) associated with analytics (including AI) in combination with e.g. earth observation data.
Development of innovative approaches to benchmark and tailor agricultural production through sensor data sharing at regional level including the development of business models.
Development of approaches to generate EU-wide data sets through the upscaling of data collected through sensor used in agricultural production (in combination with other data sets, such as satellite data).
Demonstration of how sensor-generated data can be further capitalised for the development of the agricultural sector, other sectors and the public good (including policy-making and implementation).
Based on a stock-taking analysis, proposals should (also) focus on crops currently covered less by (private sector) sensor developments. Approaches towards livestock monitoring and/or approaches towards monitoring of agri-environmental conditions through livestock data should be considered. Proposals should reflect on different bio-geographic conditions in Europe.
Proposals are expected to demonstrate governance and management structures allowing for a steady adaptation of the work schedule of the projects (like a rolling plan); this is expected to allow to adapt the work to the most recent developments and innovations in the field of sensors and sensor data in the public and private domain.
Proposals are expected to reflect on possibilities to interlink (interim) project results or parts of them to the functioning of the forthcoming common European agriculture data space and/or the common European data space for research and innovation, the European Open Science Cloud in cooperation with the European Commission. The potential of internet of things (IoT) technologies should be considered.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will ensure that the approach proposed will be compatible with and improve the tools used and or developed at the European Commission.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

","28 October 2021
","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In support of the Green Deal, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and farm to fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on improving the preparation of multi-actor projects to enable the relevant actors to work in a more co-creative way. The expected outcome of this topic are approaches for developing sound, coherent and well-prepared multi-actor projects, enabling project coordinators to use the complementary knowledge of partners to prepare actions to find ready-to-use solutions. Member States’ authorities and AKIS actors need insights and tools to improve the interaction, connections and drafting skills in particular in the stage before putting down the multi-actor project proposals for selection. This will lead to better informed and engaged stakeholders and users of innovative project results leading to more effective Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) and related platforms.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
1. Improve the drafting of multi-actor project proposals[1] and in particular the involvement of relevant actors with complementary knowledge in a balanced way in the preparatory stage.
2. The policy objectives linked to Cluster 6, such as for instance agroecology, climate, pesticide reduction, reduction of water use etc, as well as the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy and the CAP, the Biodiversity Strategy and the wider bioeconomy research and policies,.
3. The CAP cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[2] . It will provide overall knowledge to the CAP supported projects related to knowledge creation, organisation and sharing.
4. The outcomes will be connecting actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up innovation, in particular:
(a) create added value by better linking research, education, advisors and farming practice and encourage the wider use of available knowledge and innovation;
(b) connect innovation actors and projects at all levels; resulting in faster and wider co-creation and transposition of innovative solutions into practice and communicate to the scientific community the research needs of practice.
Scope:
Proposals should:
Develop ways to improve in particular the preparation of Horizon Europe multi-actor projects to better include at an early stage the needed variety of relevant practice actors in a balanced way and to be able to find useful information for the topic, with the view of strengthening co-creation between all actors even before the start and selection of the project. Make use of potential capacities of national/regional AKIS and AKIS coordination bodies to this effect.
In particular, test out the effect of providing seed funding to fund the preparation phase as happens successfully in European innovation partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) Operational Groups[3] to improve the overall multi-actor quality of project proposals.
Find ways to improve the connection and interaction between Horizon Europe Multi-actor projects and EIP-AGRI Operational Group innovation projects on specific topics before the very start of the multi-actor project, thus improving the interaction between the local/regional/ national level and the EU level and the quality of project proposals. Explore what are multi-actor consortia experiences and questions related to the preparation phase, to better understand which hurdles should be solved to ultimately result in more integration of EIP-AGRI Operational Groups in Horizon Europe Multi-actor projects and a better uptake of the results of EU multi-actor projects at national/regional/local level and vice versa. This should help sharing knowledge across the EU at all levels and between the projects from different funding sources and ultimately result in better prepared project proposals.
Resulting from experience gained during the project, develop guidelines and pathways, maybe at institutional level, to improve the overall quality of the preparation phase of multi-actor projects. As soon as possible, find effective and efficient ways to profit from the initiatives of the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24), boosting women-led innovation in farming and rural areas (HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-01) and the project interlinking national AKISs (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-23). Make use of Member States’ knowledge and innovation experts in the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group to discuss the project strategy and progress in the various stages of the project.
Cover all 27 EU Member States in the project. Make use in all those countries of experts who understand and are able to make an accurate interpretation of the national/regional contexts of practitioners and its impact on improving preparation of multi-actor projects.
Provide all outcomes and materials to the EIP-AGRI, including in the common 'practice abstract' format for EU wide dissemination, as well as to national/regional/local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24) in the requested formats.
The project should run for 5 years and result in guidance on how to improve preparation of multi-actor projects to enable the relevant actors to work in a more co-creative way. The project must implement the multi-actor approach, including partners of multi-actor consortia, of EIP-AGRI Operational Groups, policy makers and AKIS coordination bodies and AKIS actors in Member States. Outcomes should be presented to policy makers at all levels, with a view to adapt policies and governance to improve multi-actor project proposals. The results of the projects should also be disseminated to all those who may start up multi-actor projects or EIP-AGRI Operational Groups.

In support of the Green Deal, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and farm to fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on advisor exchanges across the EU to increase the speed of knowledge creation and sharing, capacity building, of demonstration of innovative solutions, as well as helping to bring them into practice, which accelerates the needed transitions. Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) in which advisors are fully integrated are key drivers to speed up innovation and the uptake of research results by farmers.
Transformative changes such as the ones required within the Green Deal are dynamic processes that require appropriate governance of AKIS actors. Advisors are key actors strongly guiding and with a big influence over producers’ decisions. A novelty in the post- 2020 CAP plans[1] is that advisors now must be integrated within the Member States’ AKIS, and that the scope of their actions has become much broader. They must now be able to cover economic, environmental and social domains, as well as be informed on up-to-date science and technology. They should be able to translate this knowledge into opportunities, and use and adapt those to specific local circumstances. This specific topic focuses on the important role advisors can play related to climate change effects on water shortage, water pollution and avoiding salty soils, a quickly upcoming issue in the more sustainable agriculture of the future.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
The most urgent policy objectives linked to Cluster 6, as well as the European Green Deal, and in particular the Farm to Fork Strategy and the CAP, with a view to increase farmer viability, help raise awareness and tackle societal challenges in helping the reduction of water pollution and use;
The CAP cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[2] . This topic will help to fill gaps on emerging advisory topics beyond the classical sectorial advice, which is useful in particular in relation with the new obligation for Member States to integrate advisors within their AKIS which must cover a much broader scope than in the former period. It will provide overall support related to knowledge creation, organisation and sharing.
Development of interaction with regional policy makers and of a potential EU network to discuss institutional barriers to practical water-related issues, such as bottlenecks, lock-ins, political inertia, ambiguous regulations, inequality between Member States and power imbalances;
Production of supporting services and materials to facilitate the upscaling of prevention of water shortage and pollution, such as water audit schemes, novel water retention practices, water knowledge networks and peer-to-peer counselling, master classes, advice modules, communication and education materials, effective business models for farm management on dry soils, etc
The outcomes should speed up introduction, spreading and bringing into practice of innovative solutions related to avoiding water shortage and pollution overall, in particular by:
creating added value by better linking research, education, advisors and farming practice and encouraging the wider use of available knowledge across the EU;
learning from innovation actors and projects, resulting in faster sharing and implementation of ready-to-use innovative solutions, spreading them into practice and communicating to the scientific community the bottom-up research needs of practice.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following activities:
Connect advisors having a broad and extensive network of farmers across all EU Member States in an EU advisory network dedicated to water use, including avoiding water shortage and pollution, with a view to sharing experiences on how to best tackle the issues, building on the outcomes of the EIP-AGRI “Focus Group on Water and Agriculture”[3], the EIP-AGRI Workshop: “Connecting innovative projects: Water & Agriculture”[4], and the H2020 “Thematic network to improve water management”[5]
Share effective and novel approaches among the EU advisory network on water use, which are sustainable in terms of economic, environmental and social aspects.
Take strong account of cost-benefit elements. Collect and document good examples in this regard, connecting with farmers, intermediates and consumers in Member States to be able to take into account financial aspects and local conditions. Select the best practices, learn about the key success factors, possible quick wins and make them available for (local) exploitation, to ensure financial win-wins for producers, citizens and water companies.
Integrate the advisors of the EU water use network into their Member State AKIS as much as possible. They should encourage as innovation brokers innovative projects on water use solutions in European innovation partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) Operational Groups. They should give hands-on training to farmers and local advisors, lead national thematic and learning networks on the subject, deliver and implement action plans to make water use more efficient, reduce farmers’ water use and pollution, inspire new and incoming farmers or farms at the cross-roads of intergenerational renewal, connect with education and ensure broad communication, support peer-to-peer consulting, develop on-farm demonstrations and YouTube demo films, and provide specific back-office support for generalist advisors within the national / regional AKIS.
Explore if the activities of the EU advisory network on water use can be up scaled at the level of a number of Member States under a cooperative format. Wherever possible, develop digital advisory tools for common use across the EU. Seek if common tools can be created to incentivise the implementation of the learnings from this project.
Include all 27 EU Member States in the EU advisory network, using local AKIS connections which can more accurately interpret the national/regional contexts to help develop the best solutions for that Member State or region. Use the support of the Member States’ knowledge and innovation experts of the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group to discuss project strategy and progress in the various stages of the 2 projects. Projects should run at least 5 years. They must implement the multi-actor approach.
Provide all outcomes and materials to the EIP-AGRI, including in the common 'practice abstract' format for EU wide dissemination, as well as to national / regional / local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24) in the requested formats.

The successful proposal(s) will enhance new knowledge and design or improve tools to achieve better informed decision-making processes, social engagement and innovation, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal. Proposals will contribute to the development or improvement of innovative multi-layer governance models enabling sustainability and resilience and of EU and international science-policy interfaces.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Better understanding by the policy making community of the institutional barriers such as lock-ins, path dependency, bounded rationality, political inertia and power imbalances in the formulation and implementation of marine policies.
The policy making community exploited analyses and better understanding of formal and informal policy governance work streams or processes, including public consultation and encompassing local, regional, national, European and global ocean governance aspects.
Stronger e-government and easily achievable open government data facilitate greater access to public services.
Appropriate communication, exchange, coordination and management is enabled at regional, national and European level.
Improved collaborative governance performance allowing social and technical innovations to provide opportunities for the social contract between the State and the citizenry through increased transparency, enabling better spatial planning and natural resource management, ultimately leading to increased trust in policy making.
Scope:
The management of the ocean, seas and coasts is largely carried out in a fragmented manner, at institutional as well as legal governance level and through several related sectors. Poor coordination between sectoral approaches, low institutional capacity, weak implementation of international conventions and lack of technical knowledge and of financial resources for regional, cross-regional and national processes are common issues in Member States and partner countries, affecting coastal communities severely in terms of food security and livelihoods (loss of jobs). Current policy governance models and work streams, including public consultation, at different governance levels, need to be analysed in relation to their performance and further challenged to intensify regional and local integration in the policy dialogue, as the (total, regional and local) transitions towards a sufficiently protected marine natural capital and health and wellbeing of citizens should also be just and inclusive. Proposals should address the need to meet increasing public demands and to address declining public trust.
Proposals should conceptualise and operationalise strategies to address identified barriers to collaborative governance related to the ocean and seas based on a long-term perspective using a participatory process of visioning and experimentation, accompanied by strong and justified recommendations on the required capacity building.
Proposals should improve or develop and leverage innovative digital tools, towards a stronger e-government and easily achievable open government data.
The proposals should cover comparisons within, across and between different spatial governance layers (local, regional, inter-regional, macro-regional, cross-border, international) to cover a representative set of governance structures across Europe varying according to size and geographical, environmental, socio-economic, institutional and administrative conditions.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
Interactive research approaches should be used to engage with local, regional, national and international authorities, as well as local communities, citizens and other relevant stakeholders, considering gender, age and socio-economic background, where relevant.
Projects should build on existing knowledge and integrate results from multiple origins, including other EU, international (for example UN) or national projects or studies. Some cooperation activities with projects financed under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-06 on environmental and social cross-compliance of marine policies could be included. This topic should also be linked to the Horizon Europe Mission Ocean, seas and waters and the Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy or other partnerships where relevant.

The successful proposal will contribute to innovative governance and sound decision making in agricultural policies for the green transition. In particular, they will contribute to achieving better informed decision-making processes, to establishing and monitoring innovative governance models enabling sustainability and resilience through enhanced and shared use of new knowledge, tools, foresight, and environmental observations as well as digital, modelling and forecasting capabilities. They will also contribute to strengthened EU science-policy interfaces to support the European Green Deal and to achieve the sustainable development goals.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
policymakers are supported with cutting-edge tools and methods to design, monitor and implement tailored and results-based common agricultural policy (CAP) strategic plans that fully reflect the ambition of the Green Deal, in particular the farm to fork strategy and the biodiversity strategy;
accountability of the CAP strategic plans is improved through SMART[1] targets for improved performance against clear baselines, which are coherent with EU objectives and international commitments; and
good practices on the application of innovative tools and methods are widely shared and used across Member States.
Scope:
Agri-food systems are key sectors for the delivery of the objectives of the European green deal while the CAP is the most important EU policy mechanism with the capacity to have a significant impact on the agricultural dimension of these systems at European level.
In the new results-based delivery model of the CAP, Member States are in charge of tailoring CAP interventions to maximise their contribution to EU objectives and to achieve agreed targets. In developing their CAP strategic plans, Member States need to analyse their specific situation and needs, set their targets and design the interventions that will allow them to reach these targets, while being adapted to the national and specific regional contexts.
They also have a say in designing the compliance and control framework applicable to beneficiaries while continuing to ensure effective monitoring and enforcement of the attainment of all policy objectives.
Proposals should:
Review and benchmark existing tools and/or methods used in different Member States to support the development, implementation and monitoring of effective CAP strategic plans.
Develop, test and demonstrate a set of innovative tools and/or methods, both qualitative and quantitative, to evaluate the design and support the implementation and monitoring of effective CAP strategic plans.
The proposed tools and/or methods should:
take into account all objectives and policy instruments post-2020 CAP;
enable analysis of coherence between the multiple instruments of the CAP as well as with other EU policies and international commitments;
be compatible with and/or innovative in relation to the tools and methods used by the European Commission.
Apply and evaluate potentials and limitations of the proposed tools to different case studies within Member States, with attention given to balanced geographical coverage and taking into account the diversity of farming systems across the EU, including the outermost regions, and different government structures, e.g. regional / federal administration approaches.
Develop methodological protocols and guidelines for the users of the tools and methods.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will ensure access to and improve the tools, methods and databases supporting the design and evaluation of CAP strategic plans based on scientific evidence. In particular it will contribute to the adjustment, further development, and application of existing modelling tools used by the Commission for the foresight analysis of CAP strategic plans, their coherence with the CAP, other EU policies and commitments, and their impact at EU, national, regional and farm level.

Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improve policy implementation for securing sustainable water use across sectors, while insuring transparency and inclusiveness
Promote a better integrated planning approach across water-using sectors
Help to link water management to the economic and social development sectors.
Support coordination between water policies and other relevant policies and coordination of planning measures across relevant EU and national instruments for sustainable water use
Empower citizens by increasing their motivation and capacity to influence effective water governance decisions.
Help society to implement through governance, the technological, economic, political, and social measures that will set a course toward the achievement of a desirable, more sustainable and secure water future.
Support the implementation of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals, notably SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”
Scope:
Changing the way water is used, managed and shared with people, our environment and our economy, addressing trade-offs and ensuring policy coherence, and helping shape the appropriate institutional environment to deal with the complexity of multiple water challenges and the design of the water systems of the future, requires effective development and implementation of sound water management and governance strategies. The governance and institutional set up must be designed to respect the needs of the natural aquatic environment in terms of water quantity (water allocation) and quality, reconcile the competing demands of the economy over water resources and drive the transition in water using sectors towards operation within the sustainability limits.
Water problems are commonly the results of governance problems. Technical solutions often exist, but clarity is often lacking as to who does what, at which level and how. Implementing appropriate governance schemes or designing new multi-level governance and institutional settings for the implementation of sound water management, will help to achieve sustainable use of natural resources, as well as prevent pollution and protect biodiversity.
This topic aims to validate innovative multi-level water governance practices among various stakeholders to strengthen policy integration, coherence and coordination and assess their impacts on economy, social well-being and environment.
Actions should assess current governance approaches and organisational models in different river basins to optimise water governance and integrate it with other sectors, such as energy, agriculture, land use and urbanisation, and to overcome fragmentation in public policy formulation and decision-making. They should also aim to understand how different operational governance contexts at various levels, influence the effective realisation of sustainable water management in practice and explore the interaction among governance approaches at different spatial and temporal scales with a view to understanding potential conflicts and strengthening synergies.
Research should also address ways to value water and develop appropriate tariffs and pricing policies to ensure both access to water and sufficient funds for systematic renewal of water service infrastructure, as well as ecosystems restoration.
Innovative mechanisms should be developed to promote stakeholder engagement and involvement of public participation in defining and developing methods for collaborative approaches, as well as to promote social innovation, effective communication platforms, encourage exchange of know-how, expertise, eliminate frustration, minimize risks of distortion, and increase citizens’ responsibility.
The role of appropriate economic policy instruments, financing and business models (investments, risk management, water pricing, cost-benefits…) in governance towards ensuring long term financial sustainability and increasing investments in the water sector, should be also assessed.
Actions to effectively implement appropriate governance approaches in practice, taking into consideration research insights, and to support the implementation of relevant governance indicators, such as, those developed by OECD, including the assessment of their performance, should be also supported.
In general, the participation of academia, research organisations, utilities, industry and regulators is strongly advised, as well as civil society engagement whenever necessary, also aiming to broaden the dissemination and exploitation routes and to better assess the innovation potential of developed solutions and strategies.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.

","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In support of the Green Deal, CAP and Farm to Fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on knowledge sharing in a language that is easy to understand and is targeted to farmers and foresters. Primary producers have a particular need for impartial and tailored knowledge on the management choices related to the needs, challenges or opportunities they experience. This speeds up innovation and the uptake of results, and is key to improve sustainability. It adds value to the knowledge and cost-effectiveness of innovative practices and techniques in and across primary production sectors, food systems, bioeconomy and biodiversity. This will lead to more informed and engaged stakeholders and users of project results including primary producers and consumers thanks to effective platforms such as Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS[1]).
Despite the continued funding of scientific projects, innovative ideas and methods from practice are not captured and spread, and often research findings are not integrated into agricultural and forestry practice. Proposals, acting at EU level to remedy this situation, are essential because national and sectoral AKISs are insufficiently connected and organised to fully meet the challenge of intensifying thematic cooperation between researchers, advisors and farmers/foresters. This exchange of knowledge will foster economically viable and sustainable agriculture and forestry and build trust between the main AKIS actors.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
The cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[2] , as well as European Green Deal and Farm to Fork objectives;
The collection and distribution of easily accessible practice-oriented knowledge on the thematic area chosen, in particular the existing best practices and research findings that are ready to be put into practice, but not sufficiently known or used by practitioners.
Conserve practical knowledge for the long term - beyond the project period – in particular by using the main trusted dissemination channels that farmers/foresters consult most often.
Increase the flow of practical information between farmers/foresters in the EU in a geographically balanced way, creating spill-overs and taking account of the differences between territories. In order to better reach and capture knowledge from the targeted farmers/foresters, the networks may organise 'cross-fertilisation' through sub-networks covering, for example, a region, a language or a production system;
Achieve greater user acceptance of collected solutions and a more intensive dissemination of existing knowledge, by connecting actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up innovation and promote the faster and wider co-creation and transposition of innovative solutions into practice.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following activities:
Tackle the most urgent farmers’ or foresters' needs by summarising, sharing and presenting - in a language that is easy to understand and is targeted to farmers and foresters – the existing best practices and research findings that are ready to be put into practice, but not sufficiently known or used by practitioners. The specific themes of the networks can be chosen in a 'bottom-up' way on the condition that they.
Compile a comprehensive description of the state of current farming practices on the chosen theme to explain the added-value of the proposal and the relevance of the theme. Proposals must focus on the cost/benefit aspects of the practices collected and summarised, and clarify how the project avoids duplication with ongoing or completed projects and networks.
Deliver an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing end-user material for farmers and foresters. This info should be easy to access and understand, making use of audio-visual material wherever possible, including also materials serving education and training;
This range of material should feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by farmers and foresters in the countries.
As many “practice abstracts” in the common European innovation partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) format as possible, as well as other type of materials should be provided to the EIP-AGRI, as well as to national / regional / local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24);

","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Through the development of new technologies a successful proposal will contribute to addressing the lack of ground observation (in-situ observation)[1] necessary to cope with climate change effects in hard-to-reach areas, areas facing extreme physical conditions and critical areas for human health and security. As such contributing to the European Green Deal objectives and a strengthened Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), by deploying and adding value to environmental observation[2].
Proposals are expected to contribute to at least four of the following outcomes:
Lower cost of in-situ observation in terms of capital cost, deployment/recovery, and maintain leading;
Improved geographical coverage and long-time series of in situ environmental observations;
Tested and validated new in-situ measurement technologies in hard-to-reach under-sampled areas;
Dedicated technical protocols ensuring validation, interoperability, and synchronisation between in-situ and remote sensing systems in compliance with the GEOSS and Copernicus requirements;
Established collaboration with environmental observation data providers to ensure proper gap filling and adequate responses in terms of acquisition protocols;
Coherent business model(s) involving industrialists, research centres, and users ensuring the sustainability of systems developed;
Contribute to reinforcing the in-situ component of the GEO initiative, the Copernicus programme and the EC-ESA initiative on Earth system science, and to strengthen in-situ observations to adequately complement the space-based observations planned through Copernicus Expansion Missions.
Scope:
The geographical coverage and acquisition of long time series of in-situ observation of the various components of the Earth’s systems should be improved in order to ensure a proper monitoring and modelling of the environmental processes. This is recognised in the context of the Copernicus programme, by the GOOS 2030 Strategy, and was reiterated at global level at the GEO Ministerial Summit[3] in November 2019 in the Canberra Ministerial Declaration[4]. This topic is intended to support innovative technological solutions building on cutting-edge technologies in the domain of measurement and testing, big data and ICT to acquire necessary parameters from in-situ measurements required to ensure an integrated monitoring and model data assimilation necessary to respond to the climate transition and the European Green Deal challenges. This call covers marine and/or terrestrial measurements in hard-to-reach areas or areas with extreme physical conditions such as the polar regions, the tropical regions and desert regions, the deep-sea, and the high-altitude regions where the lack of in-situ data makes global assessment and mitigation of climate change effects very challenging. Proposals could also address geographical and high temporal resolution gaps in observations such as the real-time monitoring of aeroallergens or other atmospheric aerosols affecting health. The proposals should be conducted, inter alia, in collaboration with Copernicus and other, relevant activities[5] and communities in order to guaranty coherent approaches regarding the acquisition of new in-situ data and development of related monitoring systems – in particular in view of supporting the calibration of remote-sensing data. During the development of the systems, special attention should be given to data management, standardisation and dissemination issues.
The development of new in-situ observation systems should be conducted in close collaboration with the commercial sector. The sustainability of the systems beyond the duration of the project should be part of the work plan of the proposal and be the subject of concrete actions with the relevant partners in the proposal (users, industrialists, research organisations, including European research infrastructures).

A successful proposal will contribute to the deployment of and adding value to environmental observations[1], focussing on how the use of environmental observation can contribute to the ‘One Health’ domain, in line with the European Green Deal objectives.
Proposals are expected to contribute to at least three of the following outcomes:
Better insights in how to foster the use of environmental observation in the large domain of One Health[2] and the areas within this domain that could benefit the most from environmental and Earth observation;
An increase of the capacity to trace environmental parameter changes on how they impact on the emergence of diseases;
Monitoring of the evolution of ecosystem barriers and reinforcement of their sustainability, specifically in densely populated or intensively used areas;
Contributing to understanding the emergence and tackling the spread of new infectious diseases affecting human, animal or plant health, and the interlinkages that may exist between them and building up of more resilient ecosystems;
Better insights into the concept of alert and early warning systems, including, where possible, the next steps taken (e.g. exploitation/scaling up) in working with the outcomes of the EIC Horizon Prize on Early Warning for Epidemics[3].
Scope:
The general scope of this topic is to explore areas of the One Health policy that would benefit from the use of environmental observation and how environmental observations can be used for further shaping policies in the context of e.g. human health, animal health (including zoonoses) and plant health.
The proposal should build on the holistic integrative concept of ‘One Health’ that includes not only the health of humans, but also of animals, soil and plants including ecosystems and environmental health. Information deriving from environmental observation combined with health data over the broad range of the One Health concept should be delivered through an integrated approach aggregating all the components of the One Health with the intention to support related policies within the health area in a comprehensive way.
A specific focus of the proposal should be on the monitoring of the evolution of ecosystem barriers in densely populated, industrialised or agricultural areas. The proposal should also investigate how environmental observations could provide information that can contribute to improving the effectiveness, sustainability and resilience of these ecosystem barriers in facing emerging diseases. The proposal should include the reanalysis of long time series of environmental observations and their correlation with the emergence or spread of diseases.
It should also work on the concept of alert or early warning systems based on observation that would contribute informing governments and authorities, and finally operators, on the health risks related to the destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity with a One Health approach, including a consideration of disease hazards, human (or animal) exposure and vulnerability. Research on the risk for human health and ecosystems of new contaminants could help early detection and reduce negative effects within the One Health domain. A particular area of interest in this context is the follow up to the EIC Horizon Prize on Early Warning for Epidemics[4] and how the insights gained from the outcomes of the prize could be further developed.
Links to the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), and the EU satellite navigation programme (EGNSS) are relevant and expected.

","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as with the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will involve the mobilisation of society to transform food systems for co-benefits. This will lead to innovative governance models enabling sustainability and resilience, which achieve better-informed decision-making processes, societal engagement, and innovative solutions.
With the overarching aim to help transform food systems for co-benefits to nutrition and health, climate, environment, biodiversity, circularity and communities, the project will:
Build on the Fit4Food2030[1] initiative to further the mobilisation of all relevant Food System public and private sector stakeholders, researchers, non-governmental organisations, educators, knowledge brokers, media and society, to work together via an interlinked structure at the level of cities, regions, and countries across Europe, and that supports mutual learning and good practices.
A new and improved structured network of evidence-based policy labs throughout Europe so as to raise awareness, foster joint action, good practices and knowledge sharing amongst stakeholders relevant to food system policy developments and implementation at various levels: local, regional, national, EU and international level. Key to this will be the inclusion of decision and policy makers, scientists, and public authorities to ensure the sustainability and legitimacy of the governance process.
Increased pan-European citizen engagement, social innovation and co-creation through local or regional living labs; promote food systems science education for children and youth while respecting national competence in the area of education and health, and measure the food systems transition progress in society.
Scope:
Successful proposals are expected to:
Establish a pan-European Food 2030 multi-actor and public engagement mechanism to raise food system awareness and foster more citizen (including youth) involvement and interest in science, research and innovation, necessary to foster support for a food system transformation that delivers co-benefits.
Engage a network of science museums to co-create and deploy a Food 2030 “food systems lab” inspired by the Oceans Plastic Lab[2] to be deployed across Europe linking in particular to EU presidencies, important global meetings (e.g.: COP), and other relevant place-based initiatives (like I-Capital, Green Capital, etc.).
Support emerging relevant citizen science projects at local level (neighbourhoods, towns and cities), conduct hackathons, hold science cafés, and set up a dedicated video channel to display food systems success stories, all with the aim of raising awareness of the need to transform food systems and to co-create citizen-inspired solutions.
Develop and deploy innovative interactive food systems education material in support of both the informal and formal education of children and youth (including gender-specific messaging) across Europe while respecting national competence in the area of education and health, in cooperation with relevant European school networks, associations and local media outlets.
Facilitate the cooperation of relevant EU Horizon Europe projects to arrive at a common language and explore/set common goals, discuss potential farm to fork strategy and Green Deal interventions, all with a view to strengthen co-ownership and cooperation, share and communicate knowledge, boost innovation and increase take-up of improved policy schemes among the food system actors, and society.
Measurement of food systems transition progress by, for example, conducting surveys or employing sentiment analyses that demonstrates society’s level of interest and willingness to transform food systems for co-benefits and the perceive trade-offs.
Explain and map how co-benefits will be achieved relevant to the four Food 2030 priorities[3]: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowerment of communities.
Involving a wide diversity of food system actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research is expected to implement the required multi actor approach (cf eligibility conditions).
The project should set out a clear plan on how it will collaborate with other projects selected under this and any other relevant topic/call, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities.

","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The successful proposal will support the deployment of business-to-consumers communication by producers and traders of bio-based products to enable responsible production and consumption in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU bioeconomy strategy and the European Climate Pact. Project outcomes will contribute to improve the sustainability performance and competitiveness in the bio-based systems and to the establishment of the innovative governance models notably to achieve better-informed decision-making processes, social engagement and innovation. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Transparency of bio-based products and information to consumers and public authorities are provided through effective and robust business-to-consumers labelling on product traceability, quality, carbon footprint, biodiversity impacts and other environmental footprints.
Consumers, industry and public bodies are enabled to switch towards socially and environmentally responsible behaviour within their choices in a transparent and inclusive way.
Improved understanding of metrics on value generated per unit of biological resources.
Scope:
The project is expected to advance the role and impact of bio-based innovation to accelerate the transition from a linear fossil-based economy, which leads to overuse and depletion of natural resources, into resource-efficient and circular bio-based systems operating within safe planetary boundaries. Improved and informed governance and social innovation contribute to reducing resource consumption and result in an increased innovation capacity of all actors. Informed consumers may pursue the objectives of circular economy, asking for efficiency and inclusiveness of services provided through less resources and goods, changing consumption patterns (e.g. reducing meat consumption), preventing food waste and separating bio-waste from other waste streams so that it can be (partly) converted to bio-based materials.
Proposals will focus on consumer-oriented labelling options for industrial bio-based products with low environmental footprint, in terms of resources, processes and materials used. Industrial bio-based products do not include food/feed, biofuels, bioenergy and cultural/recreation sectors. However, relevant initiatives in the field of consumer-focussed labelling of sustainability of bio-based products, arising from EU policies in the bioeconomy sectors, should be taken into account.
Proposals should:
Select a range of bio-based systems where value chains can be monitored in their environmental and social impacts (benefits and trade-offs) from the primary materials trade to the final products.
Develop pre- and co-normative research to design or update standards and labels for business-to-consumers communication of climate-neutrality and environmental impacts/benefits/trade-offs and performances of materials and products. Environmental impacts should include carbon footprint, climate neutrality, biodiversity impacts and any other environmental footprint relevant for the specific bio-based value chain and final products. Metrics on value generated, in the final product, per unit of biological feedstock used, including bio-waste, will be assessed.
Develop guidelines on the design of labels for bio- based products that include the perspectives of public authorities (national, regional, local) and consumers.
Assess existing/develop new monitoring system and indicators of effectiveness and robustness of existing business-to-consumers labels and certification schemes.
Demonstrate/test effectiveness of existing (voluntary) business-to-consumers labels and certification schemes and monitor robustness. This action includes the identification of labels and certification schemes and testing of the monitoring system and indicators assessed/developed.
Assess costs and benefits from the adoption of business-to-consumers labels and certification schemes in selected bio-based systems.
Assess and develop smart options for the consumers in the digital age (e.g. mobile applications) aiming at sound understanding and practical use in support of and complying with the current relevant legal framework.
Analyse social measures to enable consumers to switch towards socially and environmentally responsible behaviour within their choices (e.g. regulatory measures, corporate responsibility initiatives, education), ensuring inclusiveness of all actors (NGOs, civil society etc) and taking into account differences between gender, age and socio-economic background.
The proposals should seek complementarities with related actions on bio-based innovation and market measures[1], e.g. synergies with the food systems if appropriate[2] or any other sector, and ensure inclusiveness and engagement of all actors along bio-based value chains.

","10 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will contribute to the wide deployment of and adding value to environmental observations[1], by improving the uptake and validation of data collected by citizens and by increasing citizen involvement and engagement, thus contributing to the European Green Deal objectives and a strengthened Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).
Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
A more widespread participation of citizens, (e.g. new and/or existing associations/groupings of citizens observers) in the monitoring, observation, and protection of the urban environment, complementary to governmental measures;
Greater availability of qualitative and quantitative in-situ data for long time series and better geographical coverage, contributing to the in-situ component of existing observation systems (such as Copernicus[2], European research infrastructures[3] and GEOSS);
Broader use of data and information collected by citizens in policy and research, with crowdsourcing and citizen observations acknowledged as valuable information complementary to authoritative observations;
Increased use of existing toolkits and development of new toolboxes (methodologies, methods, technologies) for broad use, which could include the development of efficient passive sampling systems;
Leveraged use of wearables for citizens and other low-cost technologies in the domain of environmental observation.
Scope:
Successful proposals are expected to support citizen engagement, specifically the active role of citizens in the collection and use of data and information within the urban environment to complement the data and information collected through other means of observation (space-based, airborne, etc.). The proposals selected under this topic should increase societal awareness about the urban environment and lead to an increase in actions necessary to protect it. The proposals should contribute to more comprehensive and available data and information of good quality to assess the state of the urban environment in support of the climate transition and the European Green Deal and to the GEO initiatives related to urban environment and urban resilience.
The information derived by the selected projects should help in shaping policies targeting the monitoring and greening of the urban environment, in addition to monitoring schemes already set out by public authorities at different levels (regional, national, European, even global).
Proposals should pay particular attention to encouraging the validation and uptake of citizen observations for policy and compliance use.
The proposals should ensure that the observations/data produced will be available on relevant existing platforms such as GEOSS, European research infrastructures, INSPIRE[4] and EMODNet[5].
The sustainability of the (existing) validation methods should be ensured for a broader use in the future, through the development of toolboxes, containing tested methodologies, methods and technologies.
The social and cultural dimensions of the citizen observation should be given due consideration within the proposals and therefore be looking into possibilities to engage citizens through e.g. social innovative[6], cultural or art-related initiatives. This should be in the context of further engaging and raising the interest and awareness of all citizens in observing their environments, but also in looking into the possibilities for co-creation of solutions for the urban environment. Particular attention should be paid to engaging women and marginalised groups, such as ethnic minorities and disabled persons, in co-creation efforts.
Particular attention should be directed to cooperation between different groups of engaged citizen observers, strengthening mutual learning and the exchange of good practices (in particular with respect to data quality). This could include the build-up of skills, capacity and networking possibilities between citizen associations to help them get involved in citizen observations. Applicants should seek cooperation with local, regional, national and European environmental agencies.
Selected projects are expected to be developed in co-creation and to build upon the results of the WeObserve project[7], as well as demonstrating measures to communicate and cooperate with other relevant citizen science projects[8] funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe as far as possible.
The Commission Staff Working Document ‘Best Practices in Citizen Science for Environmental Monitoring’[9] published on 27 July 2020 is of interest in the context of this topic.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
Projects should seek to contribute to the New European Bauhaus initiative by supporting the green and digital transitions in communities’ living environments through merging sustainability, inclusiveness and quality of experience. Projects, by considering the social and cultural dimensions of citizen observation of the urban environment, are well placed to contribute to the objectives of the initiative by bringing the European Green Deal into citizens’ lives and living spaces.

A successful proposal will support the deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers for the European Green Deal priorities, the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050 and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system. It will help to bring about innovative and inclusive governance, better informed decision-making processes, social engagement, and innovation.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the expected outcomes:
empower citizens to exercise their “data rights” and to contribute to a just transition of food systems
pilot digital solutions in food systems and nutrition with enhanced personal data protection and data sovereignty and which achieve a fairer distribution of wealth and benefits
advance alternative approaches to food system data sharing that promote innovation and increase competition
Scope:
Proposals should support the implementation of the European Data Strategy[1] in food systems. The European Data Strategy has the ambition to make the EU the leading role model for a society empowered by data, for the benefit of all. It outlines a future in which the way that data is collected and used, places the individual first, in accordance with European values, fundamental rights and rules. It also emphasises that citizens will only trust and embrace much needed data-driven innovations – in food systems and beyond - if they are confident that any personal data sharing in the EU is compliant with strict data protection rules and respectful of their data sovereignty[2]. Current centralised platforms for big and social data management in food systems tend to consolidate the dominance of existing incumbent actors. They allow limited control over the data by citizens (e.g. food purchasing data, data from wearables on activity and health, online behaviour regarding diet and food, data from personalised nutrition solutions), and enable lock-ins by limiting data portability.
Proposals should build on recent research and innovation[3] about new architectures for managing online identity, personal and other data as an alternative to current dominant models. They should pilot new approaches to digital solutions in food systems and nutrition, which enhance personal data protection and data sovereignty, and which achieve a fairer distribution of wealth and benefits. The pilots should test and fine-tune new approaches that address the lack of sovereignty of European citizens on food and nutrition related data, and allow them to decide what is done with their data (purchasing data, data on dietary behaviour, nutritional health data, physical activity data). This data also includes the data that is generated by smart connected devices used by citizens. The tools and concepts of the pilots can include consent management tools, personal information management apps (including fully centralised solutions building on blockchain), as well as personal data cooperatives or trusts acting as novel neutral intermediaries in the personal data economy.
Proposals and their pilots should demonstrate the feasibility of achieving a more acceptable trade-off between the need for data-driven innovation in food and nutrition and the need for personal data protection and data sovereignty. They should be focused on 2 key areas of digital transformation and data driven innovation in food systems (such as online food retail, home delivery of food, personalised nutrition, digital tracking of food and nutrition related consumer behaviour, food advertising) whose future development is likely to have significant impact on reaching the objectives and targets of the EU’s Farm-to-Fork Strategy, on meeting the EU's Climate ambition for 2030 and 2050 and on contributing to a just transition[4]. Proposals should explain and map how the pilots will achieve co-benefits relevant to the four Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowerment of communities. Gender aspects should be considered, where relevant.
Proposals may provide support to third parties to develop and implement the pilots. This support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. As a reference, 50% of the EU funding can be allocated to financial support to the third parties, through grant amounts that are in the EUR 150 000 to 300 000 range. The amounts are deemed sufficient to pilot solutions that enough impact to be able to advance alternative approaches to food system data sharing. Proposals should focus their support for the pilots on third party projects from outstanding academic research groups, start-ups and SMEs, so that multiple third parties can be funded in parallel contributing to the same key area of digital transformation and data driven innovation, using short research cycles targeting the most promising ideas. Each of the selected third parties projects should pursue its own pilot and objectives, while the proposal should provide the programme logic and vision, the necessary technical support, as well as coaching and mentoring, in order that the collection of third party projects and pilots contributes towards a significant advancement and impact in the key area. The focus should be on advanced research that can be brought quickly to the market; apps and services that innovate without a research component are not covered by this model.
Proposals should make explicit their capacity to attract top talent, to bring about disruptive innovation in line with EU policy objectives, to engage with a broad range of with food system actors and stakeholders as well as with communities and citizens, to deliver a solid value-adding services package to the third party projects, as well as their expertise and capacity in managing the full life-cycle of the open calls transparently. They should explore synergies with other research and innovation actions, supported at regional, national or European level, to increase the overall impact.
Where possible they should make data available for broader communal use (as part of “data commons for food and nutrition”) and seek integration of the data and value-added services on those data through federated infrastructure such as the European Open Science Cloud.

WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES?
Activities by volunteering teams in high-priority areas will aim to:
- address clearly defined unmet societal challenges in the area of “promoting healthy lifestyles” and/ or “preservation of cultural heritage”;
- promote solidarity across the participating countries;
- enable the young volunteer(s) to gain skills and competences which are useful for their personal, educational, social and professional development;
- provide tangible benefits to the communities within which the activities are carried out;
- ensure a direct contact between the participant and the beneficiaries of the solidarity-related activities, to enable the young volunteer to gain skills that are useful for their educational and social development;
- reach out to young people with fewer opportunities, including refugees, asylum seekers and migrants;
- promote diversity, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue - and the EU values of human dignity, freedom, equality and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities - as well as projects enhancing media literacy, critical thinking and a sense of initiative among young people;
- reinforce the capacities and international scope of the participating organisations;
- raise participants’ awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries, offering them the opportunity to build networks of international contacts, to actively participate in society and to develop a sense of European citizenship and identity.
Scope:
WHAT ARE VOLUNTEERING TEAMS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS?
Volunteering Teams in high priority areas are large scale, high impact projects supporting voluntary activities carried out by young people from at least two different countries coming together to express solidarity by implementing short-term interventions that address common European challenges in policy areas defined each year at EU level.
WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES OF 2022 CALL FOR THIS ACTION?
PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES
The programme can add significant value by promoting healthy lifestyles. Sport and physical activity are key in preventing diseases and ensuring quality of life, and they contribute to social inclusion and well-being. Obesity and inactivity are steadily on the rise in Europe with serious effects on health. The importance of sport and physical activity for our health and well-being as well as the urgency to promote healthier lifestyles became even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
The programme can provide significant value when it comes to raising the awareness of and preserving Europe’s cultural heritage. Supported projects should aim to mobilise volunteers around enhancing access to cultural heritage for all, or reconversion of heritage infrastructure with a high social purpose and a low carbon footprint. New participatory and inter-cultural approaches to heritage will be promoted."

","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Systemic demonstration of a climate-resilient society, fully adapted to the unavoidable impacts of climate change by 2050, based on full scale technological and social innovation solutions on the ground providing reinforced adaptive capacity and minimised vulnerability to climate impacts, in line with the Paris Agreement and the European Climate Law[1] ;
Innovative climate resilience socio-technological solutions are scaled up and largely deployed through collaboration and twinning between front-runners and less experienced regions , vulnerable to similar climate risks and impacts;
Suitable solutions for just societal transformation and building climate resilience at the regional and local level are developed and adopted, through tailor-made measures matching the local needs, as climate impacts, adaptive capacities and disaster risk reduction capabilities differ greatly across regions.
Scope:
This topic relates to the Mission’s third objective, aiming to deliver at least 75 deep demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience.
Proposals under this topic must deploy large-scale demonstrations of scientifically sound innovative solutions, combining technological and social innovation, with concrete measurable impacts leading to an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change across the territory of the European Union and associated countries[2].
As climate impacts, adaptive capacities and disaster risk reduction capabilities differ greatly across regions, scientific development and innovation should address specific needs at regional and local scale, fully acknowledging place-based governance, socio-economic and identity characteristics and other place-based data, with tailor-made responses and measures, which are required for a positive and just societal transformation towards climate resilience. To get the Mission kick-started, this topic is based on a full openness, bottom–up principle. For this call, no thematic focus is pre-defined to leave each proposal define the most relevant climate vulnerabilities and risks to be addressed in the regions involved, for example extreme precipitations events or extreme droughts.
Inter-regional collaborative actions to demonstrate and scale up effective solutions are highly encouraged, where regions front-runners that are most experienced in climate resilience building would collaborate in addressing interregional challenges with regions less experienced that are vulnerable to similar climate impacts, creating a common place to test and deploy the most suitable solutions and to exchange best practices. Proposals should include at least demonstration in three regions where adaptation actions will be deployed to increase the resilience of these regions to the negative effects of climate change. These three minimum regions must be located in different EU Member States or Horizon Europe associated countries, with at least one demonstration taking place in a less developed region [3]. For each of the demonstrators that will take place in front-runner regions, the proposal should support replication of the successful demonstration in at least two more less experienced regions. The consortium may include other type of partners, such as private or public research organisations and enterprises, to ensure that all needed capabilities are available.
The contribution from Horizon Europe budget to projects under this topic is intended to stimulate substantial additional investments from national and European public funding programmes and from private sources. A written commitment to apply for complementary funding is required from the participating regions in which the action proposed will be implemented in case the project will be selected for funding. This should be expressed by a letter of intent annexed to the proposal signed by the corresponding authority/ies from the participating regions. The letter should state the willingness of the Regional authority to seek (when possible) complementary funding from other national and European programmes for investments aiming at increasing resilience and adaptation to climate change. This will include in particular European Regional Development and Cohesion Fund and the Next generation EU.
To unlock / identify links to EU Regional Funds to implement their climate adaptation plans and strategies contributing to a sustainable and inclusive growth, regions involved in the proposals could leverage JRC guidance and support to EU regions and Member States in the development of smart specialisation strategies. In particular, the regions could tap in to JRC support in the development of specific synergetic actions in the area of climate adaptation among Horizon Europe, national research and innovation programmes, cohesion policy programmes and the Next generationEU recovery instrument.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will also consist of supporting the analysis of nature-based solutions (e.g. biodiversity for climate resilience), which are beyond standard quick fixes and need careful evaluation taking into account regional aspects.
In agreement with the authorities responsible for the territories where the actions will be implemented, the consortium should develop a scalability plan including the diffusion of innovative solutions, and a process for commitments (including funding and governance) in adopting large-scale and long-term resilience building. The consortium should seek guarantees for the non-reversibility, sustainability and continuity of the actions after the end of the project.
Proposals should (when relevant) build upon existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, including from beyond EU, designed and developed from previous projects on climate adaptation funded by European and National programmes in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020), as well as Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations, the LIFE programmes and the EIT Climate KIC [4] and support the upscaling of successful pilots.
Proposals should be consistent with the EU actions taken to boost its resilience over the past years and in particular the strategies or plans developed by EU Member States and associated countries.
Projects funded under this topic should aim for clear, discernible results in short- to medium-term, embedding them in a perspective of long-term systemic change. Interventions should result in large impact and visible actions, with a focus on rapid scalability and deployment of effective solutions. While the project duration is expected to be 4-5 years, projects should provide a detailed description of the results that will be in place by the end of the third year and the timeline to exploit the full results. Actions are expected to deliver visible results in- situ by the end of the project. Project progress, including its scalability and exploitation plan, will be monitored continuously by the granting authority on a yearly basis as part of the monitoring process of the Climate Adaptation Mission. The project should also commit to sustain longer term results and to follow up beyond the end of the project duration, through the involvement of the relevant authorities, as climate resilience building at large territorial scale, in particular through large scale nature-based solutions, implies that certain results can only manifest themselves longer term.
Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links with the Climate-ADAPT platform[5] (run by the European Environment Agency (EEA) together with DG CLIMA) that will act as a central element for the monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in European Regions. To this purpose, projects will feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments.
Projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other projects funded under other topics in the Mission Climate Adaptation as well as in other relevant Missions, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Of particular importance in this context are topics HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-01: European Blue Parks and HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-03: Atlantic and Arctic basin lighthouse - restoration of marine ecosystems. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.
The European Commission intends to establish a network and coordination activities amongst all the projects funded for the implementation of the Climate adaptation Mission, and also those funded under the Horizon 2020 European Green Deal call[6] and under Horizon Europe when particularly relevant to climate adaptation knowledge and solutions, and that will be coordinated by the soon to be established Mission Implementation Platform. The projects under this topic will be requested to contribute to this effort. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.

Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Beyond state of the art asset-level models for critical infrastructures will allow for a better assessment of adaptation options
Public authorities will be enabled to compare different adaptation approaches on the basis of a model information system on critical infrastructure
An analysis of gaps in European data regarding the assessment of direct[1] and indirect[2] economic consequences of damages to critical infrastructures.
Scope:
This topic relates to the Mission’s first objective: preparing and planning for climate resilience and the need for a better understanding of climate change related risks.
To fully comprehend climate change related risks, information on assets is necessary. Asset-level modelling requires combining meteorological/hydrological hazard models with information on assets (their location and ideally their construction costs and quality, as well as historical loss data). Assets can be publicly or privately owned infrastructure, including critical infrastructure, as well as natural and land areas or housing areas. This topic addresses the provision of asset-level information to public authorities, on critical infrastructures.
The proposal should consider the effect of multiple hazards (including complex, cascading and compound disasters) and should develop improved assessment models, including improved model coupling. For instance, coupling hazard, exposure and vulnerability, stemming from sources such as Copernicus and its Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)[3], with assessments of impacts and of potential adaptation measures, thereby completely integrating the causal chain from climate stressors to adaptive responses into one unifying modelling framework.
The proposal should consider several critical infrastructures (for example electricity supply, ICT, transport systems) across several regions and how its functioning might be impeded by climate change induced risks. The models developed should include reconstruction costs, the costs of not providing the intended service as well as knock-on effects on other systems. The model should be designed as a decision support tool for public authorities allowing them to assess costs of various adaptation solutions across several regions.
The proposal must demonstrate that it goes beyond state of the art and should identify data gaps and discuss approaches to overcome the data gaps in the future. In particular, the proposal should look at
a) resolution and completeness of data for exposure assessments
b) data on construction costs, construction quality and characteristics (notably protection against extreme weather events) as well as on planned redundancies.
c) data on the use of the infrastructures (for example how many trains, cars or households are served)
The proposals should give due regard to the Commission technical guidance[4] on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027, notably as regards climate resilience, the climate vulnerability and risk assessment, as well as the identification, economic and technical appraisal, and implementation of relevant adaptation measures.

","11 January 2022
","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
An operational, consistent and more advanced multi-risk assessment framework tool across scales and levels of governance that can be used by all regions and communities[1] in Europe, so they are better equipped to develop their climate resilience plans (if not available yet) or improve the ones that might be already existing.
Harmonised multi-hazard/ risk assessments at the regional scale, on which the development or improvement of community-based emergency and risk management plans can be based.
Enhanced adaptive capacity of European regions and communities, reduced vulnerability to climate change, variability and extremes, and strengthened scientific knowledge on climate risk assessment.
Needs for further development of standards, implementation support and guidance for standards (e.g. design maps for climatic actions) are clearly formulated.
Scope:
The proposal should address two distinctive actions, in a sequence indicated below.
1st Action- Development and beta testing of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment framework tool
This topic relates to the Mission’s first objective[2]: preparing and planning for climate resilience and the need for a better understanding of climate change related risks and their interactions with other types of risks.
The total budget for the first action should be 20% of the total requested EU contribution. The multi-risk and multi sector assessment framework tool should be developed for broad application to all European regions and communities. The harmonised framework and the methodology and guidelines to assess the climate change risks and impacts should be designed to be accessed by non-experts users and the relevant stakeholders, with user-friendly features.
The approach proposed should make an efficient use of the currently available high-resolution data and services, in particular, envisaging an exploitation of those provided by Copernicus[3], initiatives within the Group on Earth observation (GEO) and EuroGEO, and the ones of Destination Earth[4], particularly its climate change adaptation digital twin and its way how to involve non-experts. Big data and artificial intelligence should be also integrated in the tool in an innovative way to better quantify and assess climate risks. All developments should take advantage of and where possible align with the JRC Risk Data Hub[5] terminology, indicators, data structure so that newly generated risk, vulnerability and loss data can be integrated in its GIS web platform, as well can be integrated with Destination Earth. The proposal should also work closely with national authorities to ensure the integration of the information, knowledge and experience existing at national and regional level.
While a large amount of data and information is available, there are still significant knowledge gaps when it comes to mid-and long term projections of frequency and severity of extreme events at regional and local level, specific impacts within various types of territories (urban, rural, geographic specificities) and land use, cascading and spill-over effects, and the integration of socio-economic (including vulnerability and the impacts/effectiveness of the adaptation solutions) and in-situ data.
The proposal should provide a benchmark and comparison of the already ongoing climate risk assessment frameworks and identify common ground and gaps to be filled. Basing the results on reputable, quality controlled data such as the one made available by C3S on the Climate ADAPT portal of the European Environment Agency, will be a way to ensure that a common data layer is used by all risk assessment frameworks.
The development of the climate risks and impacts assessment framework tool should be based on the state-of-the-art multi-sector risk framework[6], with its three components (hazard, exposure, vulnerability), considering the rich available experience in the private sector (e.g. insurance) and public institutions (e.g. UNDRR Global Risk Assessment Framework, GRAF[7]) and building upon existing risk assessment frameworks, such as PESETA studies and EEA assessment reports and the Climate-ADAPT’s climate data explorer, relevant CEN/ISO technical standards (e.g. the Eurocodes), and take also into account ongoing work on standardisation of climate and disaster loss data.
The proposed harmonised framework should clearly tap into the wealth of existing national and regional risk assessment strategies and methodologies and should be defined after some consultation and validation with the relevant national and regional stakeholders who are normally in charge of the climate risk assessment processes. The proposal should also identify and support ways by which the framework may be widely applied, supporting the implementation of the EU Adaptation Strategy and possibly also by incorporating it in the guidance and procedures of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), or a combination of both, and exploring the role of the data and knowledge services embedded in the Climate ADAPT platform.
2nd Action- Using the climate risk assessments framework tool in regions and communities, to conduct climate risks, vulnerabilities and impacts assessments as a basis for development or revision of local emergency and risk management plans
The proposal should provide direct financial support in the form of grants to at least 50 regions and communities in conducting multi-hazard/ risk assessment profiles or upgrading and refining existing ones, making use of climate services, using the framework tool developed under Step I. This action should start no later than 12 months after the project kick-off. A close cooperation with pre-established regional networks should be pursued to ensure maximum dissemination and use of the climate risk assessment tool. 60% of the total amount of the EU requested contribution must be made available to provide direct support to regions and communities. To implement the support to financial support to third parties, the consortium should include partners with relevant operational and financial experience and viability.
Through the provision of financial support to third parties, the proposal should provide a number of selected local and regional administrations with access to development of their climate risk profiles, guidance for the development of comprehensive risk management, based on the designed framework and other service oriented initiatives such as Copernicus Climate Change Service C3S, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service and GEO/EuroGEO.
Priority should be given to regions or locations with high vulnerability[8], limited resources and/or low adaptive capacity[9] to climate change impacts. Demand could be higher than what can be supplied within the limits of this action, therefore proposals to this call should include a process and criteria for how to identify the regions and communities most in need of these services. These criteria will ensure that a variety of locations are represented, in as many countries as possible, reflecting the diversity in climatic risks in Europe, as well as differences in socio-economic and demographic conditions, and in approaches to mitigating such risks. Such criteria should also take into account the characteristics of the populations concerned and the vulnerability of the locations. Respective national governments should be consulted in this process selecting the regions and communities.
The proposal should also highlight opportunities for adjustments of existing community early warning systems, where they exist, to consider changing patterns of climate extreme events and ensure rapid responses and the protection of the concerned people, in particular those at high risk such as children, senior citizens, people with chronic diseases and socially disadvantaged groups. It should support local administrations and local businesses (in particular SMEs) to develop or revise community-based emergency and risk management plans to ensure critical infrastructure is safe and essential services operable and accessible under critical conditions and to prepare resilience strategies to minimise the economic impact (e.g. temporary or permanent shutdown) from climate events resulting in further negative impacts for the wider community through loss of income, employment and livelihoods. Citizens and civil society organisations will be encouraged to provide inputs towards the risk assessments.
The proposal should contribute to filling pre-defined knowledge gaps through harmonisation and integration of existing data allowing for generating of trends and effective predictive modelling of extreme events affecting local communities. Furthermore, data enabling characterising vulnerability (population, infrastructure), disaster loss data, adverse impacts of extreme events, or effectiveness of the adaptation solutions shall be integrated in the risk assessment at local level. 20% of the total requested EU contribution should be allocated to the consortium, for maintenance and update of the risk assessment framework tool, back office support to the regions and communities that aim to develop their risk assessment plans and are using the tool, and developing a proposal for scaling up and improving the risk assessment framework tool. During its duration, the project should include an open support line or help desk for all interested European regions and communities, beyond those that will be selected for direct support in conducting their risk assessments through the cascading funds.
The knowledge generated in the course of the project should be broadly disseminated, made open source, and shall be made public (including eventually developed IT tools), free and open licensed, helping citizens, public institutions and businesses to understand and appreciate their risk exposure, possible implications of climate disruptions on social, economic and environmental processes and key community systems, possible business opportunities. Future actions under the Climate Adaptation Mission should leverage the knowledge generated from this action, in providing support to more regions and communities. The generated knowledge and outcomes should also feed into the improved design and development of this harmonised risk assessment framework.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will consist of making the JRC Risk Data Hub available and adapting it as needed for hosting and publishing the disaster loss, vulnerability and risk data that is collected under the mission, as far as it is aligned with its terminology, indicators, and data structure.
The European Commission intends to establish a network and coordination activities amongst all the projects funded for the implementation of the Climate adaptation Mission, and also those funded under the Horizon 2020 European Green Deal call[10] and under Horizon Europe when particularly relevant to climate adaptation knowledge and solutions, that will be coordinated by the soon to be established Mission Implementation Platform. The project that will be selected under this topic will be requested to contribute to this effort. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.

Well established mechanisms to meaningfully involve and engage citizens and stakeholders in the transformation to climate resilience in the regions and communities participating in the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change;
Innovative problem-oriented climate adaptation solutions are co-designed and co-created through solid approaches to engage citizens, civil society, academics, experts, social partners, policy-makers, entrepreneurs and other relevant actors;
Empowerment of citizens in contributing to the Mission in their region and community, including by enabling them to collect and analyse relevant data, to act on reducing the effects of climate change, and by limiting the impact of disinformation campaigns perpetrated to contrast citizens’ engagement for climate resilience;
An enhanced and increased toolbox of innovative mechanisms and approaches of engaging citizens and stakeholders in transformative processes, and a better understanding of their success factors in different cultural, social, political and environmental contexts;
Alliances of high impact, in order to increase the likelihood of long-term sustainability and social acceptability of citizen-led actions in the context of the Mission adaptation.
Scope:
This topic contributes to the three objective of the Mission and correspond to one of the thematic research areas described in the Mission Implementation Plan[1].
With the engagement of citizens and stakeholders at the very heart of the Mission approach, the central aim of this topic is to support regions and communities in the meaningful and effective engagement of citizens and stakeholders in all phases of the Mission and in all steps of the region’s transformational journey to climate resilience.
To ensure this support, proposals should address all of the following aspects:
To provide direct support to the regions and communities sharing relevant state-of-the-art knowledge, best practices and emerging innovations on how best to engage citizens and stakeholders and providing guidance and support regarding the implementation of citizens and stakeholders engagement activities.
To undertake research and test innovative solutions using the citizens and stakeholder engagement activities ongoing in the regions and communities as case studies to better understand their success factors and to explore and experiment with new innovative ways of engaging citizens and stakeholders in transformative processes, and to feed this information back to all regions and communities.
To ensure synergies between the Mission and other relevant initiatives in engaging citizens and stakeholders at local, national, and European level and to share relevant knowledge and experience made in the Mission more broadly.
The proposal should cover a broad range of approaches, mechanisms and initiatives to meaningfully and effectively engage citizens and stakeholders in each step of the transformative journey to climate resilience in both problem framing and solving of the issues at stake, including but not limited to:
The engagement of citizens and stakeholders in the co-production of the assessment of climate impacts and risks; in an inclusive deliberation of the regions’ climate resilient vision and the co-design of plausible futures scenarios for their regions and communities; or the communication strategies that mobilise individuals and collectives into greater civic involvement as needed to trigger transformative change.
The engagement of citizens and stakeholders in the co-design, co-development and co-implementation of innovative solutions to reach climate resilience, for example through citizen science approaches, as a value-adding, cost-effective, responsible and impactful ways to address some of local and regional communities’ and society’s greatest challenges.
The engagement of citizens and stakeholders in the gathering and analysis of relevant data and the monitoring of climate risks, transformational changes and the co-evaluation of the progress of the Mission itself, for example through citizen observatories.
The proposal should use the opportunities offered by the Mission’s endeavour and its activities ongoing in the regions and communities as test bed and should use activities related to local engagement of citizens on climate adaptation across the Mission’s geographical scope as case-studies to:
Understand how best to employ the various approaches and mechanisms to engage citizens and stakeholders in different cultural, social, political and environmental contexts and how participatory practices can be leverage points for more effective policy interventions and research in relation to at least one of the three objectives of the Mission.
Better understand the role and optimal use of citizens and stakeholder engagement in processes of societal transformations such as the transformation to climate resilience envisaged by this Mission.
Test and experiment with innovative approaches and mechanisms of citizens and stakeholder engagement, including the exploration of participatory platforms (such as the one used for the Conference on The Future of Europe) to maintain a continuous debate and co-creation online and hybrid spaces at different geographical scales.
Identify and addressed the market potentials and the critical elements preventing a larger uptake of citizen observations, for example building on the citizen observation roadmap[2] developed through the Horizon 2020 project WeObserve, with concrete policy recommendations on how to tackle these elements.
The proposal should ensure synergies with the many initiatives at local, national and European level for which citizen engagement is an increasingly important cornerstone, in particular where these citizen-led initiatives are related to climate change adaptation. At European level, this includes, among others, initiatives such as the Conference on the Future of Europe, the Climate Pact, Education for Climate Coalition, the European Democracy Action Plan[3], the New European Bauhaus, ESF+, New Skills Agenda, the Biodiversity Strategy 2030 and other Missions, the European Green Deal Call[4] and Horizon Europe Calls for Proposals[5]. In this context the action should, inter alia,
Provide opportunities to build partnerships with and learn from existing participatory and deliberative processes carried out (e.g., Convention Citoyenne pour le climat, the Bürgerrat Klima – Die Ergebnisse, the Antwerp experiment to fight poverty and unemployment while reaching city Climate targets),[6], at national, regional and local levels.
Liaise with previous and on-going projects in the context of citizen observations, for example with WeObserve project and the projects granted under the Horizon 2020 Green Deal call topic 10.3.2.
Cooperate with key stakeholders of the EU strategy to tackle disinformation (i.e. signatories of the Code of Practice on disinformation[7], European Digital Media Observatory[8]) to limit the impact of disinformation campaigns perpetrated to support climate change denial
The proposal should increase citizen empowerment, in contributing to the objectives of Mission Adaptation, by engaging them, supporting them and providing them the opportunities to co-create actions that they can perform, and by ensuring their access to training and customised services in the partner regions. The proposals should contribute to enhance the capacity of citizens and civil society at large, to affect the decision-making process, at different stages of the policy cycle, from data collection to policy design, implementation and evaluation) and in the spirit of the Aarhus Convention[9], as well as to genuinely empower citizenry on local matters of care and concern.
For this, the consortium selected to deliver on this action needs to build strong relationships between the local partners collaboration with national, local and regional authorities, social partners, managing authorities and intermediate bodies of Cohesion Policy, stakeholders of Smart Specialisation Strategies, Commission Representations, Europe Direct Information Centres, EIT Climate-KIC regional offices, Erasmus+ Offices, EU Covenant of Mayors Office, Global Covenant of Mayors.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will consist of analysing the appreciation of ecosystems with corresponding respectful socio-economic behaviour, for which a careful evaluation needs to take into account regional aspects.
The project funded under this topic is strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities with other projects funded under other topics in the Mission Climate Adaptation as well as in other relevant Missions, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Of particular importance in this context is topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-05-03: Piloting citizen science in marine and freshwater domains. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.

","HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions
","11 January 2022
","12 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
In the participating regions and communities:
The pathways to a climate resilient future and their corresponding innovation agendas that regions and communities[1] will have developed as output of this project are used to shape relevant research and innovation strategies, and to mobilise research and innovation actions to develop, test and up-scale systemic solutions increasing local climate resilience as identified.
The pathways to a climate resilient future and their corresponding innovation agendas that regions and communities will have developed as output of this project are reflected in political commitments to prepare the ground for the large-scale diffusion of solutions, including policy actions promoting enabling conditions, addressing barriers and leveraging funds.
The process developing these pathways and innovation agendas to a climate resilient future will have further mobilised and inspired the engagement of citizens, academia, the private sector and other stakeholders, including trough social innovation, in the transformative journey to climate resilience within the regions and communities and beyond.
Within and beyond the participating regions and communities:
The process developing these pathways and innovation agendas to a climate resilient future will have provided a better understanding of cross-border interdependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as led to an increase in inter-regional coordination and collaboration to achieve cross-border climate-resilience and harmonization of the strategies to achieve climate resilience.
The process developing these pathways and innovation agendas to a climate resilient future will have provided a better understanding of how to best structure, facilitate and support the processes of deliberating and co-designing transformative pathways to climate resilience in a wide range of environmental, economic, political and cultural contexts.
The communication and sharing of relevant information and lessons learned will have triggered other regions and communities to also engage in their own processes of deliberating and co-designing transformative pathways to climate resilience.
Scope:
This topic relates to the Mission’s second objective, and aims to have at least 100 regions and communities[2] that will have formulated their vision of a climate resilient future and the transformative adaptation pathways, plans and innovation portfolios to reach it.
This action aims at providing the necessary knowledge, expertise, and services to support regions in the formulation of their climate resilient future and of their place-based transformative adaptation pathways, plans and innovation portfolios.
Regional and local authorities will be in the lead of the process developing their respective pathways towards climate resilience and corresponding innovation agendas. They will be supported (i) by the overall consortium selected under this topic that will provide the general framework and tailored support to selected regions and communities and facilitate the orchestration of activities across regions and communities, and (ii) by a local, regional and /or national partner organisation with experience of working on climate adaptation, including societal transformation, that will be engaged through support to third parties in the for of grants (for minimum 70% of the EU requested contribution and of the maximum amount of EUR 300 000 per region) for each of the participating regions and communities.
The proposal should focus on building capacity of regions and communities to take leadership on their own transformative adaptation pathways. Direct and substantive support and capability building should be provided to the regions and communities, both by the overall consortium and the local partner organisation. The inclusion of a local partner organisation should ensure optimal mobilisation of local/regional/national knowledge, initiatives and stakeholders and build local human resources and organisational capacity to support each region’s transformational change process, developing local capacity with long-term local impact beyond the project duration.
The development of regional pathways towards climate resilience should build on assessments of trends and projections of future climate change risks (which are not to be provided by this project). The pathways, plans and innovation portfolios should reflect the 10 areas of innovation and transformation outlined by the Mission in adequate proportion to their relevance to each region and community, as well as any other area that may be identified as relevant by the respective regions and communities[3]. They should also take account of the priorities identified in the national and regional climate change adaptation strategies and programmes, national Recovery and Resilience Plans, relevant regional smart specialisation strategies established under Cohesion Policy and other programmes, such as the Common Agricultural Policy.
The process developing the pathways should be inclusive and participatory, engaging all relevant stakeholders, including public administrations, private sector, universities, civil society, social partners, and in particular citizens and vulnerable groups. The process should entail:
deliberations on the regions or communities’ vision for climate resilience and
an assessment of the community systems[4] that need to change and of the enabling conditions required to achieve the envisaged transformations,
the analysis, visualisation and deliberation of different possible futures possibly including different solutions and innovations, that are robust and cost-effective across these possible futures.
the elaboration of a set of deliberately designed innovative adaptation solutions/interventions operating at different scales and working on different parts of the system, intended to unlock transformations to greatly strengthened climate resilience. The process should provide, for each region and community, indication of the portfolio of innovations and actions intended, including scenarios, intervention points, and the description of a range of concrete innovations and activities including plans and strategies on how to fund/finance these. The development of these pathways should also take into account the cultural approach and the specific social impediment and opportunity for the design of the pathway to a climate resilient future able to involve citizens and stakeholders and create conditions for political decisions.
When designing these innovation actions and transformative activities, particular attention should be paid to possible synergies with other regional, national or EU programmes and funds or other parts of Horizon Europe. As for possibly relevant EU programmes,funds and initiatives the following are an example of what should be considered:
CAP and LIFE;
the Renovation Wave to ensure that critical and social infrastructure is climate proof;
the European Climate and Health Observatory to foster information exchange and cooperation in preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change on human health;
the ERDF and Cohesion Funds (policy objectives 1 and 2) to promote the transformations of more climate resilient regional economies in the context of smart specialisation strategies, including support from JRC facilitating the Smart Specialisation Strategies Platform;
the Skills Agenda and the European Social Fund (ESF+) to innovate and facilitate the necessary education, training and capacity building to create the needed capacities and skills for a more climate resilient employment;
the Digital Europe Work Programme, in particular its efforts to establish the Green Deal Data Space and the Data Space for Smart Communities, the development of the Destination Earth Digital Twins, and the relevant Testing and Experimentation Facilities to facilitate access to and better management of data and knowledge;
Data and operational climate services, including National Meteorological Services, Copernicus Climate Change , Copernicus Emergency Management, and other relevant Copernicus services, Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe relevant projects, as well as relevant actions, projects and initiatives of and through EuroGEO[5], GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) and the European Space Agency (ESA) programmes;
Horizon Europe instruments, including those of bottom-up nature like the European Research Council or the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and its partnerships (in particular the partnerships on biodiversity, water, and sustainable food systems) and missions (in particular the missions on oceans, smart cities and healthy soils);
other relevant EU, national and or regional programmes and instruments (e.g. Just Transition Fund, Recovery and Resilience Facility, European Structural and Investment Funds, Erasmus+ programme, European Solidarity Corps, Invest EU, Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation programmes and relevant financing by the European Investment Bank).
The support provided by the project should be accessible to as many regions and communities as possible but should support at least 100 regions and communities. Priority should be given to regions or locations with the high vulnerability[6], limited resources and/or low adaptive capacity[7] to climate change impacts. Demand could be higher than what can be supplied within the limits of this action, therefore proposals to this call should include a process and criteria for how to identify the regions and communities most in need of these services. These criteria must ensure that a variety of locations are represented, in as many countries as possible, reflecting the diversity in climatic risks in Europe, as well as differences in socio-economic and demographic conditions, and in approaches to mitigating such risks. Such criteria should also take into account the characteristics of the populations concerned and the vulnerability of the locations. Respective national governments should be consulted in this process selecting the regions and communities.
It is expected that the project will have a duration of about 5 years. The process selecting the regions and communities should start as soon as possible. To allow for flexibility and overall balance, it may be considered to on-board the 100 regions and communities in a distributed manner over the course of the first 3 years. The first set of regions and communities should be fully engaged within 15 months after the start of the project. The time estimated for each region and community to develop their pathway and innovation agenda for the transformation to climate resilience is estimated to be within 18-24 months of having been on-boarded.
Proposals should describe how the consortium would:
Define and implement a common impact framework guiding the work with the regions and communities that is to reflect, among other things, the following
The impact created by implementing each individual element and combinations of elements of the portfolio of innovations and activities.
The impact of working together on portfolio design and on learning, on collaborative ways of working, behaviours and mindsets across diverse stakeholder groups.
The impact of the portfolio of innovations and activities on system dynamics and how to increase the understanding of how to unlock change faster and how to make better quality decisions and to share lessons learned.
Structure and organise the selection of regions and communities and their local partner organisations.
Support the regions and communities in the various steps of the process developing the pathways and innovation agendas, including how it would
provide third party support to them through grants and means to engage local/regional/national partners to support the respective regional and/or local administrations;
help facilitate the engagement of relevant stakeholders and citizens;
ensure the necessary access to relevant information, in particular on the range of possible innovations or solutions;
provide tailor-made analysis, visualisation and deliberation of different possible futures for each participating region and community;
support the composition of portfolios of innovation and activities and an underpinning finance strategy.
Orchestrate cross-regional exchanges to learn from each other, address cross-border interdependencies, and create opportunities for future collaboration.
Undertake continuous efforts to learn from and improve the processes of deliberating and co-designing transformative pathways to climate resilience in a wide range of environmental, economic, political and cultural contexts.
Communicate and share relevant information and lessons learned more broadly, in particular through Climate-ADAPT and the Policy Support Facility to be established under the Covenant of Mayors.
In order to implement the financial support to third parties, the consortium should include partners with relevant operational and financial experience and viability.
The project could leverage JRC support to provide guidance and support to regions and communities in the development of smart specialisation strategies and in identifying links to EU Regional Funds to implement their climate adaptation plans and strategies. In particular, the regions and communities supported under this action could tap in JRC support in the development of specific synergetic actions in the area of climate adaptation among Horizon Europe, national research and innovation programmes, the EU Regional and cohesion policy programmes and the Next generationEU recovery instrument.
The project awarded under this topic should collaborate with on-going Horizon 2020 projects, including those funded through the Green Deal call, in view to tailor a Mission Adaptation portfolio of services addressing the partner regional and local needs. Furthermore, the activities of the projects supported under this topic will have strong complementarities with the activities of the research actions that the Mission will support elsewhere. For this reason, the proposal should collaborate with other projects funded by the Mission.
The European Commission intends to establish a network and coordination activities amongst all the projects funded for the implementation of the Climate adaptation Mission, and also those funded under the Horizon 2020 European Green Deal call[8] and under Horizon Europe when particularly relevant to climate adaptation knowledge and solutions, and that will be coordinated by the soon to be established Mission Implementation Platform. The project that will be selected under this topic will be requested to contribute to this effort. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.
In order to adhere to the FAIR principles, the proposals should consider the possibility to leverage the existing open-data and develop the tailoring procedure on the cloud platforms such as the DIASs or the Copernicus Climate Data Store. Through the Sectoral Information System[9] of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), a large number of examples exist of how climate data could be transformed into user-relevant information for different sectors.

","21 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden” and destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Based on a trusted governance and effective working modalities, research funders, health policy-makers and the research community work together in order to identify and prioritise topics of common interest and European benefit;
Research funders and policy-makers:
support the generation of knowledge related, but not limited, to cardiovascular diseases, diet related diseases and nano medical technologies, and have access to and make use of the evidence on the benefits and drawbacks of health interventions, in particular for optimising clinical management, personalised medicine (coordinating with the future Partnership on Personalised Medicine) and avoiding overtreatment;
overcome the main obstacles to test health interventions at European level. Therefore, the research community, independently from private interest, can conduct large-scale Investigator-Initiated Clinical Studies (IICSs)[1] of various health interventions addressing important public health needs in a seamless way, effectively addressing known challenges related to, for example, appropriate study design, ethics (including special patient groups[2]), regulatory and institutional approvals, patient recruitment, management of informed consent, as well as, bio banking of human samples;
Public health research systems in the ERA are more effective and integrated. Utilization of health services, preventative measures, technologies, tools and digital solutions are more cost-effective;
Health and care authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use the research results to develop evidence-based strategies and policies, and deploy good practices to European countries and regions;
Patients and citizens are more knowledgeable about disease threats and contribute to a patient-centred decision-making process, assuring better adherence to knowledge-based disease management strategies and policies (including for controlling outbreaks and emergencies);
Countries cooperate better and use context-specific knowledge and evidence to make their health and care systems more sustainable and resilient with respect to upcoming needs and crises (Complementary with the Co-Funded Partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems with which strong links will be established).
Scope:
The “ERA for Health” Partnership will be a leading European initiative for the flexible joint programming of health related research and innovation programmes, effectively involving a wide variety of European funding organisations.
This Partnership will be open in particular to public funders of Health research at both national and regional level in the Member States, countries associated to Horizon Europe and to other funders such as philanthropic organisations. Special attention will be placed on engaging with and including many research funders with relatively small budgets.
The Partnership will integrate research and innovation areas covered by previous ERANET co-fund actions, Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs), as well as IICSs. It will be composed of two phases.
Phase 1 will integrate European initiatives selected as most relevant by the partners[3] and initially implement joint calls on nutrition- and lifestyle-related diseases, cardiovascular diseases and nano-medicine. In parallel, it will test the possibility to carry out joint calls for proposals for R&I activities on IICSs. Phase 1 will last for 2 years. After this period, the Horizon Europe Health Programme Committee will decide whether to extend and intensify the focus on IICSs. This decision will be based on objective criteria to be specified in the final proposals. They will only affect the focus area and budget of the partnership, not its existence over the 7 years.
Phase 1 will start by co-creating an accepted and effective governance mechanism to achieve the following objectives:
1. To jointly identify and implement a common good/best practice funding strategy in priority areas of common interest and European benefit to advance health research and develop innovation. Partners will implement jointly calls to be funded each year. These will prioritize areas that are not adequately covered by (or can complement) existing programmes (i.e. Horizon Europe Work Programmes, other existing or planned partnerships and other actions).
2. To define and have a first measure of coordinated investment in Public Health Research for the European Research Area (EU and Associated countries). This entails agreeing towards the end of Phase 1, on (i) boundaries (what is and what is not “Health research”), (ii) a taxonomy (which programmes are in or out) and (iii) a methodology according to the JOREP[4] data, JRC and EUROSTAT standards for measuring the baseline of this Key Performance Indicator.
3. To develop new approaches that overcome known bottlenecks and challenges to implement multinational IICS. This will be achieved in close collaboration with ongoing initiatives[5] to support the conduct of multinational non-commercial studies. This would result in establishing appropriate mechanism(s) to identify topics, pool-funding sources, and to launch (joint) calls for EU wide multinational IICSs on various health interventions[6] addressing important public health needs.
By the end of Phase 1, all necessary procedures and support should be operational to launch a first call for IICSs involving several countries on selected health interventions that address important public health needs.
During Phase 2, additional multinational calls for IICSs and joint calls for other priority areas will be launched in accordance with the decision of the Health Programme Committee taken at the end of Phase 1 on the focus of the Partnership and the distribution of the budget between IICSs and other areas.
The Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) 536/2014 will become applicable in January 2022. The overall aim of the new Regulation is to make Europe more attractive for clinical trials. With these changes, the Regulation intends to provide additional support to multinational trials. As a new concept, it also introduces low-interventional trials (e.g. pragmatic trials to optimise treatment) with risk-proportionate regulatory requirements. This type of trials can also be supported by actions of this partnership.
The continuously growing arsenal of health interventions, whether it is a new pharmaceutical product, a medical device, a surgical intervention, or other measures utilised during health and care provision, reflecting the increasing demand for better quality of care by citizens, force decision makers of public health systems to optimally allocate limited resources in a well-informed manner. Large-scale IICSs generate data on safety and effectiveness of a health intervention, often in real-world settings, and thus provide evidence to answer questions that clinicians face in their day-to-day practice in order to optimise the clinical management of patients beyond the context of marketing authorisation application for medicinal products. Such studies deal with potential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that do not attract, or could go counter commercial interest. These clinical studies are critical to support endorsement of healthcare strategies (repurposing, comparative effectiveness, treatment combination or optimisation studies, personalised medicine trials).
By pooling existing resources, eliminating redundancies and reducing fragmentation, the implementation of multinational IICSs covered by this Partnership will benefit from better access to high number of study participants/patients, medical expertise and facilities, enhanced methodological standards; and shared costs, tools and procedures. All these aspects will contribute to generate robust and reliable clinical evidence, increase the potential for broad implementation of research outcomes; prevent duplication of research efforts and allow broad uptake by health systems.
IICSs supported by this partnership should i) establish new indications of a given existing health intervention for a condition where alternative solutions do not exist or are sub-optimal; ii) optimise or develop new, personalised care pathways including for high-priced medical interventions/treatment modalities; iii) introduce new health interventions with clear relative clinical efficacy/effectiveness compared to existing alternatives (including preventative measures); iv) accelerate the uptake of new interventions by health care systems.
Support by European research infrastructures, required to perform multinational clinical studies at scale, will, in particular, build on the asset of existing research infrastructures, such as the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN)[7] for sponsor-delegated study responsibilities, and Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI)[8] for the management of biosamples and linked data that are generated under the studies.
The partnership should bring together a broad range of actors with a common vision of future. Through the objectives of Horizon Europe, the partnership should contribute to achieving the following European Commission priorities:
Promoting our European way of life
An economy that works for people
A Europe fit for the digital age
The Partnership should contribute to priorities of the “Communication on effective, accessible and resilient health systems” (COM(2014) 215 final), the “Communication on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market; empowering citizens and building a healthier society” (COM(2018) 233 final) and support the objectives of the Commission proposal for the new EU4Health Programme (COM(2020) 405 final).
This partnership should also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe[9], in terms of fulfilling unmet medical needs and ensuring that the benefits of innovation reach patients in the EU.
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, health and care institutions, innovators, policy makers), to create a critical mass of resources and to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), the partnership will address the following objectives:
Improve the utilisation of existing health technologies in clinical practice
Support research in relevant medical fields and intervention areas (prevention, diagnosis, treatment)
Implement and develop Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI) in multiple ways (in partnership operationalization, in calls and in project evaluation and monitoring)
Engage society through citizens and patients
Promote formal and informal science education
Ensure gender equality, in both the research process and research content
Provide support and build capacity, in particular in conducting IICSs at European scale
Promote open access and data sharing[10]
Communicate and disseminate research outcomes, in particular to decision makers
This Partnership should be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from research to coordination and networking activities, including training, demonstration, piloting and dissemination activities, to be structured along the following main building blocks:
Joint implementation of the SRIA;
Joint annual calls for R&I activities;
Framework to overcome challenges in conducting IICSs
Capacity building activities;
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to those countries wishing to join. The Partnership should include or engage with the following actors:
Ministries in charge of R&I policy, as well as national and regional R&I and technology funding agencies and foundations;
Ministries in charge of health and care policy, as well as national and regional health and care authorities, organisations and providers.
The Partnership may also encourage engagement with other relevant Ministries and research funders. It will involve other key actors from civil society and end-users, research and innovation community, innovation owners, health and care systems owners/organisers and health and care agencies.
The Partnership’s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should involve key stakeholders, including but not limited to the research and innovation community, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care organisations, and innovation owners.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other Horizon Europe partnerships (institutionalized and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on ‘Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe’[11] as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health[12], the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL)[13], the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+)[14], the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)[15], InvestEU[16], the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)[17] and the Technical Support Instrument (TSI)[18].
Cooperation with international organisations, and non-European institutions and experts may be considered. Participation of third countries is encouraged. Their commitments to the Partnership would not be eligible for the calculation of EU funding. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
International research funders are supported by a dynamic and efficient secretariat in their coordination efforts for a rapid research response when a pandemic or a severe epidemic strikes.
International research funders can rely on a tested framework underpinning a rapid and effective research response, and as such ensure stronger research preparedness and response for public health emergencies, including in cross-cutting areas such as data sharing, social science, clinical trial networks and others.
Research funders, policy makers and the research community are well informed of the activities of GloPID-R members, both as a group and individually.
Scope:
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a confronting reality-check of the potential extent of threats posed by new or emerging infectious diseases. The pandemic overwhelmingly confirmed that to fight such international challenges, global collaboration and coordination is crucial. The Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R)[1] was established in 2013 for this reason, in response to a request for coordination by the Heads of International Research Organisations. Years on, GloPID-R now provides a widely recognised platform for infectious disease research funders to work together to better tackle severe epidemics such as Ebola or Zika, as well as global pandemics such as COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic response illustrated the value added by GloPID-R, by enabling coordination between funders and with relevant global actors such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI); or by promoting exchanges and synergies between funded researchers. Ongoing efforts with the network include reflections on improved data sharing during outbreaks, creating links between clinical trial networks, addressing specificities of research in low and middle-income countries, and the inclusion of social sciences into the research response to public health emergencies.
Proposals should foresee administrative and technical support through a secretariat to maintain, but above all to support GloPID-R’s continuous evolution for an optimal value added.
Proposals are expected to cover all of the following activities:
Provide administrative and organisational support to the Chair and Vice Chairs of GloPID-R, in close collaboration with the European Commission;
Provide strong scientific support on topics requested by the GloPID-R Chairs, scientific advisors or (working) groups;
Facilitate the work of the scientific advisors, ISG and GloPID-R working groups, using earlier experience in research preparedness and response to infectious disease outbreaks;
Manage information dissemination and communication between the Chairs, Members, Scientific Advisors, Industry Stakeholder Group (ISG), working groups, enquiries, and outside stakeholders;
Reinforce GloPID-R’s external communications activities, such as the website and newsletter, as requested by the Chairs;
Submit an annual work plan to the Commission each year following the annual meeting of GloPID-R, taking into account the conclusions of the annual meeting.
Ensure a high level of adaptability to respond to rapidly evolving situations, following the guidance of the Chairs of GloPID-R.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
Health care practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and those in high-income countries (HICs) serving vulnerable populations have access to and use specific guidelines to implement prevention interventions able to support adolescents and young people to decrease future risks of developing NCDs.
Public health managers and authorities have access to improved insights and evidences on the NCDs related to behaviours and conditions in youth and adolescence. They establish improved health policies to diminish these risks, including to facilitate the deployment of effective public health interventions.
Researchers, clinicians and authorities have an improved understanding of the factors that influence the implementation of preventive actions that address risk behaviours in youth and adolescence.
Communities and local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up health interventions and thus contribute to deliver better health.
Scope:
The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD), an alliance of international funding agencies representing over 80% of the world’s public health research funding and the first collaboration of its kind to specifically address non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The GACD supports implementation science to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members funding agencies and aligned with the GACD call 2021.
The topic is focused on implementation research about common risk prevention interventions targeting adolescents and youth to reduce the impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and vulnerable populations in high-income countries (HICs). Proposals should focus on implementation science around evidence-based interventions that promote healthy behaviours, and that have the potential to profoundly reduce the risk of chronic diseases and multimorbidity.
The GACD Alliance is particularly interested in funding projects that focus on interventions that reduce health risk and/or enhance a healthy lifestyle in young people, which the WHO defines as the period from ages 10-24 and includes adolescence (ages 10-19) and youth (15-24). Adolescence and youth mark a period of emerging independence and an important time for laying the foundations of good health. Adolescence and youth is a period in life where patterns of behaviour are established around diet, physical activity, substance use and sexual activity, which can affect their health in the present; in their future adult lives; and even in the next generation. In the transition from childhood to adulthood, young people become increasingly exposed to harmful products such as tobacco, alcohol and drugs, and can experience devastating mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, self-harm, substance abuse and addictions, as well as eating disorders and suicide. Over 150 million young people smoke; 81% adolescents do not meet physical activity guidelines; 11.7% of adolescents partake in heavy episodic drinking; and suicide has emerged as a leading cause of death in young people globally.
All proposals must make the case for why their selected life stage is a critical period for the reduction of NCD risk in the communities where the research will be undertaken. There are a range of evidence-based interventions, including the WHO Best Buys, which aim to reduce the health risks associated with common NCD risk factors. Implementation research is necessary to understand the uptake, accessibility, acceptability, adaption, sustainability and costs of known interventions for use in young adults and adolescents. Applicants are invited to consider interventions at the individual, family, community (e.g., work or school) or population level. Multi-sectoral approaches and a combination of different types of interventions, including biomedical, digital (such as artificial intelligence and big data), socio-behavioural, and/or structural[1] are encouraged. Projects will be expected to build on evidence-based interventions that focus on prevention interventions and strategies that reduce common risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases, or that promote healthy behaviours. Such interventions/strategies might include, but are not limited to, those in the following three areas: nutrition, physical activity, and/or sleep; tobacco, substance abuse and/or alcohol use; social wellbeing and loneliness . Proposals should be gender-responsive and consider socioeconomic, racial or other factors that relate to equitable impacts of the intervention or barriers to equitable implementation.
Proposals should include implementation research outcomes (e.g. feasibility, fidelity and/or adaptation, spread and/or penetration, acceptability, sustainability, uptake, and cost effectiveness) and where relevant, include service outcomes (e.g. efficiency, safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness). The aim is to harmonise the research common goals and the outcomes assessment of GACD-funded projects in order to maximise the potential for learning across the network and the impact of the initiative as a whole. To this end, all funded teams are expected to use explicit indicators and measures of project context, reach, outcomes evaluation and scale-up potential in their plans and protocols. In this topic, the use of the following measures is encouraged: evidence of uptake of promoted healthy behaviours; evidence of reduction in harmful behaviours; and proxy mental and/or physical health outcomes, if appropriate (pre- and post- intervention PHQ-9 scores, blood pressure, HbA1C, etc.).
Proposals should include a strategy to include policy makers and local authorities, as well as other relevant stakeholders such as community groups. Such engagement should inform the conception and development of the project and should continue throughout the duration of project and afterwards during the knowledge translation phase. Participants that are local stakeholders can be powerful assets to the projects indeed. Their contributions should be nurtured through meaningful engagement throughout all phases of the project, not only as participants in the research undertaken.

Societal Engagement
[1]Structural interventions are defined as interventions that attempt to change the social, physical, economic, or political environments in order to improve health behaviours and outcomes, altering the larger social context by which health disparities emerge and persist. They can include policy-driven fiscal or legislative changes focused on social and/or commercial determinants of health."

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:
The scientific community has better understanding of the biology of the pathogens (virus, bacteria etc.), its transmission, its interaction with humans, animals and plants, in particular in view of emerging threats to human health, such as infectious diseases and anti-microbial resistance.
Health care providers and practitioners have access to and use appropriate medical countermeasures, e.g. vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and digital solutions.
Health authorities have the evidence-base and tools for better public health measures.
Scope:
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed weaknesses in the ability of the Union and its Member States to respond quickly and effectively to such an unprecedented health emergency. Therefore, the Commission is stepping up its efforts in supporting the Union’s ability to respond to serious cross-border threats.
Member States agreed to step up their coordination in the area of pandemic preparedness research and aim to establish a European partnership on pandemic preparedness. A dedicated coordination support action[1] will help develop a common long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for such a partnership.
A key component for the European Health Union will be the establishment of the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) for which the Commission will put forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2021. It should build on experiences dealing with COVID-19, SARS and influenza, and consider emerging biological threats to human health, e.g. in the context of climate change, deforestation and biodiversity loss.
This topic aims to contribute and complement both of these initiatives, notably by addressing priority research and innovation gaps also identified by Member States and that would contribute and support the establishment and work of a potential future Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
Research focussing on ‘pathogen X’ from threat assessment, horizon scanning for the identification of potential medical countermeasures and innovative technologies, including the development of standardised research protocols would be in the scope of this topic.

","12 January 2022
","22 March 2022","Objective:
The objective of this call is to support the deployment of strategic networks as part of the Digital Global Gateway Strategy of the EU, contributing to strengthen the quality of connectivity within the Union as well as with third countries. The deployment may include submarine cables systems, satellite infrastructures and connectivity to internet exchange points under this call.
By supporting the targeted deployment of such connectivity, CEF Digital will have a positive impact not only on strengthening the connectivity capacity, but also on stimulating commercial offers of connectivity.
Access to backbone connectivity in EU Member States differs significantly. In certain regions lack of adequate backbone connectivity may have an impact on the development and service provided by access networks and contribute to generate imbalances in the prices of services, both for network operators in these regions, as well as for their inhabitants.
In particular the connectivity situation for Member States that are themselves islands and/or have islands as part of their territory differs significantly from other Member States. For remote territories such as islands, Outermost Regions and Overseas Countries and Territories, the commercial prices and other conditions of backbone connectivity may hinder the full participation of citizens and enterprises in the digital European economy.
In such areas, market forces alone may not provide answers to all of these challenges. As a result, certain areas may remain underserved or experiment higher prices in terms of access to backbone connectivity.
Scope:
This topic will support the deployment of backbone connectivity for routes within Member States, between Member States, and between the EU and third countries, including to remote territories:
(1) where there is a lack of redundancy on a route. This is typically the case of routes which are not served by at least two present or credibly planned backbone infrastructures; or
(2) where existing or credibly planned backbone infrastructure cannot satisfy the demand, taking into account if necessary any increase in the demand linked to ongoing or credibly planned investments in the upgrade of access networks in the territories concerned. The level of use of existing capacity as well as the expected life of backbone networks are among the elements that can be taken into account to justify such a market failure; or
(3) where despite the presence of a backbone infrastructure providing sufficient capacity and guaranteeing the necessary redundancy, in the absence of credible plans from alternative operators to enter the market, the users in the served territories suffer (or could suffer in the absence of adequate regulatory remedies) from suboptimal services or prices compared to those offered in more competitive but otherwise comparable areas or routes. This could be the case for instance if the backbone infrastructure or a substantial part of it is in the hands of an operator which according to a competent national regulatory authority has market power in the form of a significant market position in the relevant market.
CEF Digital will not support projects that concern routes served already by at least two present or credibly planned submarine cables, as it is presumed that redundancy is addressed by the two infrastructures. Only in projects concerning territories (e.g. small islands or territories with limited population density) where backbone connectivity needs can be served using satellite infrastructure, will the presence of such infrastructure be taken into account when assessing the lack of redundancy.
In case of co-funding from national funds (including Cohesion Funds and the RRF) State aid rules apply (see section 10 of the Work Programme for details).
Proposals under this topic shall address works, with the possibility to include studies:
• For Works, the total project costs required to construct and deliver the described networking solution for the foreseen system lifetime, from end to end, including cable landing stations and the connectivity towards them will be covered under this call. In the case of satellite backbone solutions, only the costs linked to the construction of satellite ground stations and their interconnection with local networks are within the scope of the call. Any costs for operating the infrastructure during its lifetime and extra components at the landing sites not required for the basic end-to-end connectivity such as data centres, hosting facilities and other services will be excluded under the call.
• For Studies, all preparatory work required prior to signing a contract with a supplier, such as marine ground surveys for submarine cables and application for required permits, will be covered under this call.
The evaluation of proposals shall prioritise those offering the higher level of wholesale access to third parties. Proposals must therefore include a description of whether or how they intend to provide wholesale access to third parties. Amongst others, this description may indicate the range of access products, the duration of the access, the method to determine access prices and the business model implemented (wholesale only or others). These elements will be taken into account in the evaluation of the proposal, in particular to assess its expected impact on competition.
Beneficiaries can take the form of consortia, including (local) operators, utilities, (local) authorities, investors and vendors.
All proposals must describe the ownership of the supported infrastructure after completion of the project and describe the mechanism that will be used to provide services, including business models. In particular, any arrangements foreseen to guarantee the provision of services on a non-discriminatory basis to access seekers, as well as the operational relationship(s) between the different participants in the value chain for providing services should be elaborated in the proposal.
Proposals funded under this topic may include synergetic (ancillary) elements relating to another sector of the CEF programme, i.e. energy and transport, if these synergetic elements allow to significantly improve the socio-economic, climate or environmental benefits of the action. CEF co-funding may be provided as long as the cost of these synergetic elements does not exceed 20% of the total eligible costs of the action.
Please consult the Call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.
Expected Impact:
The expected benefits go beyond those directly related to supported projects and contribute to bridging the digital divide and ensuring widespread access to Gigabit networks for all EU citizens and businesses. Moreover, this connectivity infrastructure can cross-facilitate the implementation of other topics supported under CEF Digital, such as the availability of HPC-related facilities, etc.
Key performance indicators for this topic will include: i) the total length of the backbone or (for wireless solutions) the distance between transmission/reception stations, and ii) the additional (significant) transmission capacity created as a result of the projects supported by CEF. For submarine cables the number of fibre pairs, the current capacity per fibre pair, as well as the technology chosen and whether the system is repeated or unrepeated should be mentioned in the proposal, too."

Beneficiaries can be (local) operators, utilities, (local) authorities, investors and vendors, or consortia of the before mentioned groups.
The proposals under this topic are subject to strict exclusion of non-EU controlled entities, under the Article 11.4 of the CEF Regulation. The assessment of the foreign (non-EU) control will be addressed during the eligibility phase of the evaluation of proposals. Participants will be requested to submit an ownership control questionnaire for this purpose to determine their control status. They will also be requested to submit supporting documents in order for the Commission to determine that the entities are not controlled by a third country. Concerning infrastructures connecting the EU with third countries, legal entities established in third countries should exceptionally be eligible to receive Union financial support under the CEF where this is indispensable for the achievement of the objectives of a given project of common interest and conditional on submitting a declaration, approved by the connected third country, providing guarantees that certify that the involved legal entity:
a) Exercises full control over its corporate structure and decision-making process in a manner that does not restrain or restrict in any way its ability to perform and complete the action and is not subject to foreign jurisdiction obligations that may undermine the security of the Union;
b) Effectively prevents access by non-eligible third countries or by non-eligible third country entities to classified and non-classified sensitive information relating to the action;
c) Ensures that the results of the CEF funded action shall remain within the beneficiary/beneficiaries and shall not be subject to control or restrictions by the exceptionally eligible third countries, or other non-eligible third country entities during the action, and for a justified period after its completion (typically the expected lifetime of the infrastructure), as defined in these call conditions.

","22 March 2022","Objective:
Operational digital platforms (including this CSA), as one of CEF Digital Synergy actions, aim to support EU environmental and energy targets, by providing both technologies and connectivity to enable a cyber-secure Internet of Energy and an optimised transport system along the major European paths, as per the 5G objectives in the Gigabit Society Communication and in the Directive on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks (2014/61/EU). This will optimise energy use of ICT and reduce the environmental impact, while increasing the benefits enabled by ICT.
This topic will be funded on the basis of the eligible “actions implementing digital connectivity infrastructure requirements related to cross-border projects in the areas of transport or energy and/or supporting operational digital platforms directly associated to transport or energy infrastructures” (Article 8.4(e) and Article 9.4(e)).
It will be dedicated to “retro-fitting” the existing energy and/or transport infrastructures with the required cross-border digital infrastructure. Operational digital platforms will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures, in particular those supported in other parts of CEF Digital, the Digital Europe Programme, and Horizon Europe.
Scope:
This CSA will prepare the future works project(s) by identifying the most appropriate cases to be funded and by delivering the building blocks (such as governance, detailed design, etc.) needed for immediate deployment of the cross-border infrastructure within the works project(s). It will consist of four stages and it should last 27 months. These four stages include:
Exploratory study to prepare the baseline and identify and shortlist lead use cases in energy, mobility and cross-sector energy/mobility (5 months);
Feasibility study for the shortlisted cases (7 months);
Detailed preparations for the shortlisted cases (9 months); and
Assistance to projects coming from the first call for works (6 months).
Under guidance of the Commission (The Directorates-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (co-ordination), for Energy and for Mobility and Transport), the successful applicants will co-operate closely with the relevant national and EU authorities, as well as associations and multipliers across the relevant sectors.
The first stage will consist of an exploratory study and will last 5 months. It will provide the following outcomes:
Define the needs in digitalising the cross-border energy and/or transport infrastructure between Member States
Identify criteria and recommendations for selecting appropriate and most credible, within standard constraints (e.g. of budget, timing, complementarity to emerging European infrastructures in the targeted sectors), lead use cases and potential project(s), (i.e. the most mature and realistic, with the highest degree of market failure, the most impactful, etc.)
Identify relevant technologies, architectures and standards
Identify relevant stakeholders
Identify possible governance options
Develop the design principles and architecture for connecting the ODPs to the 5G infrastructures along transport corridors and smart communities; the emerging dataspaces in particular in the energy, mobility and related sectors; and the federation of European Cloud and edge services. In that context, the tenderers will collaborate closely with the Co-ordination and Support Actions and implementation projects supported under CEF Digital and Digital Europe Programmes
Identify at least 10 lead cases involving at least 9 member states (and preferably at least 12) in energy, mobility and cross-sector energy/mobility
Shortlist six cases, based on the criteria and recommendations identified earlier, while trying to maintain at least relative balance between energy, mobility and combined projects (priority given to combined projects).
The second stage will consist of a feasibility study for the six shortlisted cases from the first stage and it will last 7 months. It will deliver the following outcomes:
For each case, create a high-level description, solution architecture and governance scheme
Based on these, create a cost-benefits analysis
Define the feasibility of each proposal i.e. how realistic is each case within the constraints
Shortlist three proposals, which are feasible and with the best cost-benefits outcome. For cases with similar characteristics, priority should be given to cross-sector cases between energy and mobility
Prepare a draft for the call text for the works call to be handed over to the Commission.
The third stage will consist of the detailed preparations for the three shortlisted cases from the second stage and it will last 9 months. It will deliver, to the extent possible, the following outcomes:
Create detailed design/architecture for each of the cases
Define key performance indicators for each of the cases
Create detailed governance scheme and get feed-back and buy-in from the identified stakeholders
Set up governance bodies with the most relevant stakeholders and have a governance agreement signed for each of the three cases
Prepare procurement templates and framework agreements
Prepare purchasing orders for potential suppliers for the final deployment including integration and SLAs
Deploy testing environment from willing suppliers and test the solution
Deploy pilot solutions from willing suppliers involving at least 2 and preferably 3 member states and pilot the solution
The fourth and final stage will provide the assistance to the works projects and it, will last six months. This phase will run in parallel with the first six months of the works project(s) and it will serve to transfer the outcomes to the work project(s) and to assist them in the start of implementation. It will consist of the following tasks:
Transfer all documentation and know-how
Fine-tune the documentation according to the works project reality
Prepare recommendations for future work
It is expected that the proposal is submitted by a consortium made up of representatives or participants well balanced across the relevant stakeholder groups and covering the three CEF sectors i.e. digital, transport and energy. In case the consortium does not have enough participants to provide the required balanced representation then these participants should be neutral i.e. in that case they should have no self-interest in a particular outcome of the CSA. Some third parties could be subcontracted for the purpose of building an advisory group, attracting additional expertise from outside the consortium, participation in governance bodies, preparation of the works, etc.
The governance body for the emerging infrastructure should be set up by the CSA (and described in the proposal), and include several entities of each major category of stakeholders, including in particular representatives involved in the long term operations of the infrastructure such as energy companies, data centre operators, transport, telecom and/or platform operators, public authorities, etc. It shall be open to new members and in particular foresee eventual participation by all Member States. It could leverage existing structures as long as this does not counter the interest of participating stakeholders.
The governance body will be responsible for defining ownership of the ODP, at any given time, based on the size of the infrastructure and operations as well as the number of parties involved. The Commission shall not be a member of the body, but shall be granted an observer role. Subject to approval by the Commission, the governance body shall propose a legal and financial framework for the operational and financial details of the infrastructure and services support. Provisions for open and fair access to the infrastructure shall be made, including related to new entities joining at a later stage.
Please consult the Call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.
Expected Impact:
This CSA will identify and prepare for deployment cross-border digital infrastructure that will accelerate the digitalisation of the energy/mobility sector by enhancing interoperability and standardisation and trigger a public-private partnership virtuous circle of investment. This infrastructure will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures.
The resulting works projects will lead to substantial reduction in GHG and improvement in the energy and environmental performance of the European digital infrastructure."

","22 March 2022","Objective:
The main objective of this CSA is to accelerate the development of edge computing solutions as part of 5G corridors and 5G local communities and to ensure an integrated approach with the development of European federated cloud and edge infrastructures funded under CEF Digital and Digital Europe.
The objective is to develop - in cooperation with different stakeholder communities and various ongoing projects in the relevant deployment programmes - concepts and facilities for: (1) the interconnection of newly deployed 5G corridor sections and 5G infrastructure for local communities with edge computing facilities and federated cloud infrastructures; (2) relevant operational service platforms that enable the provision of CAM and commercial 5G connectivity services; and (3) the support of services of general interest in local communities.
Furthermore, the objective is to accompany CEF-funded 5G deployment projects during their edge node deployment and service platform integration phase in order to adopt the common concepts developed.
Scope:
The CSA should gather and consolidate information on the various planned actions under European and national programmes as well as the main private sector initiatives in the field and raise awareness to the stakeholders involved in the various relevant ongoing or future projects.
Based on this information it should – in close cooperation with stakeholders - deliver principles and network architecture concepts for connecting 5G infrastructures along transport corridors and 5G local communities to the edge node and federated cloud infrastructure with the aims (i) to meet service requirements for connected and automated mobility, in particular the stringent requirements for road safety and digital train operations, (ii) and to generate economic efficiencies, whereby the overall 5G-edge-cloud platform would serve the vertical needs of various communities and sectors, in particular mobility and socio-economic drivers.
Once the concepts are agreed, the CSA should accompany the ongoing CEF-funded 5G Corridor and Community projects to deploy and integrate the solutions in the later phase of these deployment projects.
The CSA should also monitor and report on the planned, ongoing and completed deployment of edge nodes with these projects and facilitate reporting in the European 5G Observatory.
The following activities are in the scope of this CSA:
Desk research and stakeholder outreach to gather and report on comprehensive information on ongoing relevant activities in the area of European federated cloud infrastructures.
Identification and definition of use cases in the areas of connected and automated mobility and 5G communities covering several sectors whose provision will be enabled by integrated 5G-edge-cloud infrastructure.
Gather requirements for business continuity across the border meeting CAM service requirements.
Definition of functional and operational network architectures enabling the provision of the selected use cases and building on European federated cloud infrastructures and other relevant initiatives.
Proof of concept, tests and pilots in cooperation with selected CEF-funded 5G deployment projects
Outreach, engagement and advisory services for 5G Corridor (all ongoing CEF-funded projects) and Community (at least 10 CEF-funded projects) to integrate the developed solutions.
For all the proposals submitted under this topic, to be eligible, all participating legal entities must provide security guarantees approved by the Member State in which they are established, on the basis of national law. The approval can be provided in the context of Art 11.6 of the CEF Regulation 2021/1153.
These guarantees will certify that the legal entity:
a) Exercises full control over its corporate structure and decision-making process in a manner that does not restrain or restrict in any way its ability to perform and complete the action and is not subject to foreign jurisdiction obligations that may
undermine the security of the Union;
b) Effectively prevents access by non-eligible third countries or by non-eligible third country entities to classified and non-classified sensitive information relating to the action; and
c) Ensures that the results of the CEF funded action shall remain within the beneficiary/beneficiaries and shall not be subject to control or restrictions by non-eligible third countries or other non-eligible third country entities during the action and for a specified period after its completion, as defined in this call conditions.
Expected Impact:
The CSA is expected to enable new synergies across the digital value chain, in particular the integration of 5G and Gigabit network deployment with cloud-to-edge solutions, and help creating new and innovative business models for the European telecom and IT sectors, as well as vertical sectors including automotive, rail, transport and logistics, as well as for local communities."

","12 January 2022
","22 March 2022","Objective:
As of 2021, there were no operational 5G corridors in Europe. However, large-scale trials for testing, demonstration, and validation purposes have been conducted at different locations across Europe, with the support of European and national/local public funding.
As such, inception studies will be funded under this call in order to prepare the actual deployment work of the first big wave of deployment to be launched after the conclusion of the studies; the relevant call is currently planned for 2023. One study for several deployment projects for the same or different calls, e.g. combined by region, are encouraged. These inception studies should include detailed network planning, which should provide a basis for the deployment plan, concrete deliverables in terms of deployed infrastructure, coverage and service capabilities, utilization of existing infrastructure (fibre, power, ground space etc.), associated costs as well as the assessment of market failure for each relevant action.
Should projects for complementary sections in the same region be under preparation for CEF, RRF or other national programmes, these should be combined in one inception study in order to ensure synergies and complementarity.
In parallel to this call, the Commission is launching a Coordination and Support Action (CSA), which aims at achieving 5G edge cloud integration and thus support and provide assistance in this area.
Scope:
This topic targets preparatory actions for envisaged deployment projects that support investments in challenging areas, where market forces alone will not deliver 5G services with the necessary quality of service, and focus on key European transport paths, including but not limited to, the indicative list of 5G corridors in the Annex part V of the CEF Regulation 2021/1153. The priority for this call will be to support investment in cross-border sections involving two or more Member States, but additional sections considered relevant from a European perspective are equally in the scope of this call.
The corridor that is subject to the study must cross at least one border between two Member States. The length of the corridors envisaged for deployment or study on both/all sides of the border may vary, depending on national circumstances including means of transport, geographic situation and maximum size of the project/EU funding.
Cross-border sections that are complementary to national 5G corridor sections already planned for deployment by the private sector or identified under RRF or other national programmes in line with state aid rules are particularly encouraged in view of their additional potential impact at an early stage.
The studies should provide the following elements:
Exact location of the corridor, including the different cross-border sections.
Detailed definition of service requirements along the corridor allowing for business continuity across borders.
Full network planning including the spectrum bands used.
Concrete deliverables enabling to specify and financially quantify the investment required for infrastructure deployment, including coverage and service capabilities, use of existing infrastructure (backhauling including fibre, power, buildings and other constructions for co-location, ground space and other associated facilities and services).
Coordination mechanisms to ensure business continuity across the border, in particular regarding spectrum management and numbering. This includes a description of the scenario(s) and processes to guarantee a network hand-over meeting targeted CAM service requirements.
Cost calculation and a cost-benefit analysis to identify economically viable and non-viable sections of the corridor where CEF-funding of 5G connectivity infrastructure deployment would be needed and justified according to the guidance set forth by the Commission in its Work Programme.
Timeline of the work plan (finalisation of network planning, permit requests, preparation of works, works, testing, service launch).
Network upgrade plans according to an evolutionary path enabling a densification of radio networks that would allow moving towards higher levels of automation, if possible up to full automation (e.g. level 5 in automotive).
Definition of the cooperation model(s) between the different members of the consortium outlining the roles and responsibilities of each involved party in the deployment project, including financing, ownership, infrastructure deployment, network sharing agreements – if any, network operations and commercial service provision.
Definition of the processes enabling coordination and synergies between funding of works under CEF Digital 2021-2023 and RRF where appropriate, as well as in combination with any other relevant public funding programmes at EU, national and regional/local levels that could be used for the purposes of this first phase of deployment work or subsequent projects.
Identification of financing solutions for subsequent phases (based on the roadmap described above) possibly using a mix of grants and loans, e.g. under the CEF Digital blending facility.
The corridors that are subject to the study should meet the following requirements:
The infrastructure under study should deliver uninterrupted coverage over the whole range of the corridor section thus ensuring high-quality connectivity - depending on the expected traffic demand along the different parts of the section - suitable to provide a broad range of 5G and, where appropriate (i.e. focusing on hotspots e.g. traffic junctions, roadworks, etc.), complementary safety-related services based on existing direct short range communication technologies, such as 4G LTE-V2X and ITS-G5, compatible with existing deployment and supporting complementarity between existing and future infrastructure deployments.
The corridor under the study should be capable of meeting service requirements for both safety-related road/rail/waterway operations (e.g. Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Future Rail Mobile Communication System (FRMCS), River Information Services (RIS)) and multi-service/multi-application 5G services and ensure business continuity across the entire section of the corridor, including in a cross-border environment. The infrastructure can be used for services beyond the transport paths under certain conditions, e.g. in areas surrounding the corridor including populated areas or socio-economic drivers where market failure is demonstrated, without causing undue competition distortions or crowding out effects and provided third party open wholesale access under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory condition is provided.
The infrastructure under study should make use of at least one 5G pioneer band (700 MHz, 3.6 GHz, 26 GHz) and if appropriate the 5.9 GHz ITS band and the 900 MHz and 1900 MHz FRMCS bands. If 5G radio-communication technologies are used along the corridor, they should be based on the latest suitable 5G specifications made available by 3GPP, and furthermore be able to integrate upgrades when available. The infrastructure should support advanced service features such as quality of service guarantees enabled by 5G edge computing facilities and facilities allowing for 5G network slicing.
Studies should prove that interference issues with other C-ITS services using the 5.9 GHz ITS band are analysed and adequately addressed in the project. Particular attention should be paid to ensure continuity of legacy services and in particular continued functioning of safety-related services.
The corridor under study should incorporate solutions to integrate long-range and, if appropriate, short-range communication technologies and support infrastructures. The choice of these solutions will have to take into consideration the level of complementarity of both technologies, as well as efficiencies that may impact deployment costs, network performance, including quality of service, as well as scope and degree of innovation in use cases enabled.
The network quality of the corridor under study must go beyond existing and/or planned infrastructure along the full corridor and beyond any legally binding 4G or 5G coverage obligations attached to spectrum licences that apply to relevant parts of the corridors in question.
The study should plan for the operation of the service beyond the specific section supported by CEF, in view of the long-term development of the more extensive pan-European corridor network.
Studies should plan how the infrastructure is intended to be made available for CAM service providers or other users inside or outside the consortium, e.g. providing access on a non-discriminatory basis to all operators that hold relevant spectrum licenses in the territory concerned, while keeping in mind the respective levels of risk undertaken.
Studies should prepare modalities for post-project ownership and describe the mechanism(s) set in place for long-term cooperation and sustainability. In particular, it should be described how the infrastructure under study will be used for the provision of CAM services. Any arrangements for network sharing options should be clearly defined, as well as the functional and operational relationship(s) between the different participants in the value chain for the provision of digital services throughout the 5G corridor.
Studies should define a solid implementation plan, including access to services and applications with social, economic, and environmental benefits extending beyond the financing Member States, the beneficiaries or telecoms sector, as well as a commitment to maintain the infrastructure beyond the lifetime of the project. Studies should also include a plan to enable uninterrupted service beyond the cross-border sections funded.
The identification of options for specific measures addressing green policy objectives, in particular in terms of reducing the carbon footprint are encouraged.
Please consult the Call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.
Expected Impact:
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to prepare for 5G corridor work that will contribute to a wider plan to deploy uninterrupted, end-to-end 5G connectivity throughout the entire CEF corridor covered by the proposal, in synergy, where appropriate, with national actions, such as those identified under RRF.
The study should propose key parameters that will best describe the different features of the proposed 5G corridor, including the aggregate length of the corridors covered by 5G, the spectrum bands to be used along the sections, the inter-radio site distance, the availability of various service features along transport routes, as well as the available performance such as data rate and latency for each vehicle as a result of CEF Digital support.
Enabling the use of sharing models for both passive and active infrastructure is encouraged to increase the efficient use of funds provided under this programme. Sharing of both passive and active equipment by network operators (e.g. through a neutral host model) should aim at substantially reducing network deployment costs and at the same time facilitating the energy efficient use of resources when deploying and operating 5G infrastructure. In addition, wherever possible, existing infrastructure such as ducts, fibre, equipment shelters, power supply and utility poles should be used."

","12 January 2022
","22 March 2022","Objective:
This CSA will - in close cooperation with the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking - coordinate the development of 5G Strategic Deployment Agendas in the area of 5G for CAM.
This includes the development of deployment roadmaps, cooperation models and regulatory approaches.
Related objectives include the achievement of common deployment approaches among projects in view of a consistent deployment of 5G Corridors across the EU, monitoring and reporting on deployment progress, and the build-up of a pipeline of future projects to be funded by CEF.
Scope:
The CSA should facilitate the cooperation among the key stakeholders involved in 5G corridor preparation and CEF-funded deployment projects including the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) as well as key stakeholders of the SNS Joint Undertaking towards the development and adoption of non-binding SDA documents and related guidance by the Working Groups and Governing Board of the SNS JU.
This guidance shall include strategic elements relevant for SDAs such as evolving deployment roadmaps, cooperation models and relevant regulatory issues, e.g. cross-border roaming, spectrum use, network sharing, specialised services, etc.
The CSA should also work with ongoing CEF-funded deployment and preparation projects to keep track of deployments executed in projects, planned for future projects and evaluate the progress as compared to planned roadmaps.
It should also gather best practice in ongoing deployment and preparation projects including technological solutions used, use cases envisaged, service requirements for coverage and performance, etc.
The CSA should also support the building of future project pipelines for CEF funding by facilitating the information of the community with regards to upcoming CEF Digital calls, networking opportunities for building project consortia, engaging stakeholders to consider project proposals in line with planned deployment roadmaps and in close cooperation with the Commission and Member States.
The proposal should cover the following activities:
Support to the organisation of stakeholder engagement activities, involving, amongst others mobile network operators, operators deploying infrastructure and associated facilities such as tower companies, telecom backhaul operators, road operators, rail infrastructure managers, automotive manufacturers, and mobility service providers, including SNS working group secretariat, workshops, information days, seminars, conferences and online social networks.
Proactive outreach to stakeholders and public authorities to stimulate interest in proposal submission to CEF Digital calls in line with deployment roadmap and planned project pipeline.
Support and coordination to the building of project pipelines for CEF funding and community building, across sectors and cross-border.

","22 March 2022","Objective:
This topic aims to support an early wave of deployment actions for 5G systems deployment along transport paths for connected and automated mobility (CAM) including safety and non-safety services. These may encompass roads, rail, and inland waterways, and if appropriate in combination with other modes of transport based on early preparatory work that already started before the submission of the proposal. Unlike for the other subsequent waves, applicants will not be able to rely on prior CEF-funded inception studies; nevertheless, the results of preparatory works providing a basis for deployment plans are expected to be included in the proposal, building on other types of studies or on the basis of results generated by ongoing R&I 5G cross-border corridor trial projects conducted across the EU under Horizon 2020.
The goal is to start leveraging the needed private investment in order to establish a full pan-European road and railway network of 5G corridors by the end of the CEF programme (2027).
In parallel to this call, the Commission is launching a Coordination and Support Action (CSA), which aims at achieving 5G edge cloud integration and thus support and provide assistance in this area.
Scope:
This topic targets actions that support investments in challenging areas, where market forces alone will not deliver 5G services with the necessary quality of service, and focus on the provision of such connectivity along key European transport paths including, but not limited to, the indicative list of 5G corridors in the Annex part V of the CEF Regulation. The priority for the first three years of this work programme, including this call, will be to support investment in cross-border sections involving two or more Member States, with a co-funding rate of 50%.
In case of co-funding by national funds (i.e., Cohesion Funds and the Recovery and Resilience Facility - RRF), State aid rules within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU (see section 10 of the Work Programme for details) apply.
Applicants may apply for grants for works, including studies, related to project costs covering the following categories:
Deployment of passive network elements including civil works, e.g. ducts, dark fibre, 5G radio station, mast and pylons.
Deployment and installation of active network elements, e.g. antennae, storage and computing capabilities such as network controllers, routers, switch, exchanges, edge MEC/node etc.
Deployment and installation of specific track side devices (e.g. road, rail) for connected and automated mobility use cases, such as sensors, cameras etc. for traffic monitoring purposes, including connected road-side units.
Preparatory works, including network planning.
The 5G connectivity infrastructure deployment proposed for funding under this call may encompass both passive and active network elements along transport paths that cross at least one border between two Member States.
The corridor length foreseen for deployment or study on both/all sides of the border may vary, depending on national circumstances including the length of TEN-T comprehensive networks in the relevant Member State, means of transport, geographic situation, and maximum size of the project/EU funding.
Proposals concerning the same Member State may include cross-border sections of 5G corridors with other Member States representing up to 15% of the total length of all the TEN-T comprehensive corridors of the same category (road, rail or waterways) in the Member State concerned by the proposal. In the presence of a demonstrated market failure, longer cross-border sections (i.e. beyond the above mentioned 15% threshold) as well as sections located inside of a Member State territory could be considered. This possibility may be particularly relevant in the case of Member States where the length of TEN-T comprehensive corridors is limited.
The above 15% threshold or the need to justify the presence of a market failure do not apply to proposals designed as market-conform interventions.
Please consult the Call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.
Expected Impact:
CEF Digital funding is expected to move forward and accelerate large-scale deployment of 5G corridors to support the adoption of CAM, including driving with higher levels of automation and the digitalisation of rail operations as well as other relevant modes of transport. Funding may also support the deployment of Future Rail Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) and trackside and associated on-board equipment related to critical automatic train control systems and applications (ETCS and/or ATO).
By closing the deployment gaps and removing capacity bottlenecks and technical barriers, the deployment of 5G corridors would contribute to strengthening the social, economic, and territorial cohesion in the EU."

","22 March 2022","Objective:
The aim of this call is to support the early deployment of 5G-based systems that enable use cases for certain socio-economic drivers (SEDs). Within the context of this call, the targeted SEDs are public authorities exercising public powers and public or private entities entrusted with the operation of SGIs or SGEIs.
For guidance on whether a service is of general interest or general economic interest, please consult the Call document. The ultimate responsibility to define what constitutes a Service of General Interest lays with Member States.
Projects funded under this call are expected to:
a) Deploy 5G infrastructures capable of delivering leading-edge connectivity with characteristics (such as Gigabit performance, high-user-density, ubiquitous coverage, capacity to connect IoT devices, low latency and reliability) that are capable of supporting innovative ways of improving the provision of public services and SGIs or SGEIs;
b) Where necessary, bundle the deployed 5G networks with a cloud-to-edge middleware stack capable of supporting the data-intensive use cases and applications required by the involved SEDs.
The call aims to support 5G best practices beacons in different sectors that can serve as templates for possible replication with other resources or under other programmes (in particular RRF).
These projects are indirectly expected to demonstrate the potential capabilities and benefits of 5G networks and therefore stimulate the wider and faster deployment and take up of 5G across Europe. Projects will also contribute to provide the foundation for the development of “lead markets” for 5G and cloud-to-edge systems, eventually relying on technologies and standards developed under other EU programmes, in particular the Digital Europe Programme and Horizon Europe.
The indicative size of the CEF contribution to the financing of each project is expected to be in the range of EUR 300.000 to EUR 4 million. This range of project size is only indicative as the budget depends on the scope and objectives of the proposal and is based on the costs needed to achieve them.
Scope:
The CEF funding will cover the deployment of 5G infrastructure elements required to implement innovative use-cases by public authorities and SGI/SGEI providers. Proposals funded under the call are expected to rely on performance characteristics of the 5G technology that are indispensable to implement one or more use cases allowing the concerned public authority or SGI/SGEI provider(s) to deliver new or more efficient services.
The deployment or upgrade of backhaul and access networks connecting the premises where the 5G-supported project will be deployed with public electronic communication networks is not the main focus of this call. In principle, a Gigabit access network connecting the project should either already exist or be planned in parallel to the project. However the proposal may include a limited investment to complete or upgrade such access (indicatively in the order of 10% of the total eligible costs). In addition, if necessary for the implementation of the use case, the project can include the interconnection to federated cloud and edge computing infrastructures9. In both cases, such investments must be necessary to support the implementation of the 5G project related to the activity of the pubic authority of the SGI/SGEI provider concerned by the proposal. In addition within this maximum 10% threshold, CEF funding cannot exceed the net cost incurred for the deployment of the backhaul/access network or cloud/edge computing infrastructure linked to the 5G use case in question.
Proposals will need to justify the availability of the necessary co-funding for the 5G connectivity deployment as well as the financing of any costs linked to the execution of the whole 5G use case project (e.g. end-user devices, sensors, connectivity subscriptions etc.) that are not covered under this call.
Projects will also need to demonstrate that the infrastructure will be operated in a forward-looking and future-proof way based on state-of-the art protocols and standards, such as IPv6.
The beneficiary will be the operator(s) that will deploy the 5G network and provide the connectivity service required by one or more public authorities or SGI/SGEI providers. The later will be the end-users of the connectivity supported by the project and (despite the fact that they are not in charge of deploying the network infrastructure) should jointly apply to this call with the above-mentioned operator(s), describing (as part of Application Form Part B) the 5G innovative use case(s) they plan to develop. The description of such use case must contain all the elements demonstrating its viability, notably a reference to the availability of services and equipment required on top of the connectivity.
The project must be located in an area where no 5G network able to provide the quality of service needed by the supported use case is commercially available. For this reason, the description of the 5G innovative use case mentioned in the previous paragraph must be accompanied by a statement declaring that, after verification with each of the mobile network operators active in the area, the required 5G connectivity is not commercially available at the end-user location.
Furthermore, each proposal should be supported by local and/or regional authorities in the area where the deployment is foreseen to take place. This support may take the form of administrative letters, letters of intent, memoranda of understanding, or similar support documents and include an indication that no plans for other type of public support for the roll out of a 5G network is known to the abovementioned authorities.
Please consult the Call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.
Expected Impact:
CEF funding support is expected to accelerate the take-up of 5G connectivity for the provision of innovative services and contribute to a wider deployment and take up of 5G at the same time. Such services may help reboot the overall economy after the COVID crisis, as well as support the transition towards the smart provision of services in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal. Such 5G enabled innovation can include:
IoT infrastructure and community services that require a flexible, low-latency, reliable, high-user-density connectivity infrastructure, e.g. through a combination of fibre and wireless connectivity (5G, small cells, and Wi-Fi) that is IPv6 enabled.
5G-based use cases that leverage new 5G characteristics, e.g.: higher bandwidth and ubiquitous coverage (eMBB), ultra-low latency (uRLLC), massive machine-type (mMTC).
Process and data innovations that require connectivity infrastructures with advanced service features, e.g. quality of service guarantees enabled by edge computing facilities and support by network slicing.
Projects that rely, where relevant, on open, disaggregated and interoperable technology solutions (such as OpenRAN for example) and contribute to the emergence of a European ecosystem of 5G suppliers.
In addition to the support for local innovation, the EU added value is also based on the dissemination of the experience gained through the early adoption of concrete 5G use cases. This will contribute to gaining insights and increasing maturity for 5G-based applications in different sectors. The projects are expected to contribute to the dedicated Programme Support Action (see Section 5.3 of the Work Programme).
The key performance indicator for this call will include the number of new users of the 5G networks and the number of 5G-based use cases enabled as a result of CEF Digital support.
Beneficiaries will be asked to share their knowledge, achievements and lessons learnt, in order to demonstrate to citizens the benefits of 5G by providing concrete examples of 5G based use cases for public authorities or SGI/SEGEI providers.
It is expected that proposals funded under this call will stimulate a larger deployment and take up of 5G use-cases. This could also possibly be supported under the RRF, replicating best practices. The synergy with RRF could encompass wider “local digital transition projects” in which the 5G connectivity would be (co-)funded under this call and the remaining modules that are not covered by this call (e.g. the deployment of local computing, data or other digital capacities and solutions) would be funded under RRF or other programmes."

","CEF Infrastructure Projects
","12 January 2022
","22 March 2022","Objective:
CEF Digital aims to stimulate the commercial offering of cloud services throughout the EU. The cloud capacity will be strengthened and users will have access to multiple computing resources as a result of the projects supported by CEF.
This topic will support the deployment of Gigabit links for the interconnection between Socio-economic drivers that are public administrations or public or private entities entrusted with the operation of SGIs or of SGEIs and backbone networks for cloud federations. Market forces are not providing sufficient answers to the challenge of adequate interconnection with cloud providers. The deployments will take place where existing infrastructure cannot satisfy proper seamless functioning of resources from different providers, and also where there is a lack of the necessary redundancy to guarantee the reliability and resilience of cloud connectivity that can ensure adequate, safe and secure connectivity for the Gigabit society.
Scope:
This topic will support the deployment of new and significant upgrade of cloud interconnections, for which the market alone will not invest, because such an investment would not be commercially viable, i.e. where no relevant direct link of the same characteristics exists or is planned in the near future.
In addition, for links within Member States, to be eligible for funding under this call, projects must (i) address a market failure which cannot be solved by regulatory measures, (ii) avoid crowding out private investments or unduly distorting competition.
The topic will support the investment costs (studies, works and equipment) related to the development and deployment of cross-border and national cloud infrastructure interconnections at both the physical (i.e. very high capacity networks) and functional levels (i.e. management systems, and software-defined infrastructures) for public administrations or public and private entities entrusted with the operation of services of general interest or of Services of General Economic Interest (SGEIs) across the EU.
The applicants may apply for grants for works, including studies:
For works, the total project costs required to construct, long-term lease and deliver the described networking solution for the foreseen system lifetime, from end to end, including the on-premises portion.
Any costs for operating the infrastructure during the lifetime and extra components after the arrival on premises such as cloud resources not necessary to support the links, hosting facilities and other services, after the end of the project, will be excluded under the call.
For studies, all preparatory work required prior to signing a contract with a supplier is covered under this call. Studies specifically include topographic definition of the links for required permits and rights of way.
The end users will be public administrations or public and private entities entrusted with the operation of SGIs or SGEIs.
All proposals must define the post-project ownership of the infrastructure and describe the mechanism to be used to provide services, including business models. In particular, any arrangements for providing services on a non-discriminatory basis to different clouds, as well as the operational relationship(s) between the different participants in the value chain for providing services should be elaborated in the proposal. They should also provide the necessary security commitments to ensure the continuity of the level of security required during the implementation phase and explain how operators of essential services related to connectivity involved in the cross-border interconnection of national cloud infrastructures address the cybersecurity risks mentioned below.
In this context, proposals under this topic should address these federated cloud-to-edge infrastructures ‘as a product’ and will need to:
Cope with the latest digital and sustainability challenges, in particular:
enabling the industrial and low power processing of large amounts of data including in HPCs and at the edge;
fostering a swift and sustainable uptake of emerging technologies such as AI applications;
supporting the operationalisation of data spaces and specific use cases for socio-economic drivers;
Respond dynamically to needs of beneficiaries by providing data processing and storage capacities across the EU including at the edge at high speed, with low latency and in an energy and resource efficient manner;
Leverage high-performance end-to-end backbone connectivity;
Meet EU data protection, security, portability and environmental requirements; and anticipate forthcoming rules pursuant to the legislative work programme of the European Commission, notably the Data Governance Act, Digital Services Act, Digital Market Act and the Data Act.
In their proposals, applicants will need to demonstrate that they adhere to the data protection, security, portability and energy and resource efficiency requirements applicable to data-processing/storage services and activities developed under the relevant European codes of conduct, initiatives and legislation. Participants should also demonstrate that they have put in place all reasonable technical, legal and organisational measures in order to prevent transfer or access – including unsolicited transfers or access - to personal or non-personal data (including processed data and meta-data) held in the Union that would be unlawful under Union law or applicable national law.
This topic is complementary to the actions foreseen under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP), which focuses on the deployment at large-scale of the next generation of European cloud to edge services, the associated EU marketplace, and modular middleware platforms for interoperability between different data services.
Where applicable, proposals can as well be combined with the RRF in line with State aid rules as relevant, where CEF Digital is used to e.g. interconnect stakeholders across borders and RRF is used to complement with intra-national cloud infrastructure investments.
Proposals should also explain how operators of essential services related to connectivity involved in the cross-border interconnection of national cloud infrastructures address the cybersecurity risks.
Specific measures addressing green policy objectives, in particular in terms of reducing the carbon footprint, will be taken into account during the evaluation of proposals.
No State aid approval is required, if no state resources are used to co-finance the project. Applicants can find information on when State aid applies and whether it needs to be notified for cloud and edge investment in the State aid Cloud Capabilities Guiding Document.
Proposals funded under this topic may include synergetic (ancillary) elements relating to another sector of the CEF programme, i.e. energy and transport, if these synergetic elements allow to significantly improve the socio-economic, climate or environmental benefits of the action. CEF co-funding may be provided as long as the cost of these synergetic elements does not exceed 20% of the total eligible costs of the action.
Please consult the Call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.
Expected Impact:
The call aims to result in the following key benefits:
a) providing the key data processing infrastructures to support the digital transformation and modernisation of the public sector in Europe;
b) increased competitiveness and resilience of the EU computing industry in line with EU rules on data protection, security, portability and sustainability;
c) technological autonomy in essential digital computing infrastructures to process EU data, in particular through European common dataspaces; the infrastructure will also be an essential enabler for the roll-out of emerging technologies, including AI, IoT, HPC;
d) energy efficiency and sustainable large scale deployment of interconnected cloud-to-edge infrastructures across the EU territory.
Additionally, the expected benefits relate to addressing market failures by allowing cloud providers to act federated simulating the capacity of a cloud hyperscaler. Thus, they will contribute to bringing Digital autonomy to the EU and ensure widespread access to the Gigabit Society for all EU citizens and businesses.
The key performance indicators for the topic are:
the sum of the bandwidth-distance product of each deployed link (in Gb/s*Km) created between cloud providers;
the number of data centres of socio-economic drivers, including public-sector, which will be interconnected physically (fibre) or virtually (new software or middleware deployment)."

","CEF Infrastructure Projects
","12 January 2022
","22 March 2022","Objective:
This topic will support the deployment of a recursive European DNS resolver service infrastructure (hereafter DNS4EU) serving socio-economic drivers, public, corporate and residential internet end-users in the EU, and offering very high reliability and protection against global cybersecurity threats and those specific to the EU (e.g. phishing in EU languages). This is a key policy action announced in the 2020 “Joint Communication: The EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade”. Such a critical service infrastructure is currently not available at European level with the level of performance, resilience, security and privacy envisaged, and the market will not invest in it alone given the lack of a business case (DNS resolution is normally provided for free). As stated the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy, citizens and organisations in the EU increasingly rely on a few public DNS resolvers operated by non-EU entities. The deployment of DNS4EU aims to address such consolidation of DNS resolution in the hands of few companies, which renders the resolution process itself vulnerable in case of significant events affecting one major provider. Moreover the lack of significant EU investment in the field hampers the development of infrastructures that favour the detection and filtering of local cyber-threats that nonetheless could have significant socio-economic impacts. In addition, the processing of DNS data can have an impact on privacy and data protection rights.
DNS4EU shall offer a high level of resilience, global and EU-specific cybersecurity protection, data protection and privacy according to EU rules, ensure that DNS resolution data are processed in Europe and personal data are not monetised. It shall adhere to the latest internet security and privacy standards. It shall be widely discoverable and easy to configure by end-users on their equipment and software.
The service infrastructure shall offer additional optional services such as free parental control, as well as paid premium services for enhanced performance or security for corporate users.
Scope:
The proposal for this topic shall meet the following requirements at the level of users and services:
1. Customer base: Support the deployment of a recursive European DNS resolver service infrastructure serving EU-based internet users in need of privacy-respecting and secure DNS resolution to access resources on the internet. These users encompass socio-economic drivers, actors operating data and cloud infrastructures across the EU, public and private corporate users, and residential internet end-users in the EU. The proposal shall aim at a high adoption rate by addressing multiple customer bases (e.g. residential, education, governments, and vertical sectors).
2. Availability and service level: Provide wide geographic coverage in the EU, and ensure high reliability and uptime, as well as low latency of DNS resolution through among others a large distributed footprint (Points of Presence) and redundancy.
3. Accessibility: Ensure broad accessibility from user equipment, such as home routers and user devices, as well as from user software, such as major operating systems and browsers. DNS4EU shall be easy to configure by non-experts thanks to clear user guides and other support material available, including in audio-visual format, via a dedicated website under a clearly branded URL. The website shall contain all the relevant technical, legal and transparency-related information (e.g. protection of privacy, technical use of data) of the service.
4. Discoverability: The service shall be widely discoverable by major browsers, operating systems or user equipment. To this end it will be important to engage with industry groups (e.g. web browsers, ISPs), with the DNS standardisation community (e.g. DNS over HTTPS (DoH)) and other stakeholders.
5. Premium and wholesale services: Provide opt-in paid premium services for enhanced security (e.g. ad hoc filtering, monitoring, 24x7 support), tailored to specific sectorial needs (e.g. cloud, finance, health, transport), as well as wholesale resolution services for other digital service providers, including ISPs and cloud service providers.
6. Residential services: Offer to residential internet end-users strictly opt-in and fully transparent parental control filtering services. Other possible URL filtering services could also be offered in a strictly opt-in and fully transparent way. Such optional filtering shall be fully in line with national and EU rules (see below).
The proposal for the service infrastructure shall comply with the following security and privacy requirements and standards:
7. Security: State-of-the-art protection against cybersecurity threats by blocking malware, phishing and other threats based on reliable and up to date global threat feeds and own threat feeds developed on the basis of own threat detection and analysis as well as information exchange with trusted partners (e.g. CERTs), addressing in particular local threats (e.g. based on EU-languages). The corresponding threat detection and analysis infrastructure should be an integral part of the DNS4EU service infrastructure and provide a very high level of protection in the EU.
8. Data processing: Data processing shall be established through transparent and published policy and rules, in full compliance with EU rules (see below). DNS resolution data and meta-data shall be processed in the EU. There shall be no monetisation of personal data. Potential use of aggregated data (e.g. for cybersecurity analysis) shall be specified and made transparent.
9. Internet Standards: The service infrastructure shall conform to the latest security and privacy-enhancing standards (e.g. HTTPS, DNSSEC), including DNS encryption (e.g. DNS over TLS (DoT) and DoH) and be fully IPv6 compliant.
10. Best practices: Notwithstanding other requirements of this call or applicable law, the service infrastructure should be designed in line with industry best practices and guidelines for the provision of secure and privacy-preserving DNS resolution
The proposal for the service infrastructure shall comply with EU regulation and applicable national regulations of its Member States, in particular:
11. Data protection and privacy: Compliant with GDPR and national rules, where applicable.
12. Lawful filtering: Filtering of URLs leading to illegal content based on legal requirements applicable in the EU or in national jurisdictions (e.g. based on court orders), in full compliance with EU rules.
The proposal for the service infrastructure shall ensure a forward looking approach regarding technological innovation:
13. Technology/Innovation: The selected consortium will be expected to test and deploy innovative technologies, including the latest DNS security and privacy-enhancing technologies and technologies for the development and improvement of cybersecurity threat feeds, in collaboration with third-party innovators.
Priority will be given to proposals addressing the following aspects:
14. Governance/Federated structure: A federated and expandable service infrastructure with a diverse membership is preferred in order to maximise the footprint and customer base of DNS4EU across the EU, reduce costs through shared resources and ensure the long-term sustainability of DNS4EU.
The applicants may apply for grants for works, including studies. The grants are for:
project costs (e.g. studies, works and equipment) related to the development, construction and deployment of cross-border and national DNS resolution infrastructure at physical and functional levels for the foreseen system lifetime;
other equipment, goods, works and services necessary to support the infrastructure services.
Costs for operating the infrastructure during its lifetime will be excluded under the call.
Proposals funded under this topic may include synergetic (ancillary) elements relating to another sector of the CEF programme, i.e. energy and transport, if these synergetic elements allow to significantly improve the socio-economic, climate or environmental benefits of the action. CEF co-funding may be provided as long as the cost of these synergetic elements does not exceed 20% of the total eligible costs of the action.
Please consult the Call document for more information on the scope, including digital security requirements.
Expected Impact:
The deployment and wide use of DNS4EU will have the following key benefits:
Offer a high-end alternative to existing dominant non-EU public resolvers, leading to a more resilient, more secure and diversified DNS resolution offering for EU internet users.
Autonomy of DNS resolving, diminishing the dependency on major public resolvers established outside the EU, and reducing vulnerability to outages of these resolvers.
Complete safeguards for EU internet users that their data and privacy are protected and handled according to EU rules.
Increased protection against malicious activities based on both global and local (EU) threat feeds and intelligence.
Testing and deploying innovative technologies to enhance internet access security and privacy."

Scope:
Projects under this Strand shall address the different state of advancement and challenges of HEIs located in eligible third countries not associated to the programme, enhance the impact of the programme and where relevant complement other sources of funding. They shall introduce new approaches and initiatives in higher education, based on peer learning and transfer of experience and good practice affecting not only the institutions but also the society at large. Partnerships for transformation in higher education are complex and innovative capacity building projects based on a transfer of experience, competencies and good practice with a range of interconnected activities that aim to strengthen the capacities of the targeted HEIs to address the 21st century challenges such as migration, climate change, governance and shifts towards a digital economy. The projects’ outcomes should have a significant and long-term impact on the targeted HEIs beyond the projects' lifetime and as such benefitting the society as a whole. In particular, these projects will combine the following elements for the benefit of HEIs in the third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme:
Innovation in higher education in order to enhance its relevance for the labour market and the society. It is expected that the proposed projects address mismatches between the requirements of employers and the offer of higher education institutions and propose integral solutions to enhance better employability of students. This can be done by implementing comprehensive interventions that include:
the design of innovative curricula and introducing innovative elements in the existing curricula;
the implementation of innovative learning and teaching methods (i.e. learner-centred and real problem-based teaching and learning);
the active engagement with the business world and with research, the organisation of continuing educational programmes and activities with and within enterprises;
the strengthening of the capacities of HEIs in the third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme to network effectively in research, scientific and technological innovation.
Promoting reform in HEIs to become catalysts of economic and social development in the third countries not associated to the programme. Projects should support HEIs to develop and implement the institutional reforms that will make them more democratic, inclusive, equitable and full-fledged constituents of the civil society. Institutional reforms include new governance and management systems and structures, readiness in terms of digital skills, modern university services, quality assurance processes, tools and methods for professionalisation and professional development of academic, technical and administrative staff. The development of an entrepreneurial mind-set and improved competencies and skills within the institutions are key aspects for the success of this Strand. Transversal skills learning, entrepreneurship education and the practical application of entrepreneurial skills will enable HEIs to put their knowledge and resources at the service of their local/national/regional communities.
Overarching priorities to be covered by projects under Strand 2
Each applicant will need to identify in Part C of the application form only one of the overarching priorities, which are defined by the Commission per Region.

Please note that the overarching priorities for Region 7 (Middle East) and Region 8 (Pacific) are applicable only for multi-national projects involving more than one Regions.
OVERARCHING PRIORITIES IN REGIONS 1- 3
Region 1: Western Balkans
Green deal: Projects should promote long-term economic recovery by increasing the Region’s competitiveness and stimulating green jobs. Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow.
Digital transformation: Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Encourage development and implementation of digital education strategies. Accompany the digital transition by mainstreaming digitalisation in education systems and reinforcing programmes covering digital skills. Provide assistance to teacher training and online education learning.
Migration and Mobility: Projects should promote mobility and in particular, support recognition of degrees and credentials in the Region, and contribute to a regional credit transfer system to enable intra-regional connectivity and building a regional higher education area.
Governance, peace, security and human development: Address regional structural weaknesses by supporting cooperation and/or reforms in the areas of governance, rule of law and the fight against corruption. Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A key objective is to tackle the existing mismatch between education outcomes and labour market demands, including through the development of work-based learning. Inclusiveness participation of all citizens, including Roma, in education and training systems will ensure that no one is left behind.
Region 2: Neighbourhood East
Green deal: Support the modernisation of economies, making them more competitive and innovative, while ensuring the green transition towards climate neutrality. Research & innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills & jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.
Digital transformation: Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.
Migration and Mobility: Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition. Provide for the integration of migrants and displaced persons by granting access to education, including language education and scholarships.
Governance, peace, security and human development: Contribute to an area of democracy, prosperity, stability, security and increased cooperation between resilient and inclusive societies sharing common values. Projects should notably focus on rule of law reforms, protection of human rights, the fight against corruption and discrimination, media literacy, the role of an independent media and civil society and promotion of gender equality.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Investing in young people and better connecting education, research and innovation with private sector needs are crucial building blocks in achieving economies that work for all. Areas of particular focus are teacher training, youth entrepreneurship, the offer and uptake of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) skills, and related gender inclusiveness. Linkages with the green transition towards climate neutrality should be stressed. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote areas, including rural areas.
Region 3: South-Mediterranean countries
Green deal: Projects should contribute to an inclusive, long-term socio-economic recovery and tap into the Region’s economic potential by supporting the circular and green economy as well as urban development. Priorities include increasing climate awareness, sustainability and resilience, specifically in the key sectors of agriculture, energy and water management. Furthermore, academic cooperation should aim to provide applicable answers to environmental challenges, including desertification, biodiversity loss and use of natural resources.
Digital transformation: Projects should seize the digital transition by working on digital literacy, skills and entrepreneurship. In parallel, digital solutions can provide new means to reach out to vulnerable communities. Cooperation opportunities also lie in digital infrastructure and connections, where heightened reliability, capacity and security will support regional economic integration.
Migration and Mobility: Education access for displaced persons and refugees is a priority objective for the entire Region. Support intra-regional initiatives on credential and degree recognition as well as regional credit transfer systems. Opportunities and jobs, as referred to in the other regional priorities, should be inclusive of all, including migrants and displaced persons.
Governance, peace, security and human development: Commitment to the rule of law, human and fundamental rights, equality, democracy and good governance are the bedrock of stable, fair and prosperous societies. Initiatives on peace and security, intercultural dialogue and women empowerment are encouraged, hereby driving respect for diversity, tolerance and strengthening the Mediterranean partnership.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Improving education systems governance and addressing structural causes of schools dropouts are crucial to meet youth aspirations and to address persisting economic and gender inequalities. An integral part to this process is developing primary and secondary teacher education and in-service training. Stronger linkages between the academic, research and business world are to be stimulated, with education programmes addressing current and future skills needs, not in the least entrepreneurship. Innovation hubs and start-ups help generate local employment opportunities and prevent brain drain. Particular attention is to be paid to women participation.
OVERARCHING PRIORITIES IN REGIONS 4-11
Region 4: Russian Federation
The projects involving the Russian Federation must focus on the overarching and sub-priorities (for Regions 1-3) depending on the Regions they are cooperating with.
Region 5: Asia
Green deal: Projects should respond to the growing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation in Asia and provide capacities for climate-resilient studies to provide solutions to environmental challenges in the Region. Projects should also support the green and economic transition in Asia by strengthening links with the private sector and by enhancing the knowledge and skills needed for a modern work force.
Digital transformation: Promoting digital technologies and services will foster socio-economic development in Asia. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide in Asia by promoting and developing digital literacy and skills as well as support the digital economy and connectivity through digital education strategies.
Migration and Mobility: Projects should promote mobility and in particular support the recognition of degrees and credentials in Asia, also to support intra-regional connectivity. Projects should support the integration of migrants and displaced persons through the access to education.
Governance, peace, security and human development: To advance social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity such as for democratic governance, human development, and intercultural dialogue, thereby exposing the Region to European best practices in this regard.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Due to Asia’s economic dynamism, projects should support the upskilling of the young population in Asia. Projects should also help to identify education gaps that can contribute to economic growth and jobs, while exporting the EU’s sustainable growth and governance model.
Region 6: Central Asia
Green deal: One of the objectives of the EU in the Region is to accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy, as Central Asia has a great potential for green energy. Projects should thus accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy and tackle trans-regional environmental challenges through accompanying links with the private sector as well as enhanced study and educational capacities.
Sustainable growth and jobs: The development of skills will be key to Central Asia’s competitiveness and social cohesion. Projects should promote knowledge-based economies and enhance synergies between education systems and the labour market, and should be linked with promoting digital literacy and skills.
Region 7: Middle East
Green deal: Projects should contribute to a green and sustainable economic recovery and transition as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting reforms of education systems and by strengthening links with the private sector, while also exposing higher education institutions in the Region to European practices.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Projects should support the Region’s diversification and sustainable development and address the mismatch between the education system and needs of the labour market, also providing support to team up with the private sector, to foster economies that work for all. Projects could be linked with the Green Deal priority by enhancing educational capacities concerning the Region’s green transition.
Region 8: Pacific
Green Deal: There is no other region in the world more threatened by climate change and engaged in climate action, as environmental degradation greatly hampers deeper development in the Pacific. Projects should therefore help to modernise economies in the Region by establishing links with the private sector as well as creating knowledge and capacity to help the Region further adapt to climate change and a changing work dynamic.
Sustainable growth and jobs: The countries of the Pacific Region suffer from a very narrow market size, offering very few job opportunities. Projects should support the creation of stable and reliable internal repositories of knowledge and competencies, avoiding a brain drain and enhancing the domestic education systems. In this respect, one of the main cornerstones will be the development of the “blue economy” concept.
Region 9: Sub-Saharan Africa
Green deal: Contribute to a successful green and sustainable global economic recovery (including climate change, environment and energy), awareness-raising, green jobs.
Digital transformation: Performing digital education eco-systems, improving digital skills and competences, connectivity, teacher training.
Migration and mobility: Recognition of qualifications, legal pathways, integration of migrants and displaced persons, education access, scholarships, language education.
Governance, peace, security and human development: Human rights, social and economic rights, democracy, fundamental values, governance, citizenship, health, youth, gender, access and inclusion.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Skills, entrepreneurship, employability, links to the labour market and jobs creation, job opportunities, rural areas, private sector involvement
Region 10: Latin America
Green deal: Latin American countries (LAC) are key partners for a global transition towards a greener and climate neutral development path. The Region is home to around of 50% of the global biodiversity and has a tremendous potential for renewable but also is highly vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Projects should respond to those environmental challenges enhancing capacities in the Region. Projects should also support the private sector for their green and economic transition and enhance the needed knowledge and skills.
Digital transformation: Digital transformation can support sustainable recovery in Latin American countries, address traps and increase competitiveness. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide, developing digital literacy and skills, as well as scientific, technical and innovation capacities fostering links between education, research and business. Earth observation and spatial technologies allow increasing climate change mitigation and creating innovation paths.
Governance, peace, security and human development: Strengthening social cohesion remains a priority for the LAC Region, which is the most unequal of the world. Projects should contribute to build inclusive societies by developing awareness and strengthening capacities in areas such as education, health, gender equality, access and inclusion, human rights, including social, economic, and cultural rights. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote and rural areas. Projects support intra-regional connectivity and contribute to the development of the LAC Higher Education Area, particularly the recognition of degrees and credit transfer systems and qualifications. Projects should support as well the integration of migrants, refugees and displaced persons through the access to education.
Sustainable growth and jobs: To accompany the LAC Region to a sustainable inclusive economic recovery, projects should put the accent to respond to the needs of emerging sectors, as green, blue, digital and orange economy. Projects should also help to identify education gaps in the different areas in close cooperation with the private sector.
Region 11: Caribbean
Green deal: Two main elements have a critical impact on the Caribbean: i) climate change and natural disasters and ii) unsustainable production and excessive generation of waste. Both put the Caribbean marine and terrestrial ecosystems under pressure and vulnerable to external shocks. Projects should contribute to adapt to climate change and reduce risks in areas as transition to low-carbon economies, renewable energy, waste management, agri-food value chains.
Governance, peace, security and human development: To contribute to more inclusive and resilient societies and advance on social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity in areas as education, health, gender equality and inclusiveness.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Developing knowledge, in connection with the labour market needs, in areas with growth potential (such as creative industries and services) and emerging sectors (blue, green, and digital economy) can generate a multiplying effect. Projects can contribute to find regional solutions to common challenges such as connectivity and regional integration, as well reducing youth unemployment rates and brain drain.

The Capacity Building in Higher Education (CBHE) action supports international cooperation projects based on multilateral partnerships between organisations active in the field of higher education. It supports the relevance, quality, modernisation and responsiveness of higher education in third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme for socio-economic recovery, growth and prosperity and reacting to recent trends, in particular economic globalisation but also the recent decline in human development, fragility, and rising social, economic and environmental inequalities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The action is expected to contribute to the overarching priorities of the European Commission: the Green Deal (including climate change, environment and energy), digital transformation and data technologies, alliances for sustainable growth and jobs, migration partnerships, and governance, peace and security and to the external dimension of EU internal policies in the field of education. It will support a successful green and sustainable global economic recovery in the third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme, linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement.
The activities and outcomes of CBHE projects must be geared to benefit the eligible third countries not associated to the programme, their higher education institutions (HEI) and systems.

Projects under this Strand shall support efforts in third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme to develop coherent and sustainable systems of higher education to meet their socio-economic needs and broad ambition to create a knowledge-driven economy. Mainstreaming and upscaling of successful results as well as synergies with ongoing or pipeline support in the area under bilateral support programmes are also elements of this Strand. Structural Reform projects will address the needs of eligible third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme to support sustainable systemic and structural improvement and innovation at the level of the higher education sector. More specifically, these projects will address the efforts of countries to develop coherent and sustainable systems of Higher Education to meet their socio-economic needs and ultimately create a knowledge-driven economy. By involving the competent National Authorities (notably Ministries of Education) of third countries not associated to the programme, HEIs, Research institutions and other relevant authorities/bodies and stakeholders, these projects will particularly:
Promote cooperation and mutual learning among and between public authorities at the highest institutional level of the EU Member states or countries associated to the Erasmus+ programme and the eligible third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme to foster systemic improvement and innovation in the higher education sector.
Promote inclusive higher education systems that can provide the right conditions for students of different backgrounds to access learning and succeed. Particular attention should therefore be paid to people with fewer opportunities.
Increase the capacities of HEIs of third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme, bodies in charge of higher education and competent authorities (notably Ministries) through their participation in the definition, implementation and monitoring of reform processes to modernise their higher education systems, particularly in terms of governance and financing;
Identify synergies with ongoing EU initiatives in the third country(ies) not associated to the programme in areas covered by Erasmus+.
Priorities under Strand 3
Given the nature of this Strand, which aims at supporting structural reforms in the third countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme, the project must address the needs of higher education in the country(ies) concerned. Therefore, no overarching priorities are indicated in Part C of the application form.

Scope:
This Strand is designed to attract less experienced HEIs and small-scale actors to the CBHE action to facilitate access to newcomer organisations. These partnerships should act as a first step for HEIs and organisations with a smaller operational capacity located in third countries not associated to the programme to access and increase means to reach out to people with fewer opportunities. This Strand will finance small-scale projects to reduce the internationalisation gap among HEIs from eligible third countries not associated to the programme, from the same country or Region. Projects should establish partnerships to develop cooperation ideas as well as to facilitate transfer of know-how, experience and good practices, fostering access to capacity building opportunities and improving social inclusion and the access of students/staff with fewer opportunities to a qualitative higher education offer. In particular, these projects will particularly focus on:
HEIs from least developed countries not associated to the Erasmus+ programme;
HEIs located in remote regions/areas of third countries not associated to Erasmus+ programme;
Newcomers or less experienced HEIs and Faculties from third countries not associated to the programme;
Involvement of students and staff with fewer opportunities.
Overarching priorities to be covered by projects under Strand 1
Each applicant will need to identify in Part C of the application form only one of the overarching priorities, which are defined by the Commission per Region.
For Regions 1 to 3 sub-priorities have also been defined (see Part C of the application form). Within the overarching priority identified by the applicant, the project must choose mandatorily only one sub-priority.
For Regions 4 to 11 only overarching priorities exist and only one of them has to be chosen by the project.
OVERARCHING PRIORITIES IN REGIONS 1- 3
Region 1: Western Balkans
Green deal: Projects should promote long-term economic recovery by increasing the Region’s competitiveness and stimulating green jobs. Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow.
Digital transformation: Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Encourage development and implementation of digital education strategies. Accompany the digital transition by mainstreaming digitalisation in education systems and reinforcing programmes covering digital skills. Provide assistance to teacher training and online education learning.
Migration and Mobility: Projects should promote mobility and in particular, support recognition of degrees and credentials in the Region, and contribute to a regional credit transfer system to enable intra-regional connectivity and building a regional higher education area.
Governance, peace, security and human development: Address regional structural weaknesses by supporting cooperation and/or reforms in the areas of governance, rule of law and the fight against corruption. Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A key objective is to tackle the existing mismatch between education outcomes and labour market demands, including through the development of work-based learning. Inclusiveness participation of all citizens, including Roma, in education and training systems will ensure that no one is left behind.
Region 2: Neighbourhood East
Green deal: Support the modernisation of economies, making them more competitive and innovative, while ensuring the green transition towards climate neutrality. Research & innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills & jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.
Digital transformation: Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.
Migration and Mobility: Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition. Provide for the integration of migrants and displaced persons by granting access to education, including language education and scholarships.
Governance, peace, security and human development: Contribute to an area of democracy, prosperity, stability, security and increased cooperation between resilient and inclusive societies sharing common values. Projects should notably focus on rule of law reforms, protection of human rights, the fight against corruption and discrimination, media literacy, the role of an independent media and civil society and promotion of gender equality.
Sustainable growth and jobs: Investing in young people and better connecting education, research and innovation with private sector needs are crucial building blocks in achieving economies that work for all. Areas of particular focus are teacher training, youth entrepreneurship, the offer and uptake of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) skills, and related gender inclusiveness. Linkages with the green transition towards climate neutrality should be stressed. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote areas, including rural areas.
Region 3: South-Mediterranean countries
Green deal: Projects should contribute to an inclusive, long-term socio-economic recovery and tap into the Region’s economic potential by supporting the circular and green economy as well as urban development. Priorities include increasing climate awareness, sustainability and resilience, specifically in the key sectors of agriculture, energy and water management. Furthermore, academic cooperation should aim to provide applicable answers to environmental challenges, including desertification, biodiversity loss and use of natural resources.
Digital transformation: Projects should seize the digital transition by working on digital literacy, skills and entrepreneurship. In parallel, digital solutions can provide new means to reach out to vulnerable communities. Cooperation opportunities also lie in digital infrastructure and connections, where heightened reliability, capacity and security will support regional economic integration.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Contribute to the objectives of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by accelerating the transition towards climate neutrality in cities;
Develop and implement a convincing approach to explore, test and evaluate the resilience and adaptability of urban public transport and promote its accrued use in line with the priorities of the European Green Deal, as part of the wider integrated urban and peri-urban mobility system;
Using innovative co-creation methods involving a wide range of stakeholders (e.g. public transport employees, passengers, the city authority), improve the overall public transport offer and its attractiveness in line with users’ needs and expectations, including affordability, inclusiveness and ensuring equal access for reduced mobility;
Using simulation tools and data, understand and trigger behaviour change in favour of public transport;
Understand dependencies between public transport and active travel modes including requirements towards multi-modal hubs and access-infrastructures;
Increase the share of public transport (modal split) in the modal distribution of motorized transportation by approximately 30% [1] in the cities involved in the projects [2] compared to their baseline at the start of the project and cover different market/customer segments, aiming at catering for specific needs of specific target groups, e.g. a better social inclusion and healthier lifestyles, envisioning a social optimum and the concept of Mobility as a Right;
Increase user satisfaction with public transport by 25% compared to the baseline;
Identify lessons and mutual learning at European level facilitating replication, upscaling and up-taking of the tested blueprints;
Put in place or update a local policy framework for public transport, in line with the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) guidelines and spatial planning, including clear commitments from the relevant authorities to implement it in the short and medium term.
Scope:
The European Green Deal demands ambitious decarbonisation and pollution targets and a socially just transition to mitigate related pricing policies. The Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, hereafter referred to as the Cities Mission, will support at least 100 cities in becoming climate neutral by 2030 and use these cities as innovation hubs for all cities to become climate neutral by 2050. Achieving this objective requires a systemic approach by the cities to reduce all GHG emissions, in particular in the mobility sector.
Public transport should continue to be the backbone of urban mobility, offer access and remain accessible at a reasonable cost. Public transport concepts also need to consider and include the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, scooters etc. Urban public transport needs to be understood in a broad sense including peri-urban areas and commuter belt. At the same time, Covid-19 and similar events can undermine trust between operators and passengers. Attractive, safe and secure mass transit accessibility is essential for cities that expect sprawl, population increase and economic growth. Public transport not only helps achieve environmental goals, but also plays a key role in the economy and job creation and in promoting territorial accessibility. In addition, public transport is intrinsic to the EU pillar of social rights as regards “Access to essential services”. As such, it should cater to the widest possible array of user groups and their needs. This includes persons irrespective of gender, age, disability, income, education level, and digital experience. Moreover, where public transport is widely accessible, there is increased road safety.
The objective of this call is to increase the uptake of replicable public transport solutions in the living labs involved in the proposals while facilitating joint lesson-drawing and learning at European level. The funded actions will contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission and to the priorities of the European Green Deal, which stresses that “transport should become drastically less polluting, especially in cities. A combination of measures should address emissions, urban congestion and improved public transport”.
New approaches and financing models are emerging. A secure, efficient, clean, reliable, attractive and affordable public transport is essential to address the variety of mobility needs. At the same time, it can become a silver bullet for reducing transport’s negative externalities.
Projects should enhance the public transport share in the modal distribution by 30% compared to the baseline defined for each experimentation site at the start of the project and against which progress will be assessed. The call invites proposals from consortia composed of living labs in at least four cities[3] from different Member States or Associated Countries together with at least four twinning cities, where the responsible local authorities, public transport providers and other relevant actors team up to test and implement packages of technological and non-technological innovations and policy-based measures to improve the public transport offer in line with citizens’ needs. Twinning cities can be from the same Member State or Associated Country as the lead cities.
Proposals should aim to improve the competitiveness of public transport by implementing in the living labs integrated, complementary and reinforcing packages of urban mobility measures. The packages should combine “push measures” (e.g. congestion charges, parking charges or reduced parking supply) with “pull measures” (e.g. safe and secure transport hubs, bus lanes, new zero emission rolling stock, Mobility As a Service (MaaS)/multimodal ticketing/digital payments-related incentives, facilitation of combining public transport with active modes, and an improved integration and interoperability with new mobility services).
The projects associated to this call topic should produce a comprehensive topic guide accompanying the SUMP guidelines, on public transport promotion, planning and inclusion into SUMP processes.
The package of measures could include newly-emerging technologies and soft measures such as marketing, real time information and awareness raising campaigns and co-creation of user-oriented solutions– with particular regard to the specific needs of diverse user groups (e.g. related to gender, age, disability, income, education level, and digital experience).
Proposals submitted could test the establishment of new operating and business models, where public transport providers and shared and/or on-demand mobility providers cooperate to offer services addressing user needs following the area’s typology and characteristics. Drawing on digital solutions such as AI, Digital Twins and High Performance Computing, the research could look into public transport policy evolution, users' behaviour over time, free public transport and institutional and collaborative frameworks. Proposals could also consider new business/operational models to exploit the unused capacity of public transport passenger vehicles for freight and parcel transport (cargo hitching), exploring e.g. combination with active modes and silent, zero tailpipe emission vehicles for the last mile/metres.
Proposals should ensure that an appropriate geographical balance across Europe is achieved (also ensuring the inclusion of cities in less developed and peripheral regions) to maximise impact without leaving anyone behind, and by demonstrating commitment of cooperation with concrete activities.
To allow for a thorough evaluation, a clear baseline of the use of public transport should be established in each participating city from the start of the project including a detailed analysis of present and future potential user groups. Actions should provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed measures in achieving the objectives set out by the topic, the local policy objectives should be evaluated against the baseline and the possible barriers to their broad take up, and deployment identified, together with recommendations on how to overcome them. This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the CIVITAS Initiative.
Proposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined during the grant agreement phase. Collaboration with the Mission Platform (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) is essential and should take place through the CIVITAS initiative. The latter should establish, through a collaboration agreement, clear links with the Mission portfolio for synergies and complementarities.
Proposals may include demonstrations, preparatory, take-up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making. A demonstrated contribution to the implementation of the cities’ SUMP is expected, as well as integration with relevant other plans, such as air quality plans and noise management action plans[4] .
Meaningful results can be shared with the upcoming European Urban Initiative of Cohesion policy and the Urban Agenda for the EU. Proposals could also engage with relevant smart specialisation partnerships or EIT Urban Mobility.
To facilitate replication, upscaling and uptaking of the generated outcomes and to foster capacity building/upskilling of public authorities, local actors and communities, actions should engage in ambitious outreach, communication, dissemination and training activities in coordination and complementarity with the Mission Platform.
Actions should envisage, as appropriate, collaboration with other relevant projects on testing integrated shared automated mobility solutions for people and goods (topic HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-01) funded under the European Partnership on CCAM.

[1]The call acknowledges that reaching the suggested target share of public transport will be difficult for cities where a large portion of the population is engaged in active travel modes, and it would be counter-productive to the climate-objectives of the Mission to move these active travel users to public transport
[2]Three cities acting as living labs from different Member States or Associated Countries should be involved/project, together with three twining cities. An appropriate budget should be reserved to the twinning cities to deliver on their objectives within the project. The living labs should cover the full local transport catchment area or commuting zone of an urban core (or functional urban area). The key elements of living labs are: active user involvement, multiple-stakeholder platform for innovation in real-life contexts, multi-method, and co-creation approach.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
Contribute to the objectives of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by accelerating the transition towards climate neutrality in cities;
Large-scale demonstration and implementation of Positive Clean Energy Districts[1] to prove their feasibility and cost-effectiveness in a real world environment, i.e. they will be fully integrated in the city context at all levels;
Projects will be at district (project defined[2]) scale and will have long-term strategies that address the (at times conflicting) needs and requirements of inhabitants, energy, mobility (both passenger mobility and freight transport), ICT and environment at district scale [3] in order to make cities more liveable, healthier, resource efficient and climate-neutral. Projects will include different social and economic areas at the district level;
Collaborative structures that bring together all important actors needed to realize Positive Clean Energy Districts, i.e. cities/metropolitan areas, industry/SMEs, property developers/financial actors, R&I organisations, energy service providers, citizens associations, energy agencies, etc. They will closely collaborate among each other and with the Horizon 2020 Smart Cities and Communities Lighthouse projects cluster, the supporting SCALE service contract and the Smart Cities Marketplace;
Widening and consolidating the Positive Clean Energy cluster of practitioners and strengthened links with financial actors enabling the mid-term Europe-wide uptake of tested solutions for Positive Clean Energy Districts;
Paradigm shift from demonstration project to mainstreamed long-term city transformation;
Evidence of decreased investment risk for - and acceleration of - the rollout of Positive Clean Energy Districts;
Well-proven and documented packaged solutions that lower the entry barrier, create trust and shape the market, ultimately leading to further large-scale investment;
City alliances that include also small and very small cities as well as cities in less developed and peripheral regions - to enhance opportunities for accessing knowledge, technology and funding, and in turn provide a factual contribution toward meeting the climate targets.
Scope:
The topic addresses the objectives of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, hereafter referred to as the Cities Mission, to (1) support, promote and showcase 100 climate-neutral and smart European cities by 2030 and (2) make these cities act into experimentation and innovation hubs to put all European cities in a position to become climate-neutral by 2050. The topic will thus contribute to the twin green and digital transitions promoted by the European Green Deal and will lead by example on how to speed up the necessary transformation towards urban climate neutrality, including in a human-centred way.
Cities are natural testbeds for innovative integrated solutions and for showcasing the different possibilities for achieving climate neutrality and zero pollution objectives. Early mover cities towards climate neutrality and zero pollution by 2030 will pave the way for all cities to follow by 2050. They should therefore lead the way towards an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities.
The concept of Lighthouse and Fellow cities[4] pioneered under Horizon 2020 yielded good results and a similar project structure is encouraged[5].
Since Positive Clean Energy Districts are a crucial element of the climate-neutral cities of the future, the concept of scale and of representativeness of the various socio-economic contexts/groups of citizens are of highest importance for effective and impactful urban transformation, taking into account cross-sectoral impacts, interdependencies and co-benefits. The expertise acquired at district scale - by facilitating and analysing the intricate interactions between all involved layers and actors - is essential for subsequent scale-up to city scale. This is again paramount if we want to meet the 2050 climate and zero pollution goals where cities play a pivotal role. The scope of the projects will therefore be to:
Test large-scale Positive Clean Energy Districts under real life conditions and analyse:
The main aspects of successful conception and roll-out of Positive Energy Districts;
Combinations of demand measures (e.g. energy efficiency, demand response and user behaviour) and supply measures (e.g. onsite RES and storage, including from EVs, building/district management) at district scale to identify the best cost-effective mix;
Synergies between the built environment, energy communities, active and e-mobility (e.g. integration of smart and/or bidirectional EV charging), smart grids (e.g. heating/cooling, electricity) and energy storage. Inclusion of resource efficient smart water and waste management is also an asset;
Key elements of replicability for scaling up Positive Clean Energy Districts (in the same city/region and also beyond), for example the use of open standards and technical specifications and open source tools is encouraged.
Demonstrate different combinations of technologies to achieve Positive Clean Energy Districts and analyse the most cost-efficient combinations.
Develop business models and governance structures that are best suited for Positive Clean Energy Districts (e.g. studying the most effective incentive schemes for behavioural change, development and integration of sustainable energy communities).
Test and adapt different management systems/platforms and citizen interaction and related co-creation and communication strategies that facilitate the implementation of Positive Clean Energy Districts.
Optimise on-site energy storage systems (e.g. thermal, electrical) linked with local non-combustion RES production (including excess energy from local/ regional industry), use of low carbon materials, and e-mobility (both passenger mobility and freight transport).
Integrate low to zero pollution heating and cooling systems (e.g. solar thermal district heating plants) making best use of local assets.
Test Positive Clean Energy District grid solutions, demand response and other smart energy management strategies that help to optimise the larger energy system. To address the cybersecurity aspect, the task will be implemented in close collaboration with the projects funded under the Horizon Europe topic C5-D3-ESGS-06-2021 addressing the reliability and resilience of the grid.
Establish a project structure that actively involves the local city administrations and mayors of other cities in co-creation, inter-city peer review process and formal collaborations based on officially adopted shared principles.
Involve owners/inhabitants but also financial actors as consortium partners already in the development phase, with the perspective to scale up from project to real city transformation.
Apart from implementing their own innovative approaches, projects are strongly encouraged to build and capitalise on the wealth of proven solutions of Horizon 2020 Smart Cities and Communities Lighthouse Projects cluster [6] and advancing the chosen solutions towards the necessary mainstreaming on the mid/long term.
Projects are also expected to collaborate with and contribute to the specific objectives of the SET Plan action 3.2 - Smart cities and communities - focusing on positive-energy blocks and districts (PED).
Proposals are expected to demonstrate very good knowledge of the European Smart Cities and Communities ecosystem and to pay specific attention to synergies with relevant policies such as the Renovation Wave and with other relevant initiatives such as the European Partnership on Driving Urban Transition for a sustainable future (DUT)[7], the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People)[7], the Covenant of Mayors, the Smart Cities Market Place[9], Living-in.EU, Clean Energy Transition (LIFE), EIT InnoEnergy, the upcoming European Urban Initiative of Cohesion policy, the Urban Agenda for the EU, as well as relevant projects such as the Lighthouse projects of the New European Bauhaus initiative and relevant smart specialisation partnerships.
The projects funded under this topic must establish a collaboration agreement, to identify clear links among themselves and ensure complementarity, coordination and exchange on relevant linked activities. The selected projects should also foresee active collaboration with relevant and related projects funded under this call in order to address synergies and complementarities between the projects of the Cities Mission portfolio. In particular collaboration with the Mission Platform (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) is essential and projects should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the workplan. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined at a second stage during the lifetime of the projects. The collaboration with the Mission Platform should be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the projects starting date.
To facilitate replication and reuse of the solutions developed as part of these actions, use of open source software, open standards and technical specifications[10], re-use of building blocks and interoperability solutions[11], and sharing of data through EU data spaces are encouraged where appropriate.
To facilitate replication, upscaling and up-taking of the generated outcomes and to foster capacity building/upskilling of public authorities, local actors and communities, the projects should engage in ambitious outreach, communication, dissemination and training activities in coordination and complementarity with the Mission Platform.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Facilitate the management and transfer of global knowledge on the topic of climate action in cities, helping cities move closer to climate neutrality;
Increase the visibility of the EU and its cities as frontrunners and collaboration-minded partners in urban climate action;
Contribute to the implementation of EU policy and international commitment (European Green Deal, Global Approach to Research and Innovation).
Scope:
Climate neutrality is a global challenge that requires international dialogue and cooperation, including among cities. Cities account for more than 70% of CO2 emissions and over 65% of energy consumption worldwide. As such, they play a strategic role in climate change mitigation as hotspots of challenges and solutions. They are also uniquely positioned to reap multiple co-benefits from climate action such as reduced air and noise pollution as well as less congestion and more active lifestyles, leading to improved health and wellbeing for their inhabitants.
Many cities across the world have climate action plans in place and are looking for solutions on how to best bridge the implementation gap between their climate neutrality goals and the pace of current transformation. These solutions can often be found via cooperation and exchanges that transcend national and regional borders. To advance this process, the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, hereafter referred to as the Cities Mission, aims to set a leading international example, with at least 100 climate-neutral cities at the heart of a wide international knowledge and practice network focused on delivering urban solutions for climate neutrality.
In line with this ambition, the coordination and support action will set up a Global Knowledge Exchange Centre on emissions reduction pathways for urban environments. This global platform will coordinate the international outreach activities of the Cities Mission, thus expanding and complementing the geographical scope and reach of the Mission Platform[1]. It will cater to a wide spectrum of European and international urban stakeholders such as local authorities, representatives of international organisations and other policymakers, researchers and urban practitioners, representatives of the industry and the private sector, civil society and citizens.
The platform will establish a geographically and thematically structured online repository of evaluated best practices[2], complemented by a moderated learning community, to facilitate the two-way exchange of experience and practices on achieving climate neutrality between the cities under the Cities Mission and cities worldwide. The goal is to accelerate learning, replicability and scaling-up of solutions by helping cities to learn from first movers and tailor their approach. As part of these activities, the platform will provide support as relevant to the cooperation and knowledge exchange actions of the global mission on Urban Transitions[3] set up under Mission Innovation. This will include coordination with the Commission and the Global Covenant of Mayors[4] as co-leads of the global mission.
The platform will also set up and curate an online database of advising and funding actions undertaken in EU Member States and Associated Countries (at national level, but also at regional and city level) to support the climate neutrality of non-European cities. The database will inventory as well the advising and funding opportunities at international level that could benefit cities in the Europe.
In the process, the platform will liaise as needed with the Mission Platform, the dedicated national mission networks [5] , relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as the Driving Urban Transitions to a sustainable future (DUT) partnership, and other relevant information and dissemination channels that can increase awareness on the global landscape for advising and funding in the field of urban climate neutrality.
In addition, the platform will communicate experiences and milestones under the mission to international audiences via regular and targeted communication campaigns and activities. This will include support to the Commission with the organisation of an annual event on the international outreach of the mission.
Under all these activities, the platform will take into account the work already done by global city networks such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, C40 Cities and the EU’s International Urban and Regional Cooperation Programme, by international and multilateral organisations such as the UN-Habitat, the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, by international associations such as ICLEI and by global initiatives such as the UN Race to Zero Campaign. Linkages should also be ensured with international networks that promote piloting activities such as the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) and with the initiatives for urban climate neutrality under the EU’s Neighborhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument.

This Framework Partnership Agreement aims at contributing to the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, hereafter referred to as the Cities Mission, and its objective of achieving 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030. This partnership will build on the precursor action funded through the Horizon 2020 Green Deal call topic LC-GD-1-2-2020: Towards climate-neutral and socially innovative cities[1]. The Framework Partnership Agreement will establish the necessary framework and collaboration for implementing and scaling up the one-stop-shop platform dedicated to the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, hereafter referred to as the Mission Platform. The Mission Platform will cater for the needs of all the cities that commit to the objectives of the Cities Mission and start the transition towards climate neutrality in a systemic and smart way, as they engage in the co-creation and subsequent implementation of a Climate City Contract, hereafter referred to as CCC. The Mission Platform will assist those cities that will be identified and selected as a result of the open Call for Expression of Interest which will be launched and managed by the European Commission during the last quarter of 2021[2]. Cities that are not yet able to commit to the Mission’s timeline but are willing to commit to accelerate their transition towards climate neutrality within the timeframe 2030 to 2035 following the Cities Mission basic principles, will also receive basic support from the Mission Platform.
The Framework Partnership Agreement is expected to create the framework conditions and engage the needed competencies to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Operation of a fully functional Mission Platform that provides a wide range of tailor-made services to up to 150 cities participating in the Mission. Services cover technical, regulatory, financial and socio-economic expertise as well as assistance for developing and implementing the CCC and should complement and scale-up existing services developed by the project funded under the Horizon 2020 Green Deal call topic LC-GD-1-2-2020: Towards climate-neutral and socially innovative cities.
Consolidated science-based indicators and a common monitoring, reporting and verification framework for the cities participating in the Mission. This should build upon existing methodologies, including those already developed in the action funded through the Horizon 2020 Green Deal call topic LC-GD-1-2-2020, while ensuring coherent use and reporting regularly on the progress of cities towards the CCC.
Smart and customised access for cities to the best available research, expertise, tools and technologies that can enable them to quickly identify and implement portfolios of innovative, high-impact interventions on a deep decarbonisation pathway.
Establish and follow a common CCC process for the cities participating in the Mission. Share experiences and good practices and engage in mutual learning, including through twinning opportunities open to a wide spectrum of cities such as those in disadvantaged and peripheral regions.
Calls for proposals are launched to support large-scale pilots for the deployment in participating Mission cities of systemic solutions working across functional silos and thematic areas (mobility, energy systems, built environment, industry, SMEs, material and resource flows, natural areas and nature-based solutins, cultural/social/financial/institutional systems, and accessible public spaces), in support of transforming systems.
Web-based services and assistance to cities that are not yet in a position to commit to climate neutrality by 2030, but are ready to commit to accelerate their transition to climate neutrality in line with the Cities Mission principles. These cities will have the option to co-create a CCC with all stakeholders that will commit the city to undertake in a systemic way all actions needed for reaching climate neutrality in the period 2030-2035.
Close coordination with the European Commission to ensure that advice and support provided to cities remains aligned to the latest policies and initiatives and makes full use of available tools and services provided or supported by the Commission.
Scope:
Building on the concept developed through the Horizon 2020 Green Deal call topic LC-GD-1-2-2020: Towards climate-neutral and socially innovative cities and on the setup of a one-stop-shop platform as a first building block for the Mission Platform, to provide advisory services to cities committing to the transition towards climate neutrality, the Commission calls for a Framework Partnership Agreement to establish the necessary framework and collaboration for scaling up and implementing the concept and activities of a Mission Platform and to fully integrate this platform into the Cities Mission. Partners should possess good knowledge and expertise in European urban programmes and initiatives, urban planning, technological innovation for climate neutrality, social innovation and stakeholder engagement, knowledge valorisation and transfer, and funding and financing programmes such as Horizon Europe, EU structural funds, EIB, EBRD etc. Partners should build on the experience developed by European and international umbrella organisations and networks such as the EIT-KICs, C40, Eurocities, CIVITAS, POLIS, ENoLL, Covenant of Mayors Europe/ Global Covenant of Mayors, European Digital Innovation Hubs, ICLEI etc.
The partners will be responsible for defining and enabling the framework conditions that will allow for the development of a fully-fledged Mission Platform that will be focused on delivering the Mission objective of achieving 100 climate neutral cities by 2030 and ensuring that these cities will act as innovation hubs for other European cities to follow, thus accelerating the transition to climate neutrality at city level. The Mission Platform will provide tailor-made services and targeted support for the cities participating in the Mission. It will also offer web-based assistance to European cities that are not yet ready to commit to climate neutrality by 2030, but are ready to commit to accelerate their transition in line with the Cities Mission principles.
Partners should develop a draft action plan to broadly address the main building blocks on which the FPA will operate, in particular: 1) Development, up-scaling of the concept of a Mission Platform and plan for the implementation of its associated services; 2) Co-creation of Climate City Contracts for the cities participating in the Mission; 3) Assistance and preparation of tailor-made investment plans, project preparation and finance for the cities participating in the Mission; 4) Launch and management of calls for large scale EU R&I demonstrators accelerating city climate-neutrality solutions.
The partnership will fulfil the following objectives:
to fully develop and scale up the concept of a Mission Platform as the main delivery mechanism of the Cities Mission, through a demand-driven approach catering for the needs of up to 150 cities, providing tailored assistance and services through technical, regulatory, financial and socio-economic expertise as well as support to cities for developing and implementing their CCC including related investment plans, drawing where appropriate on existing tools and resources developed by the Commission, and ensuring alignment with evolving European policy developments and actions;
to coordinate the group of cities embarking in the CCC process, defining and implementing a common framework for monitoring, reporting and verification of progress;
to further facilitate the sharing of experience, good practices and mutual learning between cities, including additional twinning opportunities, thus enabling participating cities to act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to follow in view of urban climate neutrality by 2050;
to provide web-based assistance to European cities that are not yet ready to commit to climate neutrality by 2030, but are ready to engage to accelerate their transition in accordance with the Cities Mission principles;
to launch large-scale pilots to act as demonstrators for the deployment of R&I and other off-the-shelf solutions with potential for scale-up, moving from singular, customised pilot programmes to city-wide initiatives, also replicated in other cities, thus accelerating their capacity to deliver on climate neutrality;
to establish cooperation and regular exchange, formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding, with the R&I projects that will be funded under the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission Work Programme in order to identify complementarities, avoid potential overlaps with the pilots supported by the Mission Platform and ensure synergies where relevant, to the benefit of the participating cities.
To ensure a stable framework for the development of the Mission Platform, to avoid disruptions in its services and to deliver sustained support to the time-bound objective of the Cities Mission to achieve 100 climate-neutral cities by 2030, only one Framework Partnership Agreement will be established. The cooperation between the European Commission and selected partners will have a duration of five years. It will cover the period 2022-2027, until the conclusion of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Contribution to the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, the Zero Pollution Action Plan, the Biodiversity Strategy, Fit for 55 Strategy, Circular Economy Action Plan, the Urban Agenda for the EU, the New Leipzig Charter, the European partnership on Driving Urban Transitions for a sustainable future (DUT) and the New European Bauhaus Initiative, in line with the European Green Deal ambition and objectives;
Transparent and efficient decision-making processes for people-centric urban planning and design for climate neutral cities achieved through innovative collaborative methods such as co-creation, living labs, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, collective intelligence and collaborative economy in combination with technological innovations, data-driven approaches and enhanced cross-sectoral integration;
Effective management of trade-offs and ownership of transformative changes through the engagement and empowerment of stakeholders, citizens and inhabitants, paying special attention to vulnerable and at-risk for precarity social groups and communities, including people with disabilities, older people and youth;
Innovative urban planning and design practices, harnessing, compiling and mainstreaming local knowledge, creativity, ingenuity and design quality, triggering behavioural and lifestyles changes and fostering co-created approaches, holistic responses to interlinked challenges within a city, and effective use of digital tools, such as Digital Twins, for solutions drawing on cross-domain data e.g. through data shared via data space for smart communities and sectoral data spaces;
Solutions that ensure a more equitable, just, synergetic and optimal use of urban spaces integrating well-balanced built/green/blue/accessible infrastructures and biodiversity-friendly nature-based solutions for attractive, circular, healthy, resilient, secure and liveable cities with thriving citizens, communities, ecosystems and biodiversity and reduced urban environmental footprint.
Scope:
Global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pandemic, pollution and irreversible depletion of natural resources demand cities to engage in urgent and decisive systemic transitions towards climate neutrality, sustainability and resilience in line with the European Green Deal.
Current urban planning and design practices, governance arrangements, business models and institutional settings tend to favour sectorial rather than systemic interventions that are in line with holistic urban ecosystem planning and policy agendas. This often results in the deployment of conflicting solutions and interventions, with wasteful use of investments and resources. However, the transition to climate neutrality will require significant reductions in GHG emissions across a range of sectors such as urban mobility, energy efficiency in buildings, water and waste management as well as the (re)design, adaption or retrofitting of urban spaces/cities, building stock and infrastructures along with the development of more efficient management strategies based on sensor data and novel analysis methods. Retrofitting of buildings is an opportunity to, simultaneously and in a cost-efficient way, improve aspects related to health, safety, accessibility and overall quality of life.
The overall aim of this topic is to support a diverse range of urban areas across Europe (e.g. small and medium sized, port cities, cities with different geographical, climatic, socioeconomic conditions, levels of preparedness etc.), their urban authorities, stakeholders and citizens to identify, plan, design, fund, roll out and replicate solutions and measures in order to achieve climate neutrality, sustainability and resilience and significantly reduce emissions across the most relevant sectors by 2030.
Long-term integrated, visionary, people-centric urban planning and design practices are needed to enable the transition toward just, sustainable, resilient and climate neutral cities. This requires the setup of new collaborative frameworks, novel inter-institutional settings and innovative services and tools harnessing local citizen knowledge, social innovation, new technologies and digitalisation to ensure cross-sectorial (e.g. infrastructures, transport, energy, water, built environment and natural environment) interventions, full engagement and informed participation of citizens and communities and trigger necessary behavioural and lifestyles changes.
Proposals should set up innovative urban planning and design practices that result in flexile building/design regulations and instruments, that harmonize high quality place making, mix-land use, compact urban fabrics and well-balanced densities with equitable access to amenities.
The new urban planning and design practices and tools should aim at climate neutrality and a significant reduction in emissions by 2030. They should also aim to respect the urban form and typology, its aesthetics, character and identity while facilitating circularity and the use of innovative and clean building technologies, materials and construction techniques, in line with the guiding principles of the European Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus initiative. The resulting practices and tools should seek to maximize the economic, social, environmental and health benefits for all groups and communities, including groups that are vulnerable to exclusion, while averting spatial segregation, urban sprawl, gentrification and real estate speculation and increasing resilience to climate related hazards.
Proposals should use as necessary existing or improved state-of-the-art tools and methods for visualising, modelling, predicting, stimulating and analysing scenarios, assessing feasibility and cost-effectiveness of solutions, integrating existing and emerging data and tools, including under relevant EU laws and initiatives (e.g. air quality plans, Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, local digital twins etc.). They should deliver evidence-based guidelines and practical recommendations for the effective and optimal use of urban planning and design practices.
In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU Biodiversity[1] and Climate Adaptation[2] strategies, the Circular Economy[3] and the Zero Pollution[4] plans, the portfolio of the proposed solutions should prioritize to the greatest extent possible the deployment of biodiversity-friendly nature-based solutions[5] and ecosystem-based approaches to harness their multi-beneficial, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, biodiversity, health and well-being enhancing potential.
Each action must envisage pilot demonstrations in at least four cities[6] situated each in different Member States or Associated Countries together with at least four replication/follower cities, to demonstrate how inclusive, accessible (including for persons with disabilities), integrated, cross-sectoral and creative human-centred planning can be optimally deployed to develop and implement their climate action plans to achieve the climate neutrality and GHG reduction objectives by the set timeline. This should include (re)designing, adapting or retrofitting urban spaces/cities, building stock, neighbourhoods or districts and infrastructures that urban authorities commit to implement during the life of the project to achieve sustainability, resilience and climate neutrality, and drastically reduce their GHG emissions by 2030 as compared to an agreed baseline established at the start of the project to enable monitoring and assessment of the progress.
A strong and transparent monitoring system using established tools, practices, methodologies and agreed KPIs, and the advisory services of the Mission Platform[7] should be established to measure and monitor progress.
The replication/follower cities[8] should be each situated in different Member States or Associated Countries and should commit to a strategy of climate neutrality as soon as possible and of course no later than 2050. They must be fully involved in the project from the beginning and commit sufficient resources to develop under the guidance and mentoring of the leading cities and deliver by the end of the life of the project their integrated, inclusive, and cross-sectorial urban planning and design to achieve climate neutrality, sustainability and resilience and significantly reduce GHG emissions across the most relevant sectors as soon as possible, and no later than 2050. Unlike for the leading cities, actual deployment of the solutions during the life of the project is not expected from the replication/follower cities.
Actions and applicant cities will be assessed according to the dedicated support to replication/follower cities and the level of their ambition and commitment for inclusiveness in the co-created planning and design elaboration processes and the actual deployment during the life of the project of the solutions jointly decided during this process. To this end, actions should provide the necessary evidence, such as commitment letters by the competent urban authorities that they will honour the planning decisions and commit necessary financial resources for their implementation during the life of the project.
To facilitate replication, upscaling and up-taking of the generated outcomes and to foster capacity building/upskilling of public authorities, local actors and communities, actions should engage in ambitious outreach, communication, dissemination and training activities in coordination and complementarity with the Mission Platform.
To facilitate replication and reuse of the solutions developed as part of these actions, use of open source software, open standards and technical specifications [9] re-use of building blocks and interoperability solutions[10] and sharing data through EU data spaces are encouraged if and where appropriate.
Actions should explore opportunities and plan, undertake and report on activities for synergies, collaboration, clustering and possibly twinning activities with other relevant like-minded projects funded under this topic and other relevant topics in this and future Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission (hereafter referred to as the Cities Mission) work programmes and calls and initiatives undertaken by the Mission Platform, the European partnership on Driving Urban Transitions for a sustainable future (DUT), the upcoming European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Urban Agenda for the EU[11], Living-in.eu and the New European Bauhaus Initiative as well as smart specialisation partnerships in relevant areas.
The projects funded under this topic must establish a collaboration agreement, to identify clear links among themselves and ensure complementarity, coordination and exchange on relevant linked activities. The selected projects should also foresee active collaboration with relevant and related projects funded under this call in order to address synergies and complementarities between the projects of the Cities Mission portfolio. In particular collaboration with the Mission Platform (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) is essential and projects should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the workplan. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined at a second stage during the lifetime of the projects. The collaboration with the Mission Platform should be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the projects starting date.
Inter- and trans-disciplinary consortia combining expertise and capacity from public authorities, urban stakeholders, infrastructure providers, knowledge institutions, planners, cultural and creative organizations, entrepreneurs, societal actors and citizens are necessary to address the challenges of this topic. Inclusion of social sciences and humanities, behavioural sciences and gender issues as well as expertise in planning and design is essential.
To support project implementation, applicants may seek possibilities of involving the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in order to valorise the relevant expertise and physical facilities of JRC in demonstrating and testing energy, buildings and mobility applications at the JRC living labs and research infrastructures.

The ‘European Universities’ initiative is part of the ‘Partnerships for Excellence’ support provided in the framework of the new Erasmus+ Programme. This initiative has an ambitious mandate aimed to trigger and deepen unprecedented levels of institutional cooperation between higher education institutions, making it systemic, structural and sustainable. It aims to encourage the emergence of bottom-up alliances of universities across Europe, which will enable students to combine studies in several countries.
In line with the priorities of the European Education Area by 2025, these European Universities intend to:
• Promote common European values and a strengthened European identity by bringing together a new generation of Europeans able to cooperate within different cultures, languages, and across borders, sectors and academic disciplines;
• Reach a substantial leap in quality, performance, attractiveness and competitiveness of European higher education institutions, and contribute to the European knowledge economy, employment, creativity, culture and welfare by making the best use of innovative pedagogies and striving to make the knowledge square a reality. ‘European Universities’ will be key drivers to boost the quality of higher education and where possible to strengthen its link to the research and innovation landscape in Europe and its outreach towards the society and economy.
To achieve this, the present call Topic ERASMUS-EDU-2022-EUR-UNIV-1 (Topic 1) will provide support for already existing deep institutional transnational cooperation alliances , including – but not limited to - European Universities alliances selected under the 2019 Erasmus+ call for proposals (EAC/A03/2018). The aim is to build upon the institutional cooperation achieved so far and to further deepen, intensify and expand the effectiveness of this existing cooperation to advance the higher education transformation process towards fully fledged ‘European Universities’."

JEAN MONNET ACTIONS IN THE FIELD OF HIGHER EDUCATION

The Jean Monnet Action in the field of Higher Education supports Teaching and research in the field of European Union studies worldwide.
By EU studies it is meant the study of Europe in its entirety, with particular emphasis on the EU dimension, from an internal but also from a global perspective.
The scope of EU studies can be varied so long as the EU angle is explored.
EU studies should promote active European citizenship and values and deal with the role of the EU in a globalised world, enhancing awareness of the Union and facilitating future engagement as well as people-to-people dialogue.
The Jean Monnet Action also strive to function as a vector of public diplomacy towards third countries, promoting EU values and enhancing the visibility of what the European Union stands for and what it intends to achieve.
The objectives and criteria to apply for Teaching and research are described below.

TEACHING AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
The Jean Monnet “Teaching and Research” actions will:
promote excellence in teaching and research in the field of European Union studies worldwide;  foster the dialogue between the academic world and society, including local and state level policy-makers, civil servants, civil society actors, representatives of the different levels of education and of the media;  generate knowledge and insights in support of EU policy-making and strengthen the role of the EU within Europe and in a globalised world;  reach out to a wider public and spread knowledge about the EU to the wider society (beyond academia and specialised audiences) bringing the EU closer to the public.
The action also strives to function as a vector for public diplomacy towards partner countries, promoting EU values and enhancing the visibility of what the European Union actually stands for and what it intends to achieve.
Jean Monnet Centres of Excellence (CoE) are focal points of competence and knowledge on European Union subjects. They should gather the expertise and competences of high-level experts aiming to at develop synergies between the various disciplines and resources in European studies (as described above) as well as at creating joint transnational activities, they also ensure openness to civil society. Jean Monnet Centres of Excellence have a major role in reaching out to students from faculties not normally dealing with European Union issues as well as to policy makers, civil servants, organised civil society and the general public at large."

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Active participation of social innovation actors in innovation ecosystems, by ensuring their interlinking and connection with all other actors, including the SMEs and start-ups, accelerators and business incubators, industry, investors, philanthropy societies and the public sector, with the aim to ensure access to their entrepreneurial knowledge and skills required to run successful projects;
Wider access to alternative means of financing social innovations achieved by promoting its impact and mobilising a broad range of partners;
Tested innovation models with potential of scaling up and replicability, and that are available for widespread use, possibly through the policy actions.
Scope:
Target group(s): Social innovation actors/social entrepreneurs[1], SMEs, start-ups, accelerators and business incubators, investors, industry, foundations and philanthropy societies, universities and RTOs public-owned enterprises.
The action aims to raise awareness and ease the access of social entrepreneurs to the resources of pan-European, national, regional and local innovation ecosystems. In addition, the action aims to have a lasting spill-over effect by bringing attention to the benefits of social innovation projects to the society as a whole, and to strategic priorities and objectives of the Commission in particular.
The proposals should focus on the following activities:
the transfer of knowledge and building capacities among the innovation actors (including universities, accelerators and incubators, networks of start-ups), so that they would be better equipped to work with the social entrepreneurs; examples may include: activities aiming at creating and improving connections of social entrepreneurs to stakeholders in innovation ecosystems (e.g. gathering, production and diffusion of relevant information materials), study visits and exchange of good practices, training activities, webinars, seminars, conferences, etc., developing business support services for social entrepreneurs (e.g. toolkits, templates, manuals and other support material), awareness raising activities among the network’s members and towards the wider audience, engagement of social entrepreneurs in business and entrepreneurial skills and knowledge enforcement trainings;
creation and/or connection of social innovation hubs/centres of excellence; integration of social innovation dimension to existing tech-oriented hubs;
detection of possible innovation models with potential of scaling and replicability at national, regional, and local level. Although one size does not fit all, the examples of social innovator’s scaling path may help public authorities to design and implement new evidence-based policies; help in detecting the local partners (e.g. other organisation and/or individuals – micro franchisees) to deploy the model;
creation or utilization of the already existing open platform that use digital technologies to connect a global network of social entrepreneurs to promote the best practices, alternative financing opportunities and improve their skills.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Social Innovation
[1]Social entrepreneurship is an approach by individuals, groups, start-up companies or entrepreneurs, in which they develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues. This concept may be applied to a wide range of organisations, which vary in size, aims, and beliefs.

","11 January 2022
","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased inclusiveness by enlarging the participation of more diverse innovation actors and broaden the participation among EU and Associated Countries territories, in already existing successful initiatives and networks that interconnect European innovation ecosystems and promote the deployment and scale-up of innovative solutions;
Reduce the innovation divide in Europe and reinforce the innovation aspect of the European Research Area[1] in the areas of inclusiveness and connectivity, improving the innovation capacities of Member States and Associated Countries and enabling them to engage in joint efforts for sustainable growth and economic development[2].
Scope:
Target group(s): Public national, regional and/or local authorities, private organisations, public-owned enterprises, professional associations, clusters, accelerators, innovation hubs, incubators, technology parks, and/or any other representatives that lead initiatives/networks that support the deployment of innovation.
The topic aims to increase Europe’s innovation efficiency and capacity via expanding the cooperation and enlarging the participation of more diverse innovation stakeholders and territories in existing successful initiatives and networks that support innovation deployment in Member States, Associated Countries, at national, regional and/or local level.
In Europe, there are various excellent and well-established initiatives and/or networks that support innovation deployment and foster value co-creation via interconnected flows of information, knowledge and talent. However, some innovation-related stakeholders and EU and Associated Countries’ territories are not aware of them, the nature of their activities, ways to get involved, and support they offer. Despite serious efforts deployed at national, regional and European level[3], the EU sees too many innovation actors to still miss from the innovation ecosystems (including investors, foundations, public and private buyers, social innovators, civil society organisations non-governmental organisations, as well as women-innovators), and significant internal disparities exist in terms of innovation performance at territorial level. The widening countries[4] are among those that are lagging behind; most of them being moderate and modest innovators[5].
To tap into Europe’s yet unexploited innovation potential, greater involvement of all innovation actors and EU and Associated Countries’ territories who are moderate and modest innovators can be instrumental and networking and connection with partners across Europe is imperative. In addition, inclusive ecosystems should also be more gender-responsive, fostering the participation of women innovators, as well as taking into consideration overall gender equality and diversity objectives in the innovation initiatives developed[6].
The proposals should:
present the existing initiatives and/or networks, their role and activities towards uniting, and representing a bigger ecosystem of stakeholders with a joint clearly defined purpose to support key stakeholders, including SMEs and start-ups towards innovation deployment; potential initiatives and/or networks that will be supported may include, inter alia, clusters, accelerators, innovation hubs and platforms;
demonstrate that they successfully operate in Europe and explain the reasons for which they are considered to be successful in supporting innovation deployment;
describe the process applicants plan to follow in order to implement a solid “opening-up” strategy of the initiatives and/or networks they represent, with the aim:
to increase the participation of more diverse innovation stakeholders currently missing or underrepresented within and among territories;
to enlarge and broaden the participation and enhance the commitment for involvement of more EU and Associated Countries; applicants are thus encouraged to facilitate collaborative links with moderate and modest innovators from these countries;
explain how expansion to new territories and/or inclusion of new stakeholders would bring added value both at initiative/network level and at EU level;
describe the proposed activities to achieve the topic outcomes, including:
ways to better identify the specific needs of key innovation stakeholders, including start-ups and SMEs, as well as the participating countries and/or regions in order to allow the customization of the provided services by the network/initiatives; this may include surveys, studies and data/intelligence/market analysis where necessary;
design and development of joint strategies and/or new supporting services, tools and resources to facilitate and expand the support provided to innovation stakeholders (including high-quality start-ups and SMEs), training and soft skills development, networking and coordination structures and tools to facilitate innovation development, as well as tools for the access to and sharing of best practices, resources, knowledge, talents, markets, expertise, and services, common knowledge assets, mutual learning and exchanges of best practices, the design of pilot schemes with the view of filling possible gaps in relation to the provided services, and promoting gender balanced participation;
joint awareness raising and communication campaigns to reach out to more stakeholders in different territories;
present the variety of involved stakeholders (e.g. universities, investors, public and private buyers, foundations, social innovators and women-led businesses, civil society organisations) and the new ones that they bring in, in comparison to their current and other initiatives with a proper justification on the need for their involvement;
explain the diversion of involved Member States and Associated Countries with the participation of legal entities from countries and/or regions that are moderate and modest innovators; provide information on how this could help those lagging behind in terms of innovation performance to attain a competitive position in the European and global value chains;
demonstrate the complementarity and encourage the alignment of the proposed initiatives/networks with other national and/or regional and/or local policies and strategies, including the smart specialisation strategies.

Purpose of the action
Following the recent pandemic, the need for innovation in our education and training systems, as well as youth, has never been so great. Innovation in teaching and learning is crucial, at individual level as well as at institutional level. These innovative approaches should not only provide today’s and tomorrow’s workers with the appropriate skills for rapidly-changing labour markets, but should also arm today’s and tomorrow’s workforce with creativity and skills to confront the growing complexity of societal challenges that we all face such as climate change, the protection of biodiversity, clean energy, public health, digitalization and automation, artificial intelligence, robotics and data analysis.
This action will aim to foster innovation, creativity and participation, as well as social entrepreneurship in different fields of education and training, within sectors or across sectors and disciplines.
Forward-Looking Projects are large-scale projects that aim to identify, develop, test and/or assess innovative (policy) approaches that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed, thus improving education and training systems. They will support forward-looking ideas responding to key European priorities and that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed and giving input for improving education, training and youth systems, as well as to bring a substantial innovative effect in terms of methods and practices to all types of learning and active participation settings for Europe's social cohesion.
The goal is to support transnational cooperation projects implementing a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral
or cross-sectoral activities that either:
foster innovation in terms of scope, ground-breaking methods and practices, and/or
ensure a transfer of innovation (across countries, policy sectors or target groups), thus ensuring at European level a sustainable exploitation of innovative project results and/or transferability into different contexts and audiences.
The partnerships should be composed of a mix of public and private organisations combining researchers, practitioners and partners with the capacity to reach policy-makers.
Forward-Looking Projects should therefore be implemented by a mixed partnership of organisations:
based on excellence and state of the art knowledge,
having the capacity to innovate,
able to generate systemic impact through their activities and the potential to drive the policy agenda in the fields of education and training.
Supported projects will aim at achieving systemic impact at European level by having the capacity to deploy their innovative outcomes on a European scale and/or by being able to transfer them into different thematic or geographical contexts.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
Forward-Looking Projects should always have in mind the following cross-cutting policy contexts:
1. The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan;
2. The European Commission’s Green Deal, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris
Declaration on Climate Change;
3. The European Skills Agenda – in particular action 1 on the Pact for Skills, action 6 on Skills to support the
twin transitions, and action 8 on Skills for life;
4. The Council Recommendation on vocational education and training (VET) for sustainable competitiveness,
social fairness and resilience;
5. The Council Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults;
6. Digital Transformation in our education and training systems, as well as in youth, as encompassed in the
European Commission’s Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027.
LOT 1: CROSS-SECTORAL PRIORITIES
Proposals submitted under Lot 1 must address one of the following 2 priorities:
Priority 1: Supporting high quality and inclusive digital education, in line with the Digital Education Action Plan
Education and training systems are currently undergoing a deep digital transformation, which is being driven by advances in connectivity; the widespread use of devices and digital applications; the need for individual flexibility, the wider availability of and need for high-quality digital education content and the ever-increasing demand for digital skills. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has heavily impacted education and training, has accelerated the change and provided multiple new learning experiences and perspectives. The Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027 sets the EU policy for the digital transformation in education and training over the next programming period. The Digital Education Action Plan has two strategic priorities:
Supporting the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem (1)
Addressing the need to enhance digital competences for the digital transformation (2)
There is a need to equip all learners with digital competences (knowledge, skills and attitudes) to live, work, learn and thrive in a world increasingly mediated by digital technologies. Digital technology, when deployed skilfully and effectively by educators, can fully support the agenda of high quality and inclusive education and training for all learners. Technology can be a powerful and engaging tool for collaborative and creative learning. It can help learners and educators access, create and share digital content. Effective digital capacity planning and development is vital for education and training systems. This requires the development and ongoing review and updating of digital strategies addressing technology gaps in infrastructure, devices and developing relevant organisational capabilities in education, including the capacity to deliver hybrid modes of learning and teaching (remote and on-site). In this context, increasing our knowledge and understanding of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its ethical educational deployment also becomes important. Capacity should be developed to ensure accessibility to assistive technologies and accessible digital content and more generally address unequal access, e.g. on socio economic or ruralurban grounds. High-quality digital education content, user-friendly tools, value-adding services and secure platforms that maintain privacy and uphold ethical standards are essential for high quality and inclusive digital education.
In addition to the two strategic priorities outlined above, the Digital Education Action Plan sets out to support more effective cooperation on digital education and training at EU level through the set-up of a European Digital Education Hub. The Hub will promote cross-sectoral collaboration, identify and share good practice and support Member States and the education and training sector with tools, frameworks, guidance, technical expertise and research in the domain of digital education. The Hub should link national and regional digital education initiatives and actors and support new models for exchange of digital education content, addressing issues such as common standards, interoperability, accessibility and quality-assurance. The Hub should thus also be taken into account in the scope of the areas set out below.
Forward-Looking Projects will address specifically at least one of the three following areas under Priority 1:
A) Key success factors for inclusive and high-quality digital education and training.
Projects will:
Identify and/or assess enabling factors or obstacles for effective and performing digital education and training ecosystems. These enabling factors and obstacles may be addressed at systemic (national/regional/local level) or at organisational level;
Examine the interplay between these factors/obstacles and produce recommendations that may be disseminated and exploited at organisational and systemic level;
Note: Factors like education and training systems’ structure and organisation, national curriculum approaches, national assessment of educational performance, teacher/trainer training strategies as well as infrastructure and connectivity are expected to be examined, but also the possibility for other hidden factors as well.
B) Artificial Intelligence in education
Projects will:
Identify, develop and pilot use cases of artificial intelligence in education and training including considering their impact on data, privacy, ethics and EU values;
Produce recommendations, toolkits and implementation guidelines on the role and use of artificial intelligence in education and training that may be disseminated and exploited at organisational and systemic level.
C) High-quality digital education content
Projects will:
Identify, develop and pilot use cases for the development and adoption of high-quality digital education content (taking into account the need for high-quality instructional design, accessibility, recognition and multilingualism and reflecting the need for interoperability, certification, verification and transferability of digital education content);
Produce recommendations, toolkits and implementation guidelines on the development and adoption of highquality digital education content that may be disseminated and exploited at organisational and systemic level.
Priority 2: Supporting education and training systems to adapt for the green transition
The European Green Deal highlights the importance of mobilising the education and training sector to support the transition to a greener and more sustainable Europe. There is a need to support collective and individual action level through the development of knowledge, skills and attitudes related to sustainability and empowering learners to become agents of change. Education and training systems and institutions can be catalysts for achieving this change.
One of the six dimensions of the European Education Area and the sixth flagship action of the European Skills Agenda focuses specifically on supporting the green transition. In addition, the Education for Climate Coalition, launched by the European Commission on 10 December 2020, aims to mobilise expertise, provide resources for networking and support creative approaches to climate action and sustainability, involving teachers, pupils and students. The goal of the Coalition is to link bottom-up initiatives and EU level action and to support pledges and concrete actions to change sustainability behaviour across the EU.
In addition, the Commission is set to propose end 2021 a Council Recommendation on education for environmental sustainability. This will aim to support Member States to embed sustainability in education and training systems and boost cooperation and exchange of experiences at European level on learning for sustainability. The Commission is also developing a European Competence Framework to help develop and assess knowledge, skills and attitudes on sustainability.
All these actions aim at helping people acquire knowledge, abilities, values and attitudes needed to live in, develop and support a sustainable and resource-efficient economy and society.
Forward-Looking Projects will address at least one of the three following areas under Priority 2:
A) Promoting whole institution approaches to sustainability
Projects will focus on:
Designing, implementing and monitoring whole-institution sustainability plans, including through the use of self-assessment tools;
Supporting education leaders (e.g. through professional development, mentoring schemes, networking initiatives) to embed sustainability into all aspects of the institutions’ operations;
Supporting student and staff involvement in sustainability initiatives, e.g. through sustainability champions/ambassadors, developing links with local community groups and other partners beyond the education institution;
Designing, implementing and monitoring approaches related to sustainable operations on the school/campus site, e.g. energy and water consumption; mobility and transport; greening of teaching and learning environment and infrastructure.
B) Developing the skills and competences of learners and educators related to sustainability
Projects will focus on:
Designing, implementing and monitoring innovative approaches to teaching and training on sustainability, which could include the effective use of digital technologies to support learning for sustainability;
Building the capacity of educators (teachers, training and all educational staff) to integrate sustainability through professional development, including supporting educators with innovative teaching practices and bridging subjects in different disciplines;
Connecting different education sectors on sustainability competence development, including formal and nonformal education;
Awareness-raising activities, including activities targeted at the fight against disinformation (related to, e.g., green washing) and fostering critical-thinking through for example hands-on learning in ‘makerspaces’ and/or ‘STEAM’ learning approaches.
C) Empowering citizens to act on sustainability, the environment and climate change, including in the context of the new Education for Climate Coalition
Projects will focus on:
Designing concrete and replicable “climate action plans” at local level, involving learners, teachers, trainers, education leaders, local business, museums, art and science bodies and sport centres;
Designing project-based, experiential learning led by schools with parents, local businesses, the wider community, e.g.: promoting healthy eating; promoting schools as green, sustainable, interactive buildings, in line with the New European Bauhaus priorities; promoting cross-fertilisation between green schools, as physical structures, and all the other elements of a learning environment such as innovative pedagogies, project-based learning and cross-subject teacher teams;
Supporting innovative partnerships between formal education (e.g. schools, higher education institutions etc.) and non-formal actors (e.g. NGOs, environmental centres, libraries, museums, etc.).
Applications can target one or more sectors of education, from Early Childhood Education and Care through to adult
learning as well as formal, non-formal and informal education. Applications that address more than one area within a
priority will not receive extra points during evaluation.

Purpose of the action
Following the recent pandemic, the need for innovation in our education and training systems, as well as youth, has never been so great. Innovation in teaching and learning is crucial, at individual level as well as at institutional level. These innovative approaches should not only provide today’s and tomorrow’s workers with the appropriate skills for rapidly-changing labour markets, but should also arm today’s and tomorrow’s workforce with creativity and skills to confront the growing complexity of societal challenges that we all face such as climate change, the protection of biodiversity, clean energy, public health, digitalization and automation, artificial intelligence, robotics and data analysis.
This action will aim to foster innovation, creativity and participation, as well as social entrepreneurship in different fields of education and training, within sectors or across sectors and disciplines.
Forward-Looking Projects are large-scale projects that aim to identify, develop, test and/or assess innovative (policy) approaches that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed, thus improving education and training systems. They will support forward-looking ideas responding to key European priorities and that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed and giving input for improving education, training and youth systems, as well as to bring a substantial innovative effect in terms of methods and practices to all types of learning and active participation settings for Europe's social cohesion.
The goal is to support transnational cooperation projects implementing a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities that either:
foster innovation in terms of scope, ground-breaking methods and practices, and/or
ensure a transfer of innovation (across countries, policy sectors or target groups), thus ensuring at European level a sustainable exploitation of innovative project results and/or transferability into different contexts and audiences.
The partnerships should be composed of a mix of public and private organisations combining researchers, practitioners and partners with the capacity to reach policy-makers.
Forward-Looking Projects should therefore be implemented by a mixed partnership of organisations:
based on excellence and state of the art knowledge,
having the capacity to innovate,
able to generate systemic impact through their activities and the potential to drive the policy agenda in the fields of education and training.
Supported projects will aim at achieving systemic impact at European level by having the capacity to deploy their innovative outcomes on a European scale and/or by being able to transfer them into different thematic or geographical contexts.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
Forward-Looking Projects should always have in mind the following cross-cutting policy contexts:
1. The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan;
2. The European Commission’s Green Deal, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris
Declaration on Climate Change;
3. The European Skills Agenda – in particular action 1 on the Pact for Skills, action 6 on Skills to support the
twin transitions, and action 8 on Skills for life;
4. The Council Recommendation on vocational education and training (VET) for sustainable competitiveness,
social fairness and resilience;
5. The Council Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults;
6. Digital Transformation in our education and training systems, as well as in youth, as encompassed in the
European Commission’s Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027.
LOT 2: VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING (VET)
Proposals submitted under Lot 2 must address one of the following 3 priorities:
Priority 3: Supporting the Pact for Skills
The Pact for Skills is the first flagship action of the 2020 European Skills Agenda. It is a new engagement model for
addressing skills challenges and deliver on the recovery path, the EU Industrial Strategy and the green and digital transitions. It mobilises and incentivises all relevant stakeholders to take concrete actions for the upskilling and reskilling of people of working age, in particular by pooling efforts in wide partnerships. The Pact is firmly anchored in the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights and supports the goals of the Green Deal and the digital transformation, as set out in the Commission communication “A strong Social Europe for Just Transitions”.
Among others, the Pact aims to mobilise and incentivise large companies, in cooperation with other stakeholders to support (in the context of upskilling and reskilling) micro-, small and medium-sized companies.
The purpose of this priority is to identify, test, develop or assess tools or structures focused on brokering and building cooperation between large companies and micro, small and medium companies (SMEs) along a value chain in the same industrial ecosystem with the involvement of other players relevant for up- and reskilling. The objective of this cooperation must be the upskilling and reskilling of people at working age in a particular value chain or industrial ecosystem. The projects could also serve the purpose of laying the ground for large-scale skills partnerships in industrial ecosystems.
The tools or structures should have potential of becoming mainstreamed and giving input for improving education and training systems and other opportunities for skills anticipation, development and validation. Project should involve relevant stakeholders, such as, VET providers, higher education institutions, public and private employment services, innovative hubs, social partners, companies and public authorities.
The cooperation tools or structures should improve quality, efficiency and equity of upskilling and reskilling opportunities for people at working age and adapt them for the changing tasks in micro-, small or medium-sized enterprises.
The tools or structures could include cooperation with public authorities (e.g. regional or national), VET providers, social partners and other stakeholders to improve the sustainability of the solutions and include impact on education and training systems.
Priority 4: Structures and mechanisms for Applied research in VET
Applied research is usually defined as original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, directed primarily towards a specific, practical aim or objective. The results of applied research are intended primarily to be valid for possible applications to products, operations, methods or systems. Applied research gives operational form to ideas. It is very closely related to the concept of “Experimental development” which is defined as systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.
Applied research has a strong focus on solving real-world problems in industry. A distinguishing characteristic of applied research in VET is the sector’s potential to bring together research and innovation, with the dual aims of understanding industry’s problems and bringing about change in the workplace. The skills required to create and diffuse knowledge overlap. Both call for inquiry, reflective practice, communication and collaboration.
Another feature of VET applied research is the close link between research and efforts to improve VET pedagogy. These endeavours can lead to innovative thinking, new teaching practices and training products, and ultimately more creative graduates.
The Council Recommendation on vocational education and training (VET) for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience, calls for the establishment of Centres of Vocational Excellence, acting “…as catalysts for local business investment, supporting recovery, green and digital transitions, European and regional innovation and smart specialisation strategies, development of vocational education and training, including at higher qualification levels (EQF levels 5-8) in line with national context and provide innovative services such as clusters and business incubators for start-ups and technology innovation for SMEs, as well as innovative reskilling solutions …”;
Among their key activities Centres of VET excellence aim at:
Working together with local SME's through innovation hubs, technology diffusion centres, prototyping and applied research projects, with the involvement of VET learners and staff;
Contributing to creation and dissemination of new knowledge in partnership with other stakeholders, e.g. through open innovation, joint research and development (R&D) with universities, companies, and other research institutes, etc.
The Osnabrück Declaration on vocational education and training as an enabler of recovery and just transitions to digital and green economies, calls for support at EU level to “ Develop and strengthen centres of vocational excellence as innovative incubators and skills ecosystems encompassing learning, training and research activities…”.
In many countries applied research has led to stimulate innovation in companies, in particular in micro and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), as well as the continuous improvement and innovation in VET teaching and training practices. By being actively engaged in applied research with local companies, VET providers become co-creators of local innovation eco-systems. The do so by contributing to the generation of new and improved products, services and processes, but also through the supply of skilled, innovative and entrepreneurial VET graduates.
The projects will:
Identify, assess, test, and develop structures and mechanisms for applied research in VET, to broaden its engagement in R&D and innovation systems;
Build the capacity of VET systems with the close involvement of teachers and trainers, as well as VET learners, to undertake applied research and manage innovation projects together with other organisations, and in particular SMEs;
Based on its experience and outcomes, the project will propose a reference framework (operational and financial) aimed at mainstreaming applied research and experimental development in VET provision, making use of private as well as public (national and EU) funding instruments.
The results of these projects should have the potential to be mainstreamed, and contribute to the modernisation of VET systems and their engagement in applied research and experimental development, while providing learners with opportunities for challenge/project based learning.
Priority 5: Green skills in the VET sector
The European Green Deal is Europe’s new growth strategy aiming to transform its economy and society and to put them on a more sustainable path. As stipulated in Action 6 of the European Skills Agenda, the Commission will support the acquisition of skills for the green transition.
A fair and successful green transition requires investments in skills of people to increase the number of professionals who (i) build and master green technologies, including digital ones, (ii) develop green products, services and business models, (iii) create innovative nature-based solutions and (iv) help minimise the environmental footprint of activities. It also requires retraining and upskilling of the workforce to accompany labour market transitions and mobility. This is necessary because job creation and job losses will not necessarily happen in the same sectors, and across the economy task profiles and skill requirements will change fundamentally. In addition, Europe will only become a climate neutral continent, a resource efficient society and a circular economy with an informed population and workforce that understands how to think and act green.
VET institutions are well placed to provide the skills needed for a successful green transition, both through initial and continuing VET programmes. The Council Recommendation on vocational education and training for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience also aims to make VET a driver for innovation and growth preparing people with the skills for the digital and green transitions and occupations in high demand. This includes expansion of the training offer fostering the acquisition of entrepreneurial, digital and green skills.
The Osnabrück Declaration on vocational education and training as an enabler of recovery and just transitions to digital and green economies calls for:
Promoting initiatives to support cooperation and knowledge-sharing between VET institutions and providers on learning methods, curricula, guidelines, work-based learning, and quality assurance of education and training offer on green skills, by using European programmes like Erasmus+;
Defining labour-market-relevant skills for the green transition that are to be incorporated in curricula and VET provision, including basic skills across all sectors and occupations and sector specific skills in cooperation with the social partners.
The projects will address both of the following two areas under Priority 5:
A) Set of core green skills for the labour market
- Develop a set of core green skills for the labour market across different economic sectors to guide training with a view to creating a generation of climate, environment and health conscious professionals and green economic operators.
B) Integrating this set into VET
- Projects will help integrate this set of core green skills into VET curricula.
- Projects will also help integrate this set into the training of teachers, trainers and other staff undertaking initial and continuing professional development.

Purpose of the action
Following the recent pandemic, the need for innovation in our education and training systems, as well as youth, has never been so great. Innovation in teaching and learning is crucial, at individual level as well as at institutional level. These innovative approaches should not only provide today’s and tomorrow’s workers with the appropriate skills for rapidly-changing labour markets, but should also arm today’s and tomorrow’s workforce with creativity and skills to confront the growing complexity of societal challenges that we all face such as climate change, the protection of biodiversity, clean energy, public health, digitalization and automation, artificial intelligence, robotics and data analysis.
This action will aim to foster innovation, creativity and participation, as well as social entrepreneurship in different fields of education and training, within sectors or across sectors and disciplines.
Forward-Looking Projects are large-scale projects that aim to identify, develop, test and/or assess innovative (policy) approaches that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed, thus improving education and training systems. They will support forward-looking ideas responding to key European priorities and that have the potential of becoming mainstreamed and giving input for improving education, training and youth systems, as well as to bring a substantial innovative effect in terms of methods and practices to all types of learning and active participation settings for Europe's social cohesion.
The goal is to support transnational cooperation projects implementing a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities that either:
foster innovation in terms of scope, ground-breaking methods and practices, and/or
ensure a transfer of innovation (across countries, policy sectors or target groups), thus ensuring at European level a sustainable exploitation of innovative project results and/or transferability into different contexts and audiences.
The partnerships should be composed of a mix of public and private organisations combining researchers, practitioners and partners with the capacity to reach policy-makers.
Forward-Looking Projects should therefore be implemented by a mixed partnership of organisations:
based on excellence and state of the art knowledge,
having the capacity to innovate,
able to generate systemic impact through their activities and the potential to drive the policy agenda in the fields of education and training.
Supported projects will aim at achieving systemic impact at European level by having the capacity to deploy their innovative outcomes on a European scale and/or by being able to transfer them into different thematic or geographical contexts.
Lot 3: Adult education (AE)
These projects support the implementation of the principles and objectives of the European Pillar of Social Rights
Action Plan, the European Skills Agenda, and the Council Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults.

social fairness and resilience;
5. The Council Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults;
6. Digital Transformation in our education and training systems, as well as in youth, as encompassed in the
European Commission’s Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027.
LOT 3: ADULT EDUCATION (AE)
Proposals submitted under Lot 3 must address the following priority:
Priority 6: Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults
Upskilling Pathways as defined in the Council Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults, targets adults with a low level of skills, knowledge and competences who have at best completed lower secondary education. It aims to provide adults with flexible opportunities to improve their literacy, numeracy and digital skills (including ability to use digital technologies) and to progress towards higher qualification levels relevant for the labour market and for active participation in society.
Upskilling Pathways contribute to ensure that everyone has the right to quality and inclusive education, training and life-long learning, as defined in Principle 1 of the European Pillar of Social Rights.
Upskilling Pathways comprises three steps:
1. skills assessment (i.e. skills identification or screening);
2. provision of a tailored, flexible and quality learning offer; and
3. validation and recognition of skills acquired.
Through the actions proposed, the projects will support the implementation of the Council Recommendation on Upskilling Pathways, the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan, as well as to the European Skills Agenda (action 8 ‘Skills for life’).
The projects will:
Contribute to increase the supply of upskilling opportunities and their take up by low skilled adults;
Contribute to practical and integrated delivery of the Upskilling Pathways steps supported by outreach and guidance measures;
Contribute to increase the coherence among existing measures for low skilled adults;
Ensure that all relevant actors are mobilised and engaged in the delivery of the Upskilling Pathways Recommendation.
A partnership approach should be ensured, which promotes effective coordination and long-term collaboration between the stakeholders involved in planning, implementing and monitoring Upskilling Pathways.
The projects shall include a plan for the roll-out of its outcomes/results in the participating countries, and include proposals for the further development of tailored support and learning for this specific target group.
Actors involved in Upskilling Pathways may include: national, regional or local entities involved in planning, organising or promoting adult learning, employer organisations, employers, trade unions, chambers of industry, trade, commerce and crafts, employment services, education and training providers, intermediary and sectoral organisations, civil society organisations, local and regional economic actors, libraries and community services.

Expected Impact:
EXPECTED IMPACT
Forward-Looking Projects intend to provide innovative solutions that can be mainstreamed at regional, national and European level and ideally with the potential to be developed further either by EU funding or else through national and regional support.
The bottom-up practices should correctly address the fixed priorities set to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity, make a strong impact on education and training reforms and initiate systemic change.
Through the wide dissemination of project outcomes at transnational, national and/or regional levels, also taking national, European Industrial Ecosystems and regional smart specialisation strategies into account, Forward-Looking Projects are expected to make cathartic impact at system level to help education and training systems better meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world."

","18 January 2022
","27 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to:
Multiple levels of the computer design hierarchy, ranging from (semiconductor) technologies for low power, secure, or high-performance hardware realisations, through hardware organisations (microarchitectures), up to customised RISC-V Instruction Set Architectures. The expected results must have the potential for quick commercialisation after the end of the project, in order to demonstrate industrial relevance, feasibility and possible business models. The expected results must be aligned with demands and conform with user requirements. The IP- and functional blocks must be validated for industrial use, in order to create low-threshold access to RISC-V.
System software and support by appropriate design approaches and toolchains.
Development of industrial qualified open-source building blocks should be in line with the roadmaps developed under HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-05: Open Source Hardware for ultra-low-power, secure processors
Proposals should also lay the groundwork for future exploitation and further enhancements. If successful, those could be supported by future calls within KDT and/or other programs. Ultimately, the efforts should accelerate the developments in the field of open-source hardware and render it accessible to a wider community.
Special attention should be paid to the inclusion of industrial players and a user centric view in the consortia.
Scope:
Proposals for this call will develop RISC-V compliant IP blocks. Certain IP blocks may be proprietary solutions; however, a large share of developed building blocks provided with a permissive open-source licence is preferred. All developed blocks must come with publicly available documentation, benchmarks, verification suites, and validated reference designs (including firmware/drivers, if required).
For this call, the RISC-V architectural aspect of the proposed IP building blocks should be clearly identifiable. Furthermore, each IP block should be able to demonstrate the optimisation goals it was designed for (low power, high security, processing acceleration, etc.) in realistic application contexts and appropriate use cases.
The following is a list of building blocks of which some must be developed in the proposed project. This list is not definitive but rather an indication of the kind of blocks. A definitive list should be discussed with the consortia selected under HORIZON-CL4-2021-
DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-05. In addition, the selected building blocks must support the common European roadmap and the ecosystem for RISC-V.
Extend the RISC-V core IP towards a scalable and fit-for-purpose architecture ranging between MCU-like (lower end) and microprocessors/network processors-like (higher end).
High-speed memory interfaces for advanced DDR (at least DDR3+ SDRAM) controllers, high-speed peripheral interfaces like scalable advanced PCI (at least PCIe Gen3+) interfaces, including the required SerDes PHYs.
Support for heterogeneous many-core SoCs, specifically scalable coherent cache infrastructure, scratchpad memory infrastructure with smart DMA, and a flexible NoC to connect cores (including accelerators)/memory/IO while considering caching/coherency.
Inter-chip communication links (e.g., for interfacing with FPGAs or other ASICs) with at least 2 Gb/s per pin.
Support for extended virtualization mechanisms and hardware multitasking, in particular in the area of cache management and interrupt controllers (PLIC, CLINT);
A minimum set of test, trace and debug IPs (JTAG controllers, …).
System and SoC simulation as well as validation environments and tools to allow for very early SW migration and respective performance assessments. Accelerating the design and validation process to shorten time-to-market for new architectures and system concepts.
In addition to the RISC-V blocks listed above, the following technologies are considered as examples of useful complements to the base blocks, and are considered in scope for this call if developed in open-source form, again with documentation, verification and validation suites:
Holistic architectural approaches for HW/SW co-design of computing systems (compilers, design tools, architectural extensions or microarchitectures targeting various semiconductor technologies) under open-source licenses.
Chiplet, interposer and especially high-bandwidth, low-latency, low-energy die-to-die communication technologies.
Template PCB designs for PCIe-attached accelerators, similar to existing FPGA evaluation/prototyping boards, but allowing the easy integration of a user-provided ASIC instead of an FPGA,
Communication peripheral interfaces, specifically Ethernet (at least 1G) and USB (at least 2.0).
According to the strategy defined in the projects of HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-05 and the common European roadmap for RISC-V, proposals will also need to develop re-usable verification infrastructure that supports a repository, which includes IP blocks accompanied by test frameworks for safety/security.
A compliance standard is defined that certifies interoperability and industrial readiness of open-source hardware solutions. For the application in safety-critical environments, this compliance standard should include the requirements in accordance with relevant safety standards, e.g. ISO 26262. If other standards are relevant, they should be considered in the proposal too.
One or more demonstrators should be built in a close to industrial environment with a number of RISC-V building blocks in combination with necessary proprietary IP relevant for the application areas of interest. For instance, in the safety/security area, hardware/software co-certification for safety and security should be demonstrated.
A software development platform must be created (for compiler, linker, debugger, middleware, etc.) that proposes highly efficient code (in terms of power, speed, etc.) based on state-of-the-art programming languages.
Some of the developed building blocks could be supported by the current EUROPRACTICE- processes at 65 nm and smaller.
In terms of exploitation, the proposals must assess the sustainable provisions to support industrial use, including administrative and legal support, especially towards SMEs. The developed methods and standards should be prepared for incorporation into an organisation/setup that makes the results industrially available beyond project duration.
Of importance to this call are:
All proposals are encouraged to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with relevant actions funded nationally, under EuroHPC (including the European Processor Initiative), or any other actions on RISC-V.
All proposals are encouraged to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the projects selected under the call HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-05: Open Source Hardware for ultra-low-power, secure processors (CSA) and to support and lay the groundwork for the further development of the common European roadmap for RISC-V.
Where relevant, synergies with other European partnerships and any of the Horizon Europe Clusters are encouraged. . Proposals must describe how the consortia ensure complementarity to other funded actions.
Reminding that of general importance to the KDT calls are:
Re-use of results from previous ECSEL JU, H2020 or EUREKA-cluster projects is encouraged.
Developing synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives and/or funding programmes.
Encouraging SMEs to participate in those developments, in particular paying attention to the needs of SMEs, involve SMEs in project execution, and develop solutions that can be taken up and/or exploited by SMEs"

Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Establish a platform that nurtures the growth of a design ecosystem in Europe. The platform should support and stimulate design reuse, enable the exploitation of advanced technologies in different application domains, and provide a breeding ground for deep-tech startups;
Ease of the access to training, customer support, IP, and leading-edge design tools.
Support efficient fabrication (multi-project wafers (MPW) and small volume) of ASICs, photonics, MEMS, sensors, etc. and their integration at system level.
Support technology offerings of research centres with lower TRL to be promoted over the platform
Proposal for long-term operation of the platform to support Universities and European research centres
Scope:
Semiconductors are at the centre of strong geostrategic interests, and at the core of the global technological race. A priority for Europe is to strengthen its design capacity and to lower the barriers to get access to advanced semiconductor technologies. Amongst others, this requires the nurturing and supply of people with the right digital skills, and the provision of routes to prototype and commercialisation. Not only large enterprises, but also startups and academic institutions play a key role and are crucial in the European semiconductor value chain.
Proposals need to lower the entry-barrier for academia, research institutes and very importantly for startups, and SMEs by offering affordable access to a portfolio of industrial-grade design tools, IP blocks, including open-source ones (e.g. RISC-V based), and prototyping technologies. Services offered must include initial advice, training, support, reduced entry costs, prototyping and a clear route to chip manufacture and product supply. Proposals must include a KPI on start-ups and SMEs that use the services provided by the platform."

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes in relation to acceleration services in support of the institutional transformation of higher education institutions (HEI):
A methodology towards acceleration services that can help HEI or alliances/networks of HEIs in pursuing institutional transformations, including a monitoring mechanism to assess quality of the delivered services.
A coaching service with best practice examples and guidance for individual HEIs as well as networks of HEIs, aligned with the common transformation agenda, facilitating access to finance from various sources.
Tested acceleration services with user groups (HEI umbrella organisations, individual HEIs, or networks of HEIs, including partners from surrounding ecosystems), supporting HEI or networks of HEIs in developing a strategy to pursue institutional transformations in the field of R&I.
An investment strategy mechanism, implemented with the user group, facilitating access to funding from national, regional, or EU resources to deliver on the Higher Education Transformation Agenda.
Progress of the user groups of the acceleration services regarding the implementation of the chosen areas of the transformation agenda, measured through a monitoring mechanism.
Policy feedback to the European Commission and Member States on the acceleration services, and widespread dissemination of the pilot results to other target groups
Scope:
The overall aim of the Higher Education Institutions acceleration services is to help institutions to successfully implement a strategy and roadmap for transformation, by creating a shared knowledge base, coaching service and virtual meeting place for them to connect with peers and other ecosystem actors, as well as with investors and public funders. The acceleration services should consist of (i) a coaching and support mechanism for HEIs to pursue institutional transformation in various areas, (ii) a methodology for an investment strategy to facilitate access of higher education institutions and surrounding ecosystem to support to deliver on the chosen transformations, (iii) a monitoring mechanism to assess progress in the transformation efforts. Projects should address all three aspects and test them with user groups.
HEIs, including universities, are crucial drivers of knowledge ecosystems, and increasingly also of innovation ecosystems. The new ERA is expected to strengthen the R&I dimension of HEIs through a comprehensive institutional Higher Education Transformation Agenda in synergy with the European Education Area, reinforcing their role as drivers of change, fostering their recovery, enabling shared objectives between the EU and Member States’ initiatives to support higher education institutions in their efforts to transform on their education, research, innovation and service to society missions. To deliver on the transformation agenda for HEIs a large-scale concerted action in support of the institutional transformation efforts of HEIs will be required, including a standard methodology to develop roadmaps of EU, national and regional actions and investment measures for institutions or alliances.
Projects should build on the results of previous analyses that set out a framework for empowering HEIs across Europe in their research and innovation mission, facilitating ongoing transformation processes based on universities’ needs (“Towards a 2030 Vision on the Future of Universities in the field of research and innovation in Europe”, October 2020[1]), and the analyses performed under the previous Work Programme (in particular the study “Knowledge ecosystems in the new ERA: a comprehensive analysis of the state of play, the design of monitoring mechanisms, and creation of a toolbox of support measures”, 2021).The projects should link and build on the results of the initiative of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) on Innovation Capacity Building for Higher Education launched in 2021 that has the objective to unlock the full innovation potential of higher education institutions (HEIs).
The Higher Education Transformation Agenda developed under the previous Work Programme is expected to include the most important priorities and challenges for HEIs regarding institutional transformations towards the future, including (trans)national cooperation with other HEIs, and the growing importance of engagement with a broad range of sectors and societal actors inherent to the multiple dimensions of HEI (education, research, innovation, service to society). Acceleration services should address all possible R&I areas of the Higher Education Transformation Agenda such as: (a) empower HEIs towards developing shared R&I strategies that deliver on Europe’s challenges with critical mass; (b) facilitate the sharing of capacity, infrastructure and resources through collaborative settings, such as the European Universities initiative; (c) improve the attractiveness of researchers’ careers, including through reform of the career assessment and incentives regimes; (d) facilitate co-operation with surrounding R&I ecosystem actors; (e) support the transition to knowledge- and digitally-driven HEIs that mainstream Open Science practices and include research and innovation outputs in teaching; (f) engage citizens in solving societal challenges; (g) support institutional change through inclusive gender equality plans.
Projects are expected to a methodology how to deploy such acceleration services including (i) access to coaches, mentors, expertise and training from academia or outside academia, with different profiles that match with the areas from the transformation agenda, which the project puts at the disposal of individual HEIs or networks of universities in need of institutional transformation in the field of R&I; these experts, coaches, mentors, etc should provide support for (ii) strategy development, (iii) roadmap development, and (iv) mapping of required support resources, as well as provide (v) detailed advice on access to funding from EU, national, and regional sources to allow the HEIs to deliver on the transformations; this should in particular include support and access to financial instruments for excellent research and innovation capacity, and support for disruptive innovation from academic sector, incl. spin-offs from universities and public research organisations, and cooperation agreements between academic and business sector. This should lead to a standard methodology to develop specific investment agendas for individual institutions or networks of HEI that consists of different funding and financial instrument branches, aligned with the priorities and areas of the common transformation agenda, and realising concerted support to the institutional transformation efforts universities want to engage in.
The acceleration services should be piloted together with large user groups (either individual HEI, networks or alliances of universities and surrounding ecosystem actors, or umbrella organisations of HEI), and progress of the users in the implementation of the chosen areas of the transformation agenda should be measured. Actions should therefore include an evaluation mechanism that enables to assess the strategies from individual HEIs or alliances of universities, pursuing institutional transformation towards universities of the future, for instance under supervision of an ‘acceleration board’ of independent experts. The evaluation mechanism should also monitor progress of the HEIs in the implementation of the chosen areas from the transformation agenda.
Projects should disseminate widely the methodology and the results of the pilot with user groups, as well as provide policy recommendations to the Commission and Member States on the acceleration services, in view of future targeted and synergetic actions in support of Higher Education sector.
The duration of the action should not exceed 5 years.

Projects are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
sound science cases for new research infrastructures, including expected scientific breakthrough, gap analysis and feasibility/design studies to support planning and decision making at the national level (e.g. funding bodies, governments) and at European level (e.g. ESFRI);
a better alignment of the development of the research infrastructure landscape with the advancement of excellent science and frontier research;
new services and access opportunities available to the research community, allowing to better tackle scientific and societal challenges.
Scope:
This topic aims at supporting the development of new concepts for the next generation of research infrastructures of European interest[1], single/multi sited, distributed or virtual, that none or few countries might individually be able to afford. All fields of research can be considered.
Major upgrades of existing infrastructures may also be considered if the end result is significantly transformative and equivalent to a new infrastructure concept.
Proposals for RI concept development will tackle all key questions concerning the technical and conceptual feasibility of new or upgraded fully fledged user facilities.
In this respect, proposals should address all following aspects:
demonstrate relevance in relation to ERA, including to the existing landscape, and the advancement with respect to the state-of-art of the new infrastructure;
highlight the research challenges the new research infrastructures will make possible to address, including at global level;
indicate the gaps in the research infrastructure landscape the new infrastructure will cover and the synergies with existing infrastructures at European and global level, including those co-financed from other EU instruments (e.g.: Cohesion policy);
indicate, when relevant, the potential impact of the new research infrastructure at regional level.
Proposals should also provide evidence that the project will effectively:
identify technologies and develop research infrastructure architecture (e.g. single site or distributed, …);
identify scientific user communities (and their related needs) that will benefit from access to RI services, including scientific data and instrumentation, and develop the planning of research services to users;
identify governance options and strategic approaches for institutional/stakeholders’ commitment and engagement;
develop initial financial plans for the RI construction (or major upgrades) and operation as well as preliminary ideas for long-term sustainability, including synergies with other funds and programmes (e.g.: ERDF);
develop plans for an efficient data curation and preservation and for the provision of access to data collected or produced by the future infrastructure, in line with the FAIR principles.
Proposals considering just a new component of a research infrastructure are not in scope of this topic.
When relevant, environmental (including climate-related) impacts as well as the optimisation of resource and energy use should be integrated in the concept development of new research infrastructures. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
enable a rewards and recognition system based on a new generation of (qualitative or quantitative) metrics and indicators[1], leading to a culture and system change that increases the quality and impact, the creativity and the transparency of and trust in science;
establish a system of qualitative information based on community-led curation and annotations of research outcomes that feeds into a revamped rewards and recognition system;
contribute to the Horizon Europe EOSC Partnership.
Scope:
A coherent corpus of reports and recommendations[2]shows a broad consensus among researchers and policy makers that changes in the evaluation of research and researchers’ performance are necessary in order to incentivise higher quality research, collaboration and open science practices.
This topic supports the development of EOSC-federated services and tools that allow the gathering and monitoring of information and data on the use and uptake of research outputs and of open science practices across borders and disciplines. Such tools and services are essential to collect the information to be used for next generation metrics[3], together with qualitative indicators, in an assessment system that valorises open science.
Services and tools should collect data on the different usages of research outputs such as data sets, models, software, etc., on the usage of EOSC services, research infrastructures, data platforms, etc., and on open science practices such as those identified in the context of the Open Science Policy Platform registry of pilots and implementations of responsible metrics[4] and the RDA Interest Group on Open Science Graphs for FAIR Data[5].
Proposals should also aim to promote the adoption of community-led curation and annotation systems to foster qualitative aspects of a new generation research assessment system. Related services should be developed, considering for example FAIRness evaluation and the use of machine learning algorithms and AI, to provide qualitative information that will enrich the meta-information of all research outputs.
The tools and services may support research-performing and/or research-funding organisations in measuring the usage, relevance, quality and impact of research outputs, research infrastructures and open science practices, thereby providing the necessary data and information for next-generation metrics and indicators for the implementation of a new research assessment system.
In developing the services and the tools, it is important to integrate a level of flexibility that allows research-performing and research-funding organisations to set their own recruitment and evaluation policies, respecting also the differences among scientific disciplines, taking into account the specificities of the different career stages and allowing for diversity in practices.
Proposals should take into account existing services, tools and infrastructures in order not to duplicate efforts, e.g. on data collection, on discipline based metadata schemas, on AAI and on Persistent Identifiers developed by projects resulting from the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-03.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC.

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Improve the understanding of the current landscape of scientific book and monograph publishing in different fields of science in which it plays an important role, and in particular the bottlenecks in strategies and policies for their open access.
Support aligned funder and institutional policies for open access monographs and books within the open science culture in the European Research Area and facilitate their coordination.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Address and increase equity, diversity and inclusivity in open science practices[1] inside the European Research Area.
Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and to set it as a modus operandi of modern science.
Scope:
Monographs, books and other types of long-text formats are very important outputs in some disciplines, such as in the Social Sciences and the Humanities. Whilst many disciplines rely nearly exclusively on the production of articles, professional advancement requirements, as well as the nature of the research and the writing process in some disciplines, result in the unwavering significance of long-text formats and monographs, both in the digital and in the print formats.
Open access for monographs and other long-text formats has been a slow process in multiple aspects. This is likely because of the higher costs and business models of book publishing, as well as a hesitancy on the side of researcher to trust important parts of their work in terms of volume to the new open access publishing environment. Additionally, funder policies and strategies focus a lot less on monographs than on journal articles, and they are often recommendations and not requirements.
This action aims to support the development of aligned institutional and funder policies and strategies regarding open access to books and monographs in Europe. In this context, the action should support: 1. activities that foster greater understanding of bottlenecks in the development of policies and strategies for open access to books and monographs by institutions and funders; 2. the coordination of policies amongst funders and research institutions, and the sharing of good practices in policies and strategies for open access to books and monographs; 3. actionable and evidence-based recommendations and resources for comprehensive institutional and funder policies for open access to books and monographs. The action may also envisage international cooperation with entities outside the EU Member States and associated countries.
The action should be no longer than 24 months.
[1]Open science practices may include: providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software, models, algorithms, and workflows); early and open sharing of research (for example through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, crowd-sourcing of solutions to a specific problem); participation in open peer-review; measures to ensure reproducibility of results; and involving citizens, civil society and end-users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and content, including citizen science."

","19 January 2022
","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Trust in science is key for an inclusive, open and democratic society.[1] To sustain that trust, it is pivotal all research is conducted in line with the highest standards on research ethics and integrity. Research misconduct, in any stage of the research process, can undermine public trust in research and may amount to severe socio-economic consequences.
Several factors may lead researchers to breach research ethics and integrity standards and engage in questionable research practices. While some of these factors are systemic and institutional, individual factors may contribute to researchers’ behaviour within the institutional environments in which they operate. While researchers mostly act with integrity , they sometimes (and often unintentionally) end up engaging in questionable practices that could lead to transgressions, engulfing research teams, departments, institutions and on rare occasions, even national research systems. In order to develop a comprehensive preventive policy and support research organizations and research funders to uphold the highest standards of research ethics and integrity, there is a need to explore in depth the behavioural and organizational factors that may facilitate researchers engaging in questionable practices and misconduct and develop methodologies to address those factors.
This action aims to improve the understanding of researchers’ behaviours and incorporate this knowledge in measures aiming at enhancing promotion of ethics and integrity principles through shared responsibility (individual and institutional), improved education and training processes and qualified mentoring and support. Guaranteeing a generalised and consistently high level of research ethics and integrity, could drastically improve the relevance, robustness, accessibility and dissemination of research results and enhance societal trust in the scientific process.
Scope:
In order to elucidate behavioural factors that may lead researchers to breach standards of research ethics and integrity, this action should perform a literature review, map the existing knowledge on behavioural ethics and moral psychology and identify research outcomes and research needs.
Based on the results of the literature review the action should develop a casuistry-based methodology to address research misconduct. This methodology should also take into account personal and institutional responsibilities for the promotion of research integrity and relevant research and efforts on the rehabilitation and reintegration of researchers. Particular attention should be paid to issues related to the mental health and wellbeing of researchers, especially for those employed in uncertain work conditions (short-term contracts, early career researchers, students, etc.), including with respect to bullying and sexual harassment as well as other forms of gender-based violence.
Based on the results of the literature review, the action should conduct a public consultation process with all involved stakeholders and ensuring adequate representation of young students and early career researchers. The literature review and the consultation process should also incorporate real life experiences from researchers, members of ethics and misconduct committees, Integrity and Ethics officers (and the local and national level).Participation of the private sector is strongly encouraged, especially as behavioural studies on ethical conduct in industry have been widely published and discussed.
Publicly available results from relevant EU funded research projects[2] (e.g. SOP4RI, Integrity, PRO-Ethics, TRUST, PRO-RES, Path2Integirty) should be taken into account. Structured cooperation with the e-platform Embassy of Good Science[3] and the European Network ENRIO, is necessary.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly advised, in particular with countries which have concluded an international agreement on science and technology with the European Union. Participants from countries, which are not eligible for funding according to the General Annexes, may take part in the project as associated partners.
The action should develop:
An identification of current needs in improving institutional research culture, taking into account the potential unequal impacts on people of different genders;
Specific course material to enhance and supplement current efforts on research ethics and integrity that stem from (but not limited to) EU-funded projects (see https://www.embassy.science/);
Guidelines to facilitate adoption of the gained knowledge in host institutions - as a supplement to existing Standard Operating procedures (see SOP4RI, https://www.sops4ri.eu/). These guidelines should also cover responsible mentoring, supervision and role modelling;
Methodologies for measuring the short-, medium- and long-term impact of ethics and integrity trainings in the attitudes and behaviours of students and researchers and their ethical conduct in research and innovation; and
A best practice manual, based on case studies of implemented measures that analyse what works and what does not work in various contexts, to enable practice-oriented learning.
All outputs of the action must be available on the e-platform Embassy of Good Science web site (https://www.embassy.science/)

Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
strengthened collaboration between research infrastructures and technology infrastructures, leading to better identification and integration of services available to industrial users;
enhanced visibility and accessibility of research infrastructures and technology infrastructures for industry and SMEs;
better structured and strengthened European technology infrastructure landscape and its governance;
alignment and connection of research and technology infrastructure actions with other relevant actions in the European Research Area, in industrial policies, and other policies;
stronger synergies between public and private investment plans for technology infrastructures and for research infrastructures;
reinforced global competitiveness of the European Research Area.
Scope:
Research infrastructures and technology infrastructures are among the key elements in the successful establishment of innovation ecosystems. Ranging from exploratory research facilities to testing, validation, and upscaling platforms, they enable technology development and innovation, providing SMEs and industry with the essential services that are needed to accelerate the entry into the market of innovative solutions supporting the twin green and digital transition and other socio-economic challenges. Research infrastructures and technology infrastructures provide important complementary activities in this respect. However, they are often developing services in isolation from each other, not fully taking into account the needs of industrial users along the entire innovation cycle.
Prior to the formulation of a specific European Research Area action[1] and the Council conclusion[2] mentioning the development of a European strategy on technology infrastructures, a Commission staff working document[3] took stock of existing, though un-coordinated, initiatives at regional, national and European level and identified key challenges that need to be addressed to create a well functioning technology infrastructures landscape.
The development of the research infrastructure landscape as well as access to research infrastructure services is significantly more advanced due to both the strategic priority setting process, through the Roadmap of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, and the significant effort at the EU level to open up national facilities and laboratories to international users. It is important to draw relevant lessons from these processes in order to further develop and implement the governance of technology infrastructures at European level.
In this respect, activities proposed should support policy development in the following main areas:
Mapping and prioritisation
Consolidation and integration of existing technology infrastructure mappings to increase visibility of technology infrastructures and facilitate gap analyses.
Gap analysis and prioritisation at EU and Member States' level towards high priority areas in synergy with the common industrial technology roadmaps, industrial alliances, partnerships, and industrial ecosystems under the EU industrial strategy.
Identification of good practices (with focus on services) to improve linkages and complementarity between research infrastructures and technology infrastructures in specific priority areas and ecosystems.
Operations and guidelines
Preparation of pilot strategic action plans for technology infrastructures in selected priority areas, for instance linked with the green and digital transition, in partnership with relevant actors and including options for their long-term sustainability, taking into account private and public investments and networking with relevant pan-European research infrastructures.
Development of an investment agenda for technology infrastructures taking into account private and public investments, as well as investments in relevant research infrastructures.
Development of guidelines and recommendations to help networks of technology infrastructures connecting with other existing research infrastructures and technology infrastructures to facilitate access and to integrate services for specific technology areas or industrial ecosystems.
Governance
Identification of best practices of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures, in order to further develop and implement the governance of technology infrastructures at European level, adapted to their specificities (i.e. ecosystem and value chain approach, different stakeholders involved including industry, SMEs and research performing organisations).
Networking of relevant actors and infrastructures including for the identified priority areas.
Analysis of how technology infrastructures and research infrastructures could be better integrated in relevant existing frameworks and instruments, such as industrial technology roadmaps, Partnerships, Industrial Alliances, or IPCEIs.
Outreach and communication
Identification and liaising with relevant stakeholders related to research infrastructures and technology infrastructures in general, as well as to specific priority areas, and collecting stakeholder input through targeted surveys and workshops.
Development and execution of communication and outreach activities, including organisation of workshops and outreach events.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
A methodology and toolbox to design and implement testing of policy relevant findings stemming from European R&I that can contribute to EU resilience and future preparedness.
A knowledge base of EU research findings, with high capacity to inform policy and engage citizens and research communities, that are tested, including the methodologies for testing (small scale experiments, randomised control trials etc).
Lessons learnt to enhance the use of R&I results to enable fast response in the face of future crises and strengthen economic and social resilience, for example through supporting policy reforms, new regulation, social innovation, behavioural change, new technology adoption and the integration of the gender dimension.
Scope:
R&I results and new scientific knowledge can inform policy making and help address societal challenges through new technological and societal solutions, as well as through providing policy recommendations and policy options with a proper (scientific) understanding of the underlying conditions. Testing policy recommendations and findings of scientific research through experiments and novel methodologies increases understanding of the implications, risks and opportunities of possible new solutions, enabling societies to respond faster and more effectively to crises and built resilience and social cohesion.
This action aims at increasing the visibility and fostering the use of R&I results with high policy relevance to contribute to the recovery and resilience of Europe, while engaging research communities and citizens in an “experimentation space” for new, science based, socially inclusive and gender responsive policy initiatives and solutions.
The action will match policy relevant findings for EU resilience stemming from research (such as from EU H2020, HE and previous programmes as well as other EU programmes, and national level publicly funded research) with national, regional and local needs, and carry out the experimentation phase in co-creation with the research communities and citizens. At the core of the action is the design of appropriate trial mechanisms that will test research findings which can be translated to policy and new societal solutions, and thereby provide policy makers and citizens with a high degree of confidence and trust in responding to new challenges.
The project consortium may consider links with related knowledge management activities by the European Commission, including the European Commission’s Knowledge Centres and the Knowledge for Policy Platform hosted by the Joint Research Centre.

","HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions
","19 January 2022
","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Structured understanding of the underlying drivers, of concrete and effective interventions - funding, community-based, technical and policy - to increase reproducibility of the results of R&I; and of their benefits;
Effective solutions, policy-, technical- and practice-based, to increase the reproducibility of R&I results in funding programmes, in communities and in the dissemination of scientific results;
Greater collaboration, alignment of practices and joint action by stakeholders to increase reproducibility, including but not limited to training, specialised careers and guidelines for best practice.
These outcomes should contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Increased proportion of reproducible results from publicly funded R&I;
Increased re-use of scientific results by research and innovation;
Greater quality of the scientific production.
Scope:
Reproducibility refers to the possibility for the scientific community to obtain the same results as the originators of a specific finding. As such, reproducibility is core to scientific progress, and there is debate on whether there is a ‘crisis of reproducibility’ in contemporary science. At a time when funding levels for R&I are under scrutiny globally, and societal trust in the outcomes of research and innovation become increasingly essential, there is a need to address inefficiencies in the research process, to avoid useless and costly repetition, to maximise return on investment in R&D&I, to prevent the propagation of mistakes, and to facilitate the translation of results into innovations.
Therefore, this topic aims to fund activities to
a) determine how increased reproducibility generates gains and savings in the R&I process and improve overall performance - alongside the demonstrated positive effects on their quality, integrity and trust-worthiness, and
b) find, experiment and mainstream concrete solutions and best-practices to increase the reproducibility of research funded with European taxpayers’ money, including through the more systematic integration of sex and gender as variables whenever relevant.
Consequently, actions should help understand and promote reproducibility by:
1) creating an open knowledge base of results, methodologies and interventions on the drivers and consequences of reproducibility for the R&I system; and to fill the main gaps in such knowledge;
2) develop, validate, pilot and deploy practices and practical tools for funders, publishers and scientists;
3) promote uptake, greater collaboration, and increased alignment of the activities of stakeholders - scientific and technical communities, publishers and funders among others - to increase reproducibility.
Finally, projects should assist further policy development on reproducibility, based on scoping work by the Commission[1]. While solutions should be applicable to Europe, attention should be paid to reproducibility in global science.
It is expected that the funded action(s) will adhere to best practices in open science and reproducibility (e.g. re-use existing results, fully document the research process), and provide a final reflection based on their own experience at the forefront of reproducibility.

","19 January 2022
","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Consolidated evidence base on open and responsible research and innovation[1] training for researchers at all stages of their careers across the European Research Area.
Development and piloting of high-quality training to a significant number of researchers on diverse aspects of open and responsible research and innovation.
Establishment of a platform for further development of training, mutual learning, and dissemination of recommendations to authorities and institutions responsible for researcher training.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Improved skills leading to greater employability and career prospects for researchers.
Improvements in the excellence of the science conducted, improved capacity within the European Research Area to tackle societal challenges, greater interaction between science and society, improved overall effectiveness of EU research and innovation funding.
Improved engagement and cooperation of researchers, with communicators, journalists, industry, policy maker and civil society.
Scope:
In order to ensure the excellence of EU research and innovation, the research workforce needs to strengthen skills related to integrity, avoidance of various forms of bias, including gender bias, non-discrimination and inclusion, FAIR data management, data robustness and reproducibility, dissemination and exploitation of results, and interdisciplinary research. It requires skills to communicate science and research results, in the media (including social media) and to policy makers, and skills to participate in public debates. It also requires skills to engage the public to develop research and innovation agenda, the ability to work in multi-actor collaborations covering all parts of the quadruple helix[2] where interests and motivation for engaging in research may be diverse, and actively involve citizens in research activities such as citizen science to expand the scope and the potentials of science itself. These skills are needed at all stages of researchers’ careers, from undergraduate onwards (including as part of doctoral training).
This action consists of three parts, all of which must be addressed:
The first part consists of consolidating existing evidence[3] on researcher training on open and responsible research and innovation, at all stages of their careers, from undergraduate onwards (including as part of doctoral training), and identifying gaps in existing practices in the European Research Area. This will include mutual learning activities within and outside the European Research Area to ensure established and emergent good practices are considered. Existing initiatives, such as the European Charter and Code[4] and the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training[5], should be taken into account.
The second part consists of developing training modules, courses or other kinds of interventions on open and responsible research and innovation that will be piloted to a significant number of students and researchers in different kinds of research organisations and higher education organisations across Europe, and at all stages of their studies and careers. The learning outcomes will be evaluated, with a view to refining the training ready for more widespread deployment (e.g. at national, institutional levels, or in MSCA actions). Attention should be paid to the gender dimension of the training/learning outcomes, and to ensure that the training is adapted and piloted to researchers of all backgrounds (age, ethnicity, geography, gender, etc.).
The third part consists of establishing a platform, sustainable beyond the lifetime of project funding, to continue knowledge exchange, develop guidance, and further develop training on open and responsible research and innovation. Part of the work must include the wide dissemination of policy recommendations aimed at relevant research institutions and levels of governance.
Working closely with relevant on-going actions, quadruple helix stakeholders, and science outreach stakeholders, is advised. The action is also expected to build on and valorise results from projects already funded under the “Science with and for Society” part of Horizon 2020.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Societal Engagement
[1]Responsible research and innovation involves multi-actor and public engagement in research and innovation, easier access to scientific results, the take up of gender and ethics in the research and innovation content and process, and formal and informal science education.
[2]A model of cooperation between industry, academia, civil society and public authorities, with a strong emphasis on citizens and their needs.
[3]In addition to relevant national-level initiatives, or even initiatives outside the EU, this includes Horizon 2020 projects supported through topics SEAC-2-2014 and topic SwafS-08-2019-2020 under Science with and for Society; the Horizon 2020 Innovative Training Networks supported through the MSCA-ITN topics as well as the COFUND projects for doctoral programmes under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, and the Erasmus+ European University Alliances and Horizon 2020 top-up pilot.

","02 March 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The European Youth Event is an event for young people and by young people. Local EYEs should follow this key principle. Therefore, organisations selected for co-financing under this call for proposals are expected to be local or youth organisations (as main applicants). Partnership with a public authority for the implementation of the event will be considered an asset, in order to ensure strong links with the local level and a solid operational capacity.
Objective:
The main objective of this call for proposals is to bring the European Parliament closer to its citizens in organising two local European Youth Events (local EYEs).
The expected results of the actions is to strengthen European citizenship among young people, make them aware about how the EU works and empower them to become active citizens. Ultimately the objective is to connect the EP to its younger citizens and make them vote in the next parliamentary elections.
The actions proposed in the call should target young people aged 16-30. Special attention should be paid to reaching out to minority communities from peripheral regions of Europe and citizens that normally don’t have so much contact with the EU and are less likely to already be involved in EU action, such as vulnerable groups as defined in the call for proposals.
Scope:
This call for proposals is one of the actions of the European Parliament to contribute to the European Year of Youth announced by the European Commission for 2022, intending notably:
to encourage all young people, especially those with fewer opportunities, or belonging to vulnerable groups[1], to become active citizens;
to draw inspiration from the actions, vision and insights of young people to further strengthen and invigorate the common EU project, building upon the Conference on the Future of Europe.
[1]Vulnerable groups include people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, rural and remote areas and people with disabilities."

Project results are expected to contribute to several of the following expected outcomes:
enhanced scientific competitiveness of European research infrastructures
foundations for the development of innovative companies;
increase of the technological level of industries through the co-development of advanced technologies for research infrastructures and creation of potential new markets;
integration of research infrastructures into local, regional and global innovation systems.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to deliver innovative scientific instrumentation, tools and methods, which advance the state-of-art of European RIs, and show transformative potential in RIs operation. The related developments, which underpin the provision of improved and advanced services, should lead research infrastructures to support new areas of research and/or a wider community of users, including industrial users.
Cutting-edge technologies will also enhance the potential of RIs to contribute addressing EU policy objectives and socio-economic challenges.
Proposals should address all following aspects:
Research and development of new scientific instrumentation, tools and methods for research infrastructures taking into due account resource efficiency (e.g. energy consumption) and environmental (including climate-related) impacts;
their technology validation and prototyping;
training of RI staff for the operation and use of these new solutions;
the innovative potential for industrial exploitation of the solutions and/or for the benefits of the society.
Consortia must be built around a leading core of at least 3 world-class research infrastructures, being ESFRI infrastructures, European Research Infrastructures Consortia (ERICs) and/or other world-class research infrastructures of European interest[1] and can include a wider set of RIs. Other technological partners, including industry and SMEs, should also be involved, thus promoting innovation and knowledge sharing through co-development of new technical solutions for research infrastructures.
Proposals may include PCP[2] subcontracting activities as described in part H of the General Annexes of the Work Programme. This option encourages the use of public procurements for the competitive development of new specific solutions, whilst opening market opportunities for industry and researchers active in Europe. By establishing the procurement process in consecutive phases, the PCP activity can support the development of competing designs, prototypes, and solution testing. This ensures that investment risks do not prevent tackling specific scientific and technological issues, and allows to approach a problem from different angles and to test different solutions.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
[1]A research infrastructure is of European interest when is able to attract users from EU or associated countries other than the country where the infrastructure is located.
[2] 'Pre-commercial procurement' is defined as procurement of R&D services involving risk-benefit sharing under market conditions and competitive development in phases. PCP focuses on the R&D phase before wide commercialisation.
'Risk-benefit sharing under market conditions' refers to the PCP approach in which procurers share with suppliers at market price the risks and the benefits related to the IPR resulting from the R&D.
'Competitive development in phases' refers to the competitive approach to buy the R&D from several competing R&D providers in parallel and to compare and identify the best value for money solutions on the market to address the PCP challenge. To reduce the investment risk for the procurer, reward the most competitive solutions and facilitate the participation of smaller innovative companies, the R&D is also split into phases (solution design, prototyping, original development and validation / testing of the first products), with the number of competing R&D providers being reduced after each phase."

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The actions funded under this topic will coordinate national and regional R&I programmes by pooling national resources and contributing to the alignment of national research and innovation policies. Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Identification of common research and innovation priorities agreed among the participating national and regional R&I programmes, taking into account international developments where relevant;
Implementation of multiannual joint calls, resulting in the funding of transnational collaborative R&I projects;
Implementation of other joint activities supporting the market, regulatory or societal uptake of results;
Contribution to participating states meeting Global Challenges, including relevant contribution to the SDGs.
Scope:
Since the introduction of the European Research Area (ERA) and starting with FP6, Programme level collaboration among Member States and their research and innovation programmes has become a cornerstone of the ERA, with annual investment from Member States of more than € 800 million per year. More than 250 networks among research funders have been created over time, serving different research needs but always coordinating public research investments across borders and allowing researchers to apply for calls for transnational research projects funded by the participating states.
The new policy approach to European Partnerships limits co-funding to Member State collaboration to Union and Horizon Europe priorities. Therefore, the ERA part of the Horizon Europe provides the possibility for Member States, Associated Countries and civil society organisations such as foundations, to maintain existing and establish new collaborations on priorities of their choice.
The successful proposal should align national and regional research funding programmes (managed by national or regional programme owners / managers) on agreed common priorities and implement joint calls for transnational R&I projects as well as other joint calls. Proposers have to demonstrate clear commitments from participating programmes to pool resources and ensure complementarity between activities and policies with those of the Framework Programme and relevant European Partnership Initiatives.
Applicants should pool the necessary resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes as well as, where appropriate, leverage resources from pertinent foundations, charities and transnational initiatives, with a view to implementing calls for proposals resulting in grants to third parties without EU co-funding in this area.
The proposal should also demonstrate potential impact at national, regional and transnational level research and innovation. The proposal should demonstrate that activities exclude overlaps with on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe.
Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding is encouraged.
The actions should envisage a duration which is appropriate to the ambition and complexity of the proposed topic.

Encourage mentoring across the different groups involved in the partnerships in order to take full advantage of science, technology, research and innovation;
Encourage industry-funded innovation to become part of lifelong learning programmes
Scope:
Science education should be an essential component of compulsory education for all students. Policies should support students, teachers, parents and the wider community to improve access to and provide everyone with the opportunities to pursue excellence in learning and learning outcomes and to ensure young people and adult learners alike are motivated to learn and to be fully equipped to engage in scientific discourse and facilitate further study in science education.
The proposed action targets the creation of new partnerships in local communities to foster improved science education for all citizens and to contribute to a learning continuum for all. It seeks to promote partnerships between for example teachers, students, scientists, researchers, innovators, professionals in enterprise and other stakeholders in science related fields to work together on real-life challenges and innovations within local communities with a view to engaging them in teaching and learning processes and to promote science education as part of local community development.
This action aims to support a range of activities based on collaboration at local level between formal, non-formal and informal science education providers, enterprises and civil society in order to integrate the concept of open schooling, including all educational levels, in science education.
The action should consider current policy initiatives. Reference and consideration should be given to previously funded projects. Applicants should develop links with Scientix[1] and consider links with other policy domains such as projects funded under SwafS-26-2020 (Innovators of the future: bridging the gender gap).
Currently, Europe faces a shortfall in science-knowledgeable people at all levels of society at a time when it needs ever more scientists and a science literate society. The coronavirus pandemic demonstrates the importance and necessity of having highly qualified scientists, researchers, innovators and medics to keep our society safe and healthy. To increase the uptake of science careers to feed the talent pipeline, and to improve science literacy in our adult population and support a learning continuum for all, a collaborative action on Open Schooling is proposed.

","19 January 2022
","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
seamless interactions between EOSC, operational dataspaces or environments (e.g. EMODnet, Copernicus Marine Service, Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS), etc.), researchers and other stakeholders contributing to restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters to store, share, access, analyse and process research data and other research digital objects from their own discipline, across research infrastructures, disciplines and national borders;
open and FAIR data is the new norm for research contributing to restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters;
EU-wide sharing of research data relevant to this area is shown to be a critical mechanism to facilitate ocean and water restoration across Member States and Associated Countries;
EOSC grows into a trusted research and innovation data space and service platform in Europe that supports the interdisciplinary research community involved in this mission area;
contribute to the Horizon Europe EOSC Partnership and other relevant partnerships related to restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters.
Scope:
Reuse of research data within and across disciplines and borders require openness, infrastructure capacity, better handling, careful management, machine actionability and seamless access to services all along the data life cycle. The Horizon Europe mission areas recognise upfront that providing access to data, knowledge and digital services through federated infrastructures is a key enabling condition for success. In addition, European Partnerships tackling complex societal challenges through multi-disciplinary approaches are facing important challenges in the European R&I systems, including poor data interoperability. In recent years, different scientific communities have started developing ‘thematic clouds’ or ‘data spaces’ within their domain of research and innovation. The EOSC provides the enabling framework to share, connect and upscale best practices and services by the communities to implement FAIR principles for (open, where possible) data sharing and management. The development of this framework is advancing rapidly as EOSC enters its second phase of implementation. Access to an initial EOSC federation of research infrastructures and their services is being consolidated and concepts such as FAIR data management and FAIR-by-design digital research outputs (data, publications, software, code, protocols, etc.) become more prominent.
The overall objective of this topic is to accelerate research and innovation under this mission area through better access, management, interoperability, reuse and citation of digital information, to be achieved by using and integrating EOSC resources ranging from EOSC federated infrastructures, services and data to guidelines, best practices, tools and metrics for the management of FAIR and open data, and to extend these resources to the relevant marine and maritime domains that are less familiar with EOSC.
This should be achieved through cross-domain, strategic use cases of direct relevance to the Digital Twin of the Ocean[1], the mission areas and the European Partnerships supporting this mission area on healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters.
The use cases should demonstrate the value of sharing FAIR and open research data, help to establish data sharing and management practices within the involved communities and across the Member States and Associated Countries, leveraging European research infrastructures and e-Infrastructures. The use cases should provide feedback to the EOSC Partnership on the desired future evolution of EOSC. Special attention shall be put on aspects of data harmonisation, data quality assurance, integration of data collection, data privacy and security, big-data analysis and machine learning methods, data and model validation, as well as on the socio-economic dimension of the use. Proposals should also foster the creation of user environments that researchers in this field can then use in order to seamlessly interact with digital information in the framework of the EOSC ecosystem.
Proposals should provide for activities to collaborate with relevant European Partnerships. Synergies with Horizon Europe Cluster 6 activities and other relevant initiatives, including actions stemming from Cohesion policy programmes, are welcome. Research and innovation should build on results of Horizon 2020 (e.g. the Blue Cloud project, the Odyssea project) and support the development of the Digital Twin of the Ocean. Proposers should consider already established ESFRI research infrastructures and efforts by relevant ESFRI cluster projects.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC. In particular, in areas such as data interoperability, metadata and vocabularies, the use of persistent identifiers or AAI, proposals should coordinate and establish a feedback mechanism with the awarded proposal/s from the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-05 in order to ensure alignment with EOSC policies and to identify common useful tools and resources as well as relevant data repositories that comply with EOSC guidelines. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Contributing to implementing the political priorities of the new European Commission, in particular in relation to the objective of ‘A stronger Europe in the world’, and in relation to the EU communication on the comprehensive Strategy with Africa, aiming to support building knowledge economies
Economic growth and job creation in the EU and in Africa, contributing to the AU Agenda 2030 and relevant EU policies, and enhancing the visibility of EU R&I at the international scene
Transfer and internationalisation of demonstrated technologies and know-how, both to and from the EU and Africa
Scope:
Competition has become global and so is innovation. To compete effectively in new and emerging markets, European and African SMEs need to develop partnerships with their strategic counterparts to generate joint business opportunities in new product-market combinations. Developing a new product-market combination with a strategic partner can be very challenging for SMEs on both continents in terms of technological & financial risks, and market barriers. Before starting, it is essential to assess first the technical feasibility as well as developing a deep understanding of the business environment, including the financial, legal, market and cultural aspects in the targeted markets. This instrument will allow European and African SMEs to develop a partnership beyond conventional market studies, sales channels and export aids. This Horizon Europe funded ‘INNOWWIDE Bridging Facility’ precisely covers these risks, by supporting innovative European and African SMEs in conducting Viability Assessment Projects (VAPs) in Europe and Africa, creating the favourable conditions needed to increase the uptake of European and African innovative solutions in each other’s markets. An SME friendly bottom-up approach applies, with no specific technical areas to be addressed.
The VAPs will be selected following a series of open calls organised by the action. The proposal for undertaking the action should define the organisational process for selecting the VAPs for which financial support will be granted, including the process of selecting, allocating and reporting on the use of independent experts and ensuring no conflicts of interest.
At least 75% of the EU funding shall be allocated to financial support for the third parties carrying out the selected VAPs.
The calls should specify that each VAP should include a wide variety of activities to explore the practical, technological and commercial viability of an innovative solution in particular in terms of how it needs to meet local conditions and demands.
Proposals must detail the different types of activities for which a third party may receive financial support such as market studies, partner search and networking, approaches for client/user involvement including societal, behavioural and cultural aspects, and other activities aimed at overcoming barriers for market introduction and uptake.
Proposals must clearly detail the criteria for awarding financial support and simple and comprehensive criteria for calculating the exact amount of such support, which may not exceed EUR 60 000 for each VAP. The award criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory.
Each VAP shall be led by an entity established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe associated country and shall involve at least one entity established in an African country.
The open calls must be published widely, and Horizon Europe standards with respect to transparency, equal treatment, no conflict of interest and respect of confidentiality must be adhered to. The results of the calls must be published without delay, including, for each VAP, a description of the project, the legal name and country of the third party, the start date and duration of the project, and the amount of the award.
Proposals should specify how they will promote the calls, how they will monitor and report on call results and how they will assess the quality of the outcomes and experiences from the VAPs, as well as how they will provide regular in-depth analyses and which indicators will be used for measuring the impacts achieved. Analyses should draw up R&I policy conclusions on questions such as which additional joint R&I activities in third countries should be supported, what framework conditions for R&I cooperation need improving, and what further R&I support services should be implemented.

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
a robust pan-European network of infrastructures, with all necessary relevant service-provision, that brings together already existing not-for-profit and no APC[1]-based (‘diamond’) open access publishing initiatives in order to become an integral part of EOSC – in particular through effective support to the FAIR principles and sharing common technical infrastructure standards;
a comprehensive toolbox to implement common standards for technical infrastructure and service provision available in open source repositories and adopted within the network and beyond;
interoperable data exchange and crosslinking among the network and with FAIR-compliant data repositories and other open access infrastructures already used by the research community in order to foster the concept of ”single-point of access to services and content”;
contribute to the Horizon Europe EOSC Partnership.
Scope:
This topic is addressed to not-for-profit institutions (such as universities, research centres, funders and other institutions supporting research and the dissemination of research outputs within national remits, e.g. national libraries) that run open access publishing initiatives for the public interest (non-commercial), in particular, publishing activities of journals and/or publishing platforms, and which do not levy article processing charges (APCs). Recent years have witnessed a sharp increase in open access publishing activities. Alongside commercial publishers who are in the business for publishing for profit, technology advances have enabled research-performing and other related organisations working for research to develop scholarly publishing infrastructures and services in the new digital environment, either continuing existing activities in print or in an entirely digitally-born environment. Such open access services operate in most European countries, in some cases with a national remit.
This topic aims to improve efficiency, coordination and technological alignment among the network of institutional open access publishing infrastructures and to develop and provide the technical specifications to ensure interoperability, interconnection and improved quality of services to researchers. Proposals shall build on already existing and operational publishing services across Europe and embed the open access publishing network into the EOSC ecosystem.
Proposals should cover each of the following activities:
improve the understanding of technologies and services in such institutional not-for profit services across Europe and provide recommendations for further alignment and interoperability;
coordinate the development and adoption of common technical solutions for interoperability, cross-referencing, cross-linking, and sharing metadata across the European Research Area and beyond;
support the implementation of technical specifications required to provide services through the EOSC, and the adoption of the essential solutions and standards (e.g. APIs, PIDs, metadata frameworks, ontologies, AAI etc.) to improve findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-usability of digital objects within the network of publishing infrastructures and in the EOSC federation.
Projects under this topic should liaise with Horizon Europe funded initiatives in the Work Programme Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area which address the non-technological aspects of institutional publishing under topics HORIZON-WIDERA-2021-ERA-01-43: Capacity-building for institutional open access publishing across Europe and HORIZON-WIDERA-2022-ERA-01-42: Supporting the development of aligned policies for open access books and monographs.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC.

","19 January 2022
","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Test the new ERA Hubs[1] concept across different geographies and structures in Europe, based on common compliance criteria; the process should act as an incentive for advanced ecosystems to seek recognition, and for less advanced ecosystems to reach the criteria facilitating support from European, national and regional level.
Better coordinate relationships between the European Research Area and relevant national or regional stakeholders in order to ensure the smart directionality introduced in the new ERA.
Develop a common platform for collaboration and best practice sharing across borders, sectors and disciplines on knowledge production, circulation and use, and facilitate cross-fertilisation and smart directionality among ecosystem actors to achieve transformative changes and advance Europe together.
Increase both the interoperability of the European ecosystems and the intra-operability within each territorial ecosystem, aiming to improve coordination, and foster excellence.
Facilitate a better circulation and absorption of talents in countries/regions, as well as improve knowledge circulation and uptake of research results;
Provide a toolbox of best practices for researchers, innovators, industry and institutions across Europe to cooperate.
Scope:
A vibrant ecosystem is an essential condition for growth. In order to take full advantage of possible synergies and complementarities between the EU and national and regional ecosystems for knowledge production, circulation and use, there is a need to make compatible and interoperable the policy frameworks that govern existing structures for knowledge transfer and sharing, and address common criteria for assessing work, processes and outputs. Reinforcing the networking interconnecting geographically or thematically, the ecosystem actors on the basis of smart specialisation and other strategic considerations, such as value chains, will consequently stimulate excellence and complete the coverage across Europe.
This action should build on the preparatory work of the previous Work Programme on Knowledge Ecosystems, which provides among others a mapping of existing ecosystem actors engaged in knowledge production, circulation and use across Europe, as well as designing the ERA Hubs concept as a toolbox of pre-defined common standards of work, processes and outputs, and key performance indicators on operational, programme and strategic impacts. The concept should be tested on collaborations, platforms, or other structures bringing together ecosystem actors, and increase networking between those structures in a coordinated approach, around a common agenda and compliance criteria. The rollout of the concept across Europe is expected to support and coordinate the efforts at local and regional level for the implementation of a pan-European ERA Hubs initiative.
The scope of this action is to pilot the ERA Hub concept with a limited number of ecosystems through implementation in countries and regions where knowledge ecosystem structures aligned to the ERA Hubs concept already exist, combined with countries or regions where an integrated place-based approach is missing. The main goal of the action is to fine-tune through experimentation the designed concept of ERA Hubs and its technical specifications and compliance criteria, share practices, as well as provide a toolkit of best practices and activities that ensure a strong basis for a potential scale-up in different geographies across the EU territory in the next phase.
Projects will be assigned to entities or networks of structures involved in knowledge production, circulation and use activities at European, national, regional or city level, which should take the coordination role in orchestrating the actors of an ecosystem working together to implement the ERA Hubs concept, in pursuit of intra-operability with the territorial ecosystem and a common agenda supporting the economic transitions and smart specialisation strategies, as well as job creation and skills development to better absorb talent in a country or region. These structures could be entities that have the competences and/or the willingness to become pioneers, benchmarks and ambassadors of the new concept and should include higher education institutions or their tech transfer offices, research institutes, business schools, private companies, not for profit organisations, or entities already part of pan-European networks or coming from different funding communities, in order to better connect those communities.
Support from institutional, regional, or national sources is highly encouraged (proven through e.g. letters of commitment), in order to make considerable progress in the deployment of the ERA Hubs initiative in the respective country or region.
The action should include the development of an independent monitoring mechanism to assess the progress of the ecosystem actors engaged in a common agenda and implementation of the ERA Hubs concept in a dedicated country or region. On the basis of the assessment, projects should also provide recommendations on how to deploy the ERA Hubs in different geographies and regions.

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Consolidated evidence base on sustainable institutional and territorial changes towards open and responsible research and innovation;
A central point of expertise providing services and support for research and innovation institutions, and territories, to open up to society;
A significant number of institutions and territories in the European Research Area (ERA) become more porous to society, align with the needs, values and expectations of society, improve the excellence of their research and innovation, promote gender equality, and reduce instances of ethical misconduct;
Reduction in disparities between institutions and territories in terms of their attention to open and responsible research and innovation.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Open and responsible research and innovation practices mainstreamed throughout territorial and institutional settings;
Increased impact of EU R&I outputs and the conversion of knowledge and ideas into products and services.
Scope:
Research and innovation institutions play a key role in creating an enabling environment for opening research and innovation towards society, sharing research outputs, improving research integrity and gender equality, and promoting science education, societal engagement (such as citizen science and other forms of co-design and co-creation) and two-way science communication. At territorial level, interactions between different institutions from across the quadruple helix[1], and including societal actors such as civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations, are essential to ensuring that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation are aligned with the needs, values and expectations of society.
However, European research and innovation actors lack a consolidated evidence base and guidance based on EU investments in this area to date to support them, there are significant differences in attention to different aspects of responsibility and openness between institutions and territories, rewards and incentives at the workforce and institutional level are often misaligned or even disfavour openness to society, and there is no central point of reference or provider of services and expertise to turn to.
This action consists of three parts, all of which must be addressed:
The first involves consolidating the evidence base and develop innovative guidance and other materials, which can support institutions and territories to implement sustainable institutional changes and open up to society[2]. It should take into account and build on the learning and knowledge developed by Horizon 2020’s Science with and for Society programme[3] and potentially other sources of knowledge.
The second part involves financial support to third parties, by launching ‘cascading grant’ call(s) to support institutions and territories from across the ERA to implement sustainable institutional changes towards open and responsible research and innovation. This may require consultancy or other kinds of support services to be developed and rolled out to successful institutions. A significant number of institutional changes (e.g. 70-100 individual institutional changes) should be expected in beneficiary organisations and territories. As such, a significant proportion of the funding should be allocated to the ‘cascading grant’ mechanism. One or more call(s) for proposals should be launched, which could focus on specific disciplines, MoRRI country clusters[4], or other pertinent criteria, but with the underlying goal of reducing disparities between institutions and territories in terms of their attention to different dimensions of openness and responsibility.
The third part involves acting as a central point of expertise and support services on open and responsible research and innovation for institutions and projects under Horizon Europe and within the European Research Area. This point of expertise should have appropriate high-level visibility, and the ability to interact and support all parts of the research and innovation system (all parts of quadruple helix, disciplines, sectors). In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international networking is advised to support co-operation on the issue at global level and provide expertise in support of institutions and projects.
The action should evaluate its impacts and develop recommendations useful to policy makers and those responsible for the governance of research and innovation institutions. The action should raise awareness of the benefits of open and responsible research and innovation to organisations across the ERA. It should develop close co-operation with other relevant projects, with a view to fostering collaboration and the early sharing of knowledge and evidence.

Several projects may work in parallel and contribute to several of the following expected outcomes:
Creation of a common academic researchers’ career structure, taking into account new developments and diversification of careers in academia, based on practices in Member States, linking it to the updated European Skills Competences and Occupations (ESCO) framework[1]
Enabling widespread recognition of the ESCO qualifications profile, more precisely the competences that PhD trainees and postdocs in various stages of their careers have obtained, both within and outside academia regardless of sector, discipline or location
Mainstreaming of tenure track like systems, as an attempt to improve career development and solve part of the precarity of research careers in academia
Mainstreaming practices for higher education institutions to involve non-academic sector from the onset in training & career development of PhD students
Mainstreaming value creation and intersectoral mobility schemes within higher education institutions to promote jobs and growth.
Scope:
The European Research and Innovation system needs to optimise its support for the constant flow-through of highly skilled talents to match the demand of society and the economy. Establishing an enhanced framework for researchers' careers within the EU towards a pipeline of highly skilled, creative, and resilient talents will accelerate the achievement of a knowledge-based society and economy.
The talent pipeline’s main initiator remains the curiosity-driven approach to science, delivering creative and resilient individuals that can cope with change, for the benefit of society as a whole. The autonomy of organisations that are at the basis of the talent pipeline is an additional essential success factor for the ERA to provide visible value through excellence in research and innovation.
The framework aims at addressing: (i) the recognition of the research profession and PhD qualifications within and outside academia, the structuring of the researcher scientific career (i.e. to improve interoperability between academia and other employers), (ii) the diversification of the careers of talents trained as researcher, (iii) solutions to the precariousness of researchers’ careers in academia including a model tenure-track system accompanied by possible standard principles, and (iv) strengthened interaction with business to facilitate access to the labour market.
The common framework for research careers is expected to be based on dynamic competence profiles of researchers in various stages of their diverse careers in order to enable widespread recognition of the competences that PhD trainees and postdocs have obtained, both within and outside academia independent of sector or discipline and geographical location. It should be translated in the new European competence framework[2], which will need to be mainstreamed across Europe.
We expect projects to take measures to improve flow-through of talent within academia and to and from the non-academic sector or to other highly needed positions in academia, to (i) improve transferable skills training, involving non-academic actors in education and training of researchers from the onset, (ii) improve talent transfer to actors in the surrounding ecosystem, (iii) improve value creation practices among higher education institutions, (iv) communicate about the competences and qualifications of researchers and their talents to economic actors and society as a whole, (v) initiatives enabling the sustainable and dynamic interaction within and between the ecosystem actors for knowledge production, circulation and use, and stimulating career fluidity through inter-institutional and inter-sectoral mobility (bi-directionally), (vi) embed additional elements in the assessment schemes for both organisations and individuals at all career stages, (vii) propose methodologies on how to introduce skills requirements from the business, social and public sector to academia.
Activities should include the establishment of pilot (for instance) local talent management centres and training hubs that strengthen involvement of the non-academic sector in defining the priorities of researchers’ training and lifelong learning upskilling. Attention should be paid to addressing gender equality related issues throughout the different strands of the proposed framework.
Duration: The action should be no longer than 2 years.

","19 January 2022
","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Consolidation of knowledge and development of guidelines, tools, innovative strategies, and recommendations to improve science communication for all research and innovation actors;
Establishment of a European competence centre for science communication, sustained beyond the lifetime of funding;
Increased networking and mutual learning, higher quality, more trustworthy, and more rapidly mobilised science communication by national authorities, businesses, civil society organisations, other stakeholders and projects.
Scope:
Science communication is a scientific discipline, an activity conducted by career scientists and science outreach organisations, and a specific career pathway followed by journalists. It has the potential to improve science-society relations by increasing the transparency of science, building trust in the processes and outcomes of science, and raising scientific literacy. It can also improve the uptake of science by society and support evidence-based policy making.
Science and science communication have been undergoing radical changes over recent years, creating opportunities that may, in turn, pose new challenges. For instance, traditional media are increasingly being superseded by social media with more user-edited content; rapid diffusion of open access or pre-peer review papers gives the general public access to research that was previously locked behind paywalls; and open data enable a wider set of actors to interact with, analyse and interpret research results than in the past.
The covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of communicating scientific knowledge and recommendations to respond to a fast-moving and critical threat. It is important to learn from this and other experiences when science communication has been essential to conveying scientific knowledge and recommendations on critical issues, to explaining how hypotheses, experiments and uncertainties are also part of the scientific method, to build capacities and strengthen networks, and to ensure greater ability in the future to react rapidly and effectively to critical situations.
This action has two parts, both of which must be addressed:
The first part consists of consolidating the evidence base on science communication from on-going and past projects and initiatives[1], covering a wide range of existing and potential critical areas for research and innovation for society. Particular attention should be paid to contextual issues (geography, gender, age, socio-economic status, etc.) that affect the uptake or effectiveness of science communication. Policy reports and recommendations, guidelines, and innovative strategies should be developed for all research and innovation actor types; potential targets should include government agencies and public authorities, research funding and performing organisations, and civil society organisations. An important outcome should be the publication of one or more user-friendly handbook(s) for effective science communication, backed by an interactive and pedagogical online toolkit, for use by Horizon Europe projects. This part should involve all parts of the quadruple helix[2] in co-creation activities, to ensure that the outcomes are usable in different contexts, for different purposes, and by different research and innovation actors; considerable efforts to disseminate the findings across the European Research Area should be undertaken.
The second part will consist of establishing a centre of knowledge, expertise, advice, resources, and tools on science communication in the European Research Area. It should link to - and support - existing communities of knowledge and practice, with the goal of improving co-ordination and mutual learning between them. It should support potential user groups including R&I projects, public authorities, government agencies, the private sector, and civil society organisations, to improve and initiate trusted and impactful science communication. An important element will be preparing the European Research Area to react quickly to situations requiring science communication, and the ability to provide rapid advice and support, as required. The centre should work towards the sustainability of its activities beyond the lifetime of funding, including through the provision of a basket of services and other activities that have market value; a business plan should therefore be elaborated from the very earliest stages of the project.
The action should build on the knowledge, networks and capacities developed by Horizon 2020[3] and by national and regional initiatives and work closely with relevant projects. A minimum project duration of 4 years should be envisaged.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Advancement of knowledge and practice on gender-responsive innovation in Europe
Strengthening of the innovation and inclusiveness dimensions of the European Research Area.
Scope:
Women remain disproportionately under-represented among innovators and start-up entrepreneurs and hold less than 10% of patent applications[1], while the integration of the gender dimension into product design, technologies and innovations in general, remains very limited despite its potential for opening new markets and its core importance for solving global challenges and European priorities. Moreover, a positive correlation between the European Innovation Scoreboard and the Gender Equality Index has been reported, and a higher proportion of research organisations with a gender equality plan in a given country is similarly correlated with a higher Innovation Score[2].
A “Living Lab” will be put in place, gathering innovators as well as social science and gender scholars to investigate and generate new and disruptive ideas to promote women innovators and develop gender-responsive innovation. This novel knowledge and collaboration scheme will build on projects and actions supported under Horizon 2020, including the EU Prize for Women Innovators and its network of awardees, project GENDERACTION, recommendations from the Horizon 2020 Expert Group to update and expand “Gendered Innovations/Innovation through Gender”[3] and outputs of projects funded under the SwafS-26-2020 (Innovators of the future: bridging the gender gap) topic. It will also complement initiatives led by the European Innovation Council, as well as EIT-led activities aimed at supporting women-led innovation.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Establish a sustainable learning and collaboration hub between various innovation ecosystem actors, including, e.g., women innovators, social innovators, education institutions, science and technology museums, foundations, start-ups and larger companies, as well as social science researchers and gender scholars from a variety of scientific disciplines.
Develop real-life action research with above-mentioned stakeholders, based on the co-development and testing of user-centred and open and social innovation processes promoting gender equal participation, as well as integrating the gender dimension into their contents, with an opening to intersectional approaches considering social categories intersecting with gender such as ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or else social origin. A special focus should be placed on information technology and AI-related fields and Commission priorities such as the European Green Deal and the preparedness and response to future pandemics.
Propose concrete new methods and solutions for the development of gender-responsive innovation in Europe.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Enhance the reputation, attractiveness, inclusiveness and research excellence of less advanced institutions as a result of implementing inclusive gender equality plans.
Transform institutions to advance inclusive gender equality within the European Research Area (ERA).
Scope:
The institutional change strategy implemented through gender equality plans has had very positive impacts in many research organisations and been a catalyser at national and EU level, as the latest ERA progress report has shown. However, there is a heterogeneity in the implementation of Gender Equality Plans across the EU, and persisting structural barriers in R&I institutions which must be addressed, through a renewed approach.
The inclusion scheme aims to strengthen and go beyond the minimum requirements for a Gender Equality Plan (GEP) as defined in Horizon Europe eligibility criteria, and to support the implementation of inclusive GEPs in line with the new ERA Communication and gender equality objectives[1].
Actions should clearly outline the approach for boosting gender equality strategies, including new areas such as intersectionality and diversity, outreach beyond the organisation, gender budgeting, or gender and innovation among others, building on knowledge and expertise developed through related Horizon 2020 projects and tools (e.g. GEAR Tool, ACT Communities of practice). Advanced organisations will mentor on best practices, processes, monitoring and actions to undertake in the inclusive GEPs.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Methods for exchanging and implementing good practices and materials, tailored to individual organisations’ needs for the development of inclusive GEPs;
Support for reinforcing their networking in the area of gender equality and inclusiveness, especially with already existing Communities of Practice;
Activities such as on-site visits, on-site or virtual training; workshops; dissemination and outreach and capacity building activities.
Implementation of specific actions in the less advanced institutions specifically addressing the opening to intersectionality and diversity, including in the integration of intersectional sex and gender analysis into R&I content.
The partners involved in the twinning exercise are expected to revolve either around a specific thematic area or have widening partners with similar national/regional background for a better contextualization.

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects should contribute to the both of following expected outcomes:
Support the European Union’s role in leading the transformation and defence of multilateralism by identifying and analysing policy avenues for a more robust, democratic and effective global governance.
Develop policy recommendations, institutional frames, toolboxes, narratives and methodologies for supporting action towards transnational democracy.
Scope:
Political developments across the world over the last years have posed serious challenges to global multilateralism and its aspirations for global order, peace and cooperation. Even if the need for international collective action is greater than it has ever been (climate and digital transitions, rise of inequalities – including gender inequalities –, ageing and disabilities, migrations, health pandemics, information disorder), the obstacles it encounters are no less redoubtable. The emerging multipolar system is characterised by the prevalence of diverging, and often antagonistic, state preferences, outdated and often ill-equipped global governance institutional architecture, nationalist populism, unilateralist trends, the influence of multinational corporations, as well as neo-mercantilist conflicts.
The European Union has an important global role to play in terms of defending multilateralism, through its enhancement and transformation, as a crucial component of global governance. However, its capacity and influence in shaping globalisation are being shaken by major geopolitical factors, such as the rise of new or re-emerging powers (China, India, Russia) and the United States’ foreign policy shifts.
Taking stock of recent developments, research should propose ways of redesigning, renewing and re-invigorating global and European traditions of cooperation with a view to greater accountability, openness and legitimacy. This should include new reflections on the norms, institutions and actors that can support a more robust and effective multilateralism, as well as a stocktaking and assessment of the modalities and possibilities of multileveled participation in cross-border governance, ranging from the local to the global level. Research should also account for differences between fields and areas of governance, corresponding to diverse levels and modalities of multilateral cooperation. It should analyse whether and how such differences may hamper the governance of intersecting global challenges, e.g. health and mobility in relation to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, sustainability and climate change, and propose ways forward.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following: to identify barriers and opportunities for re-invigorating and enhancing the formal legal and institutional architecture of the rules-based global system. They should analyse, through a mix of normative and empirical methodologies, ways to reinforce the institutions that work, ways to replace those that do not, and propose those that are missing, with the aim of spurring the transformation of global governance. Proposals should relate the capacity of the populist and nationalist actors to feed on sovereigntist claims and narratives about the challenges confronted by supranational integration projects. Comparative approaches at European and global levels should be developed, taking into consideration historical and cultural contexts. Research should identify new actors, norms and processes of participation and representation (such as the participation of local authorities, community-based organisations, trade unions, youth, women’s rights and civil society organisations in general, or citizens themselves through digital means for instance), which can boost the legitimacy, transparency, representativeness and effectiveness of multilateral institutions. Interests and strategies of other international powers, such as the United States, China, India, Russia or of other regional groupings (e.g. Mercosur, ASEAN, African Union) in disseminating new collective norms for global governance, including the related relevant historical roots, should be analysed. Proposals should identify where these interests, strategies and norms are incompatible with EU values and long-term interests and recommend policy action for the European Union to counter them. They should reflect on the changing role of state sovereignty in times of globalisation and global governance and consider different ways of reconceptualising multilateralism in the emerging multipolar global system. International cooperation with partners from third countries of interest is encouraged in order to better achieve the expected outcomes.

The primary goal of Cooperation Partnerships is to allow organisations to increase the quality and relevance of their activities, to develop and reinforce their networks of partners, to increase their capacity to operate jointly at transnational level, boosting internationalisation of their activities and through exchanging or developing new practices and methods as well as sharing and confronting ideas.
They aim to support the development, transfer and/or implementation of innovative practices as well as the implementation of joint initiatives promoting cooperation, peer learning and exchanges of experience at European level. Results should be re-usable, transferable, up-scalable and, if possible, have a strong transdisciplinary dimension.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
Cooperation Partnerships aim at:
* Increasing quality in the work, activities and practices of organisations and institutions involved, opening up to new actors, not naturally included within one sector;
* Building capacity of organisations to work transnationally and across sectors;
* Addressing common needs and priorities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport;
* Enabling transformation and change (at individual, organisational or sectoral level), leading to improvements and new approaches, in proportion to the context of each organisation."

Small-scale Partnerships are designed to widen access to the programme to small-scale actors and individuals who are hard to reach in the fields of school education, adult education, vocational education and training, youth and sport. With lower grant amounts awarded to organisations, shorter duration and simpler administrative requirements compared to the Cooperation Partnerships, this action aims at reaching out to grassroots organisations, less experienced organisations and newcomers to the Programme, reducing entry barriers to the programme for organisations with smaller organisational capacity. This action will also support flexible formats – mixing activities with transnational and national character although with a European dimension – allowing organisations to have more means to reach out to people with fewer opportunities. Small-scale Partnerships can also contribute to the creation and development of transnational networks and to fostering synergies with, and between, local, regional, national and international policies.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
* Attract and widen access for newcomers, less experienced organisations and small-scale actors to the programme. These partnerships should act as a first step for organisations into cooperation at European level.

Projects should contribute to both of the following expected outcomes:
In-depth understanding of the major factors contributing to the present rise of extremist narratives and of their influence on mainstream worldviews, discourses and policies across European countries in their local and global context.
Formulation of multi-level policy recommendations to help counter these extremist narratives while limiting their spread and impact.
Scope:
The COVID-19 crisis risks further strengthening extreme political narratives that have already been rising starkly across Europe. These narratives fuel the demand for more protectionism, nation-state localisation of production and tougher frontier controls, while depicting foreigners as a threat to national wellbeing. On an ideological plane, political extremists often show disdain for the rights and liberties of others but resent the limitations of their own activities. More extreme forms embrace engagement in ideologically driven criminal activity and violence.
Some of the greater impacts of extreme narratives on society stem from their influence on mainstream political discourses and policies. This phenomenon is notably reflected by alarming outcomes in national and European opinion polls and elections. Therefore, the phenomenon seems to belong to a wider trend and should be analysed in its local and global contexts, including in connection with the strengthening of authoritarian, populist and extremist discourses in some countries. Certain anti-democratic sentiments also seem to be connected to and nurtured by conspiracy theories, possible bonds that could be flagged and examined for comprehensive understanding of all interacting factors.
Proposals are expected to address the following: Analyse the various forms of extremist discourses and narratives, their dynamics and disruptive potential. Take into account national specificities – embedded in their historical, social and cultural contexts – and transnational influences, within Europe and globally. Provide psychological, sociological and anthropological analyses of drivers behind violent political transformations. Explore the tension between tackling political extremism and human rights law on freedom of speech. Map the penetration of extremist ideology and argumentation into general media, social and political discourses. Proposals should analyse the drivers of such discourses, including the respective roles of the media, political spheres and popular sentiment and their interplay. They should propose evidence-based strategies to counter extremist discourses, prevent the spread of political extremism and limit its short and long- term impact. The action should develop corresponding policy recommendations.[1]

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects should contribute to both of the following expected outcomes:
Achieve a better understanding of gendered power relations across the social and economic spheres, taking into account intersections between gender and other social categories such as ethnicity, social origin, disability and sexual orientation, and the cumulative effects of multiple forms of discrimination and disadvantages. Provide evidence base about the role of education and the media in perpetuating or breaking stereotypes.
Help reverse socio-economic and cultural inequalities and promote gender equality, thus supporting the realisation of the global 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls.
Scope:
Full gender equality in the distribution and concentration of power in all political, social, cultural and economic spheres is far from being realised: in EIGE’s Gender Equality Index 2020, the domain of Power scores the lowest across all six domains with an EU average of only 53.5 out of 100. Gendered power relations do not only concern decision-making and politics, but are also reflected in our everyday lives, including in the workplace, academia, arts and culture, the private and public spheres, education and early-childhood socialisation. While there has been much research on inequalities and power relations in these different areas, this has not always translated into practical, sustainable and structural change on policy and societal level. In the light of economic crises, pandemics, and the climate emergency, it is crucial to re-examine these power relations and provide innovative solutions and policy responses to advance women’s empowerment.
Proposals are expected to address the following: Propose a theoretical framework to understand the formation of gendered power hierarchies leading to systematic and structural forms of discriminations, social and economic inequalities and gender-based violence. This should feed into developing solutions on how to address inequalities and underlying causes related to society’s perception and construction of gender norms, masculinities, femininities and gender diverse identities. Consider how intersectionality of gender with, e.g., ethnicity, social origin, religion, disability, and sexual orientation impacts one’s position and rights in society and social hierarchy, as well as one’s life and career choices.
Proposals should analyse the interrelations of power and barriers to gender equality between different social and economic issues including, inter alia: policy- and decision-making, labour market participation and the gender pay gap, workplace and work-life balance arrangements, gender-based and domestic violence, reproductive rights, gender roles in education, and cultural representations, including in art and the media. Particular attention should be paid to differing cultural contexts across the EU and among Associated and third countries studied, as well as to specific contexts of economic crises, pandemics, climate change, and the ‘future of work’. The action should propose concrete, practical solutions, innovative tools and policy responses to dismantle structural and systematic roots of unequal power distribution between women and men on all levels and promote women’s social and economic empowerment. To achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, as well as the development of social innovation approaches, which can foster new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Build robust evidence base for redesigning curricula in support of democracy, with an emphasis on students’ active participation and engagement in this process.
Toolkits for enhancing the humanistic and civic aspects of education with a view to promoting active democratic citizenship and empowerment, including through experimental approaches.
Strengthened democratic processes in education through the involvement of citizens in defining educational contents, learning environments and goals.
Scope:
Education, from early childhood to lifelong learning, plays an important role in bolstering democratic citizenship and strengthening the resilience of democratic societies. It can play an essential role in the promotion of core values like human rights and the rule of law, as well as in the prevention of human rights violations. It can also help promote gender equality, disability inclusiveness, a culture of peace and non-violence, environmental awareness, appreciation of linguistic, ethnic, cultural and religious diversity. Education can contribute to tackle radicalisation and successfully integrate migrants and refugees.
Research shows that voters with more extreme attitudes are overrepresented among citizens with low formal education and a below-average household income. Populist discourses and extremist groups find more support among citizens who benefit less from cultural modernisation, economic liberalisation and internationalisation.
Involvement of citizens and young people, including through NGOs, social partners and grassroots organisations, and cooperation with cultural and creative sectors are strongly encouraged to ensure the achievement of expected outcomes.
Proposals are expected to show how educational material and innovative pedagogical practices in different settings (including lifelong learning), can mediate or inform current debates about European identity, as well as key issues such as sustainable development, migration, tolerance and understanding of ethnocultural and linguistic diversity, international solidarity and global citizenship, inequality, disability, hate speech, polarisation and extremisms, ethnicity/race, religion and gender, etc. They should examine how education can be mobilised in terms of producing informed historical and cultural consciousness by contributing to cultural and textual literacy, critical and analytic historical learning, responsible historical consciousness and critical thinking of the future citizens of democratic societies. Research should highlight the competences needed by students for boosting their capacity to actively engage in democratic politics, to understand and reflect on global interconnections, unequal power relations, depletion of natural resources and climate change, and to contribute to the promotion of sustainable development, inclusion, anti-racism, equality, justice and peace. Corresponding methods to guide teaching and assessment of those competences should be investigated, gathered and analysed. Research should propose avenues for updating and developing novel curricula and learning environment. It should also propose ways to support teaching staff, with a view to bolstering democratic values, critical thinking skills and positive social engagement in a holistic way. Provide comprehensive evidence from European countries on the links between economic, social, cultural capital and educational inequalities and levels of political engagement, social trust, participation and inter-cultural tolerance. Experimental participatory research to test educational and training tools and to demonstrate the impact of the tools proposed, including students’ and teachers’ feedback, should be included. In particular, proposals should examine new (including blended) education and training formats that incorporate creative approaches such as gamification, design of virtual classrooms and virtual co-working spaces, and other cultural expressions like literacy interpretation, creative writing or theatre, in order to reach target groups in an effective and innovative way.

Improved quality, accountability and transparency of media production and distribution processes, and contribution to a more resilient democratic institutional framework.
Enhanced citizen’s participation and decision-making through enlightened access to pluralistic media content.
Scope:
A robust, independent and transparent media landscape ensuring a plurality of views is an essential part of a functioning democracy. Through control and criticism, offering a stage for the competition of ideas and interests and promoting political participation, inclusion and responsible action of citizens, the media can be a powerful source of legitimation and external check on incumbent authorities. As recalled by the recent European Democracy Action Plan adopted by the European Commission[1], media plays a central role as the “fourth pillar of democracy” by informing citizens and holding public institutions and businesses to account as well as by enhancing democratic values such as pluralism and tolerance.
Media accountability (enacted by mechanisms such as press and media councils, ombudspersons, etc.) and professional journalism have a key role in democratic societies for safeguarding a free and responsible media. In light of an increased economization of media communication, increased market concentration, and the accelerated technological changes including automatised content selection and sharing processes, the established system of media accountability seems to be at a crossroads that requires innovative ideas for improvement. Research should thus examine the political role of traditional and new digital media in performing key democratic functions and reaching out to all segments of society, including women as well as minorities and disadvantaged groups. The cultural and creative sectors may be actively involved in the research.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following: they should examine under what conditions, including training, career and working conditions, traditional and new media organizations and journalism operate in modern European societies. Research should analyse whether and how they serve the public interest, and how this could be improved through better training, reinforcing ethical standards and competences (including those related to journalists' professional dilemmas), media regulation and rules, and cooperation between stakeholders (including professional training institutions, media houses, industry). Proposals should focus on the implications of modern, technologically mediated configurations for the political agency of citizens. Relevant foci could be media participation and civic engagement, journalists’ professional and ethical standards, the role of education and training in fostering critical media literacy, persuasive technology, inequality (including gender inequality) and exclusion, institutional politics and activism, and populism. Changes in media markets and the role of economic, commercial, technological as well as political forces in shaping current changes in the role of media should be analysed. Proposals should bring together, in a holistic manner, academic research, practitioners’ reflection, and citizens’ views on the relationship between media and democracy. They should analyse how recent transformations in journalism and media technology have affected individuals and communities concerning participation and democratic discourses and, conversely, how a shifting political landscape, with increased polarisation as a major trait, have affected the media. Research should propose digital media design improvements that effectively increase transparency and accountability of media and contribute to reinvigorating democracy.

Projects should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:
Protect fundamental rights and European values from possible threats stemming from unregulated use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data applications.
Explore the potential of AI and big data to reinforce fundamental rights and European values. Examine the effectiveness of monitoring and control protocols of established legislation and non-regulatory measures over AI and big data development and implementations.
Introduction of values-based frameworks to inform data governance and regulate the use of AI and big data.
Innovative uses of AI and big data to enhance citizen engagement and democracy.
Scope:
Big data and AI are shaping our societies at an unprecedented rate. We produce an ever-increasing amount of data revealing people’s attitudes, preferences, views and opinions. Public and private actors collect it and use it in multiple ways: e.g. companies “privatise” data to augment commercial returns while, on the other hand, state actors can use it for safety and security applications and the public sector to provide better, tailored services to citizens.
AI and big data open great opportunities in many fields of public interest: education, training, health, safety and security, public services, as well as for democratic processes and civic participation. However, both private and public uses contain some risks at the expense of citizens’ rights. These technologies, being at the forefront of datafication processes, pose new challenges both to core individual values such as privacy, freedom and equality, as well as to European collective values, such as fairness, security, inclusiveness, accountability and democratic control.
Proposals should analyse challenges and opportunities for society brought about by AI and big data. They should explore how to protect citizens from potential abuse enabled by these technologies both in the private and public domains. New and established regulations to control platforms using these technologies (beyond GDPR) should be examined. Strategies and policy recommendations on how to ensure that philosophical, legal and ethical values are embedded in the development of these technologies as outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence – a European approach to excellence and trust[1], are sought.
Examination should lead to solutions protecting from the possible negative impacts of these technologies on fundamental rights and democracy. Equally, it should lead to strategies that leverage them for enhancing civic participation and democracy.
Issues at stake include, inter alia: data ownership and/or inalienability; regulation of data flows; neutrality and explainability of algorithms and machine learning; value-centric, decentralised and/or open source designs for data processing platforms; counter-powers to dominant platforms; sensitive applications such as face recognition; etc.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following points: To build evidence, to review and to analyse threats to and opportunities for democracy, personal and collective European values stemming from AI and big data. This should involve a specific focus on gender issues and vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities and people at risk of discrimination. They should propose ethical standards enforced through regulatory and governance frameworks. Supported with operational guidance, they should help protect citizens, uphold European values and ensure public trust in AI and the processing of big data. Innovative, inclusive and participative uses of AI and big data for civic engagement and democracy, including through experimental approaches, should be explored. Research is expected to design ways to educate European citizens about these technologies to enable informed civic participation in shaping them. Projects should build on existing results, findings and good practices, for instance those focused on Responsible Research and Innovation, and relevant projects supported under Horizon 2020’s Science with and for Society programme.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Comprehensive evidence base to explain the long-term impact of various inequalities (socio-economic, gender, disability, spatial, ethnic, etc.) on political participation, democratic quality and stability.
Development, validation and piloting of strategies, policies and action plans for tackling inequalities while boosting trust and resilience at different levels of governance, including at the local level.
Strategies, regulations and policies to support the inclusion of marginalised groups in the democratic and participatory process.
Scope:
Citizens, especially in certain social groups, have been experiencing an erosion in living standards over the past decades. This process has persisted during the financial recovery and is likely to worsen following the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, social mobility stalled and the impact of inequalities increased. This has reinforced sentiments of public distrust towards the political institutions of democracy. European research suggests that a shrinking of private and public resources due to economic downturns can lead to disenchantment from politics, and even to a general deterioration of the rule of law. Moreover, persistent inequality has lifelong effects for children and undermines the ability of the more socially vulnerable and excluded to participate meaningfully in the political process, while economically powerful actors gain a greater influence. Social, economic, spatial, ethnic or gender inequalities often translate into political inequalities, especially if different areas of inequality (e.g. in economic opportunities, access to education, health and social security) are overlapping. There is a danger of having a long-lasting fissure in the egalitarian ethos of democracy produced by the almost permanent political exclusion of wide social groups. Particular attention should be paid to children and youth, who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of recession, and for whom the structuring effects of inequality and unequal opportunities may have lasting consequences in terms of education, work and life chances.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following points: To take stock of long-term trends in and types of inequalities (socio-economic, gender, age, spatial, digital gaps, ethnic, linguistic, etc.), as well as to identify the sources of these inequalities and the way they intersect. Proposals should model the relation between inequalities and levels of political trust in European societies and the emergence of protest movements and populist discourses, including in their national, transnational and spatial dimensions. What set of policy actions can enhance equality and political engagement amongst the socially excluded and vulnerable, including children and youth? The processes that allow or prevent these groups’ interests and demands from entering the political agenda should be examined. Research should relate different kinds of policies (economic, access to education, housing, employment, etc.) and the role of public services, including digital ones, to levels of democratic legitimacy and trust among different social groups, including with a spatial perspective (e.g. rural vs urban). It should also relate the structure of political representation (e.g. how much are governments, parties, parliaments, etc. representative of different social categories; the discourses of major political agents and their social relevance) to levels of political engagement and democratic legitimacy.
Based on the evidence collected and analysed, proposals should develop validation and piloting of strategies, policies and actions to tackle inequalities and to reinforce the inclusion of marginalised groups in the democratic and participatory process, including increased involvement of marginalised groups in the creation of digital public services. Active involvement of citizens and socially innovative approaches are strongly encouraged.

Identify suitable theoretical and application-oriented concepts that foster inclusion in the labour market.
Develop innovative policy approaches to promote inclusion, inclusiveness and quality employment of the considered groups.
Help develop evidence-based policy responses to fight discrimination and promote inclusion and upward convergence in employment.

Identify and compare the usefulness of different options for policies and measures.
Identify relevant actors to achieve effective results (institutions at different scales, civil society organizations, etc.) and explore their roles and interaction.
Scope:
New and innovative ways of integration into the labour market of the most vulnerable groups need to be explored and tested with the objective to reduce inequalities and promote social inclusion. These vulnerable groups include people discriminated on the basis of disability and health, age, gender, language, racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil and family status and religious belonging. As an important basis for this, suitable theoretical inclusion concepts should be identified and developed, such as e.g. interoperable and comparative European indicators and standards. Research should identify barriers for increasing inclusiveness in the labour market, covering elements such as disability and health, age, gender, language, racial or ethnic origin (exploring for example factors such as accent, name or looking biases in hiring contexts), sexual orientation, civil and family status including caring responsibilities (e.g. mothering) and religious belonging, with regard to both quantity and quality of employment. Research activities should take a holistic approach (e.g. taking into account increasing accessibility across-the-board; availability of assistive technologies, the level of provided reasonable accommodation and supported employment for persons with disabilities; developing collective agreements tackling economic, employment and welfare inequality by gender and vulnerable group, and considering also causes originating in the education system).
Research should address the disadvantages and barriers faced, collect data on measures to improve the situation, and provide a thorough analysis of the impact and efficacy of existing policy measures, such as positive discrimination provisions and quotas. For example, in the case of people with disabilities, research should take stock of the reasonable accommodation tools and support provided across Member States and Associated Countries to compile a comprehensive catalogue. Proposals should also include a focus on ethnic/racial discrimination at times of pandemics such as COVID-19, and longer-term implications. Proposals may include also a focus on specific segments of labour markets, like domestic work, care work, courier and delivery services, garbage collection and commercial employees, highlighted during the COVID-19 crisis.
Research should also involve employers, including SMEs, and address their potential concerns. Civil society organisations representing those vulnerable groups, as well as trade unions should also be involved. The role of educational institutions, work integration social enterprises, the family and family associations, supporting the most vulnerable groups on their way towards inclusion in the labour market, should be considered. Where relevant, synergies and complementarities with other projects selected under this topic and under the topic on “Gender and social, economic and cultural empowerment” should be maximised.
Research is also expected to address the issue of social protection against the hazards of labour market. For example, proposals could consider the in and out of employment and the possible compatibility with other benefits, such as disability benefits avoiding the benefit trap.

Projects should contribute to both of the following expected outcomes:
Enable policymakers to better understand, measure and reduce skills gaps and problematic mismatches between skills and jobs, thereby supporting the diffusion and adoption of innovation, the digital and green transitions, inclusive economic growth as well as individual wellbeing.
Support the objectives of the European Skills Agenda for Sustainable Competitiveness, Social Fairness and Resilience as regards Vocational Education and Training (VET) and Adult Learning (AL).
Scope:
A considerable proportion of businesses in the EU report difficulties finding staff with adequate skills and consider the lack of skilled workers as one of their biggest challenge. At the same time, many young workers in the EU are classified as being overqualified and face a horizontal skills mismatch (i.e. they do not work in an occupation that corresponds to their field of study). In cases where such gaps and mismatches are not a result of individual choice, but rather the consequence of a lack of professional opportunities, of information or coordination, they may hinder the diffusion and adoption of innovation as well as reduce inclusive economic growth and individual wellbeing.
The European Skills Agenda for Sustainable Competitiveness, Social Fairness and Resilience recognises the importance played by cooperation, skills intelligence, VET and AL in ensuring that people – regardless of gender, racial or ethnic origin, disability, religion or belief, age or sexual orientation, and including low-qualified/skilled adults and people with a migrant background – have the right skills to access and progress in the labour market throughout life. To reduce skill gaps, and identify and reduce problematic forms of mismatches in an informed manner, innovative research activities are needed that focus on understanding them both from the supply and demand side. Such activities should look into the roles played by individuals, public and private employers, skills-development institutions and policy frameworks.
For example, research activities carried out under this topic may cover aspects such as the determinants of the choice of VET or study programme by individuals; the coordination, cost sharing and financing instruments for skills development, looking into which instruments lead to which outcomes, and why; the role of employers and work places in the provision of VET and AL. Other researched aspects may be the involvement of employers in defining curricula and organising training; the role of personal attitudes and gender stereotypes, information and structural factors in the decision to seek initial or adult education; the extent to which training balances the provision of general, job-specific and personal development skills (e.g. the levels and gaps of digital skills in the public or private sectors). Finally, proposals may look at the opportunities of informal learning and skills formation provided by workplaces; the coordination at local level between VET institutions, employers, R&I agencies or other public institutions; the interaction of skills development systems and institutions with other domains, in particular innovation and industrial policies, etc.
Where possible and relevant, research should draw lessons from recent policy interventions in a contextual manner, and propose adjustment measures, or test them through social innovation experiments.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Understand the changes wrought on democratic processes by new technologies.
Produce evidence-based recommendations to address the opportunities and challenges for political behaviour and democratic engagement presented by social platforms and new media.
Enhance capacities for digital citizenship.
Scope:
Social media and other internet-based platforms are intertwined with political life. They play an important role in allowing people to design, consume and share political news, seek political information and discuss, make decisions, donate money, or engage with political parties and other organisations. Furthermore, these platforms and media are supposed to open new avenues to political engagement and democratic participation. However, developments in the recent past have created anxieties about their capacity to protect citizens from disinformation and to serve as balanced and open public fora for democratic debates. Social platforms and new media are increasingly perceived as conducive to the creation of ideological “echo-chambers” eroding the space for public dialogue. They are seen as fostering polarisation, radicalisation, depoliticisation, spreading misinformation and subject to manipulation. At the same time, they have been used in attempts to covertly influence the political choices of citizens, thus sapping their democratic credentials.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following: they should build Europe-wide evidence on the extent to which political opportunities and information offered by platforms and new media – and resulting impacts, such as the “echo-chambers” effect – affects political attitudes in European states and at the level of the EU and its neighbourhood. Whether and how new media functions as a new level of news selection and study the resulting perception biases with citizens should be assessed. Research should examine the extent to which platforms and new media actually help democratise political systems and offer avenues of active engagement, or hinder participation for some. The effects of the replacement of media consumption with content consumption should also be examined. Proposals should investigate how audiences of different ages, different genders and different socio-economic and ethnolinguistic groups receive and assess information on digital platforms, and how political actors use these platforms to shape political behaviour. They should propose and design regulatory innovations in response to the covert use of social platforms for political goals. Evidence-based approaches and methods for enhancing capacities for digital citizenship, including media education, media competences, and digital literacy should be developed. Insight about the effects of social media on social behaviour should be attained. Citizen science and other innovative and participatory forms of research could be appropriate for this action.[1]

Projects should contribute to both of the following expected outcomes:
Enhance and expand the implementation of civic participation as well as co-creation in democratic life at scale, including the least engaged communities and categories of the population, at all levels from local to European.
Improve the articulation between deliberative processes and representative institutions in liberal democracies, including through experimental approaches. Research should elucidate how to open up traditional institutions of representative democracy and increase trust in democratic governance through direct participatory processes as well as clear and transparent feedback mechanisms to citizens.
Scope:
Civic participation is researched through a significant number and variety of projects under Horizon 2020, including research on co-creation of digital public services with citizens, on which further research and innovation can build. At the same time, this is a fast moving field as spontaneous forms of participation continue to emerge, such as youth movements for climate and sustainability, movements for racial justices and innovative forms of participation such as citizens’ assemblies. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis is continuously demonstrating the extent to which science and innovation policy needs to be at the core of exchanges between citizens and government through a participatory political process. This also includes the need to use digital means to engage citizens as societies are urged to move online and the need to engage citizens in the rapid digitalisation of governments as a reaction to the COVID-19 crisis. Social entrepreneurship is another significant trend attempting to achieve societal or political impact through individual initiative. More digital and organised participatory and deliberative processes are also being tested and implemented in many local, national and even European and global contexts.
The interface between these movements and processes and the representative institutions of liberal democracies has often been chaotic or conflictual. However, attempts are also made to improve these interactions and embed them in formal mechanisms. The digitalisation of societies and their governments poses an opportunity to reinforce civic participation.
Major challenges to civic participation include engaging the disenfranchised, structurally marginalised, or less spontaneously engaged parts of society, and channelling protest into non-conflictual, constructive engagement. Reaching out to them and ensuring that their voices are heard and listened to in the democratic debate, is key to guarantee the fairness and inclusiveness of our political systems.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following points: To review available historical evidence and more recent experience with various forms of civic participation in Europe: from spontaneous forms of engagement to organised participatory and deliberative processes; from traditional types such as participation to political parties and organised civil society to newer ones such as social entrepreneurship and digital tools of civic participation; the role of formal and informal grassroots initiatives; the role of social media and new technology in civic engagement; the use of public spaces. It is strongly encouraged to cover different scales of participation, from local to national, European and even global. Analysis is expected to review and compare the forms, depth and effectiveness of civic engagement on different topics of political life and different stages of the policy-making process, ranging from local issues such as spatial planning to international policy matters and issues traditionally considered as ‘reserved’ to experts or policy professionals, such as agenda setting in research and innovation policy making. Research should apply foresight methodologies to study how civic participation could be impacted by future changes in global governance and the increased digitalisation of societies and their governments. How different types of civic engagement can complement and reinforce each other may be explored. Consider as well how the educational system can support inclusive citizenship, with a view to ensure as extensive, inclusive and impactful participation in all aspects of democratic life.
Proposals should include a specific focus on inequalities in civic participation, including ethnicity, gender, intersectionalities and digital divides, and explore and propose remedies. They should examine how civic participation and co-creation in its various forms, including social activism and social innovation, articulates with the traditional mechanisms and institutions of representative democracy, including acting outside them. Proposals should reflect on the potential of digitalisation and new ICT for enhancing citizen participation, including for public policy making processes. They should propose ways to improve the interaction between policymakers and citizens to enhance the public sphere, including robust and transparent mutual feedback between policymakers and citizens. Proposals are encouraged to include experimental research and design thinking to test the insights gathered and to deploy innovative solutions to demonstrate the solutions proposed. Social innovation might be also considered by proposals if solutions require social change, new social practices or social ownerships.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhance EU migration policy by shedding light on micro- and meso-level drivers of migration.
Assess how far policies take into account behaviours of migrants when aiming at regulating migration.
Show how migration decisions change along the journey, and at what stage policies are more likely to play a role in shaping migration outcomes.
Scope:
Studies on macro-level determinants of migration have linked structural factors and a number of social processes to migration outcomes. However, there is a scarcity of research that considers the way in which meso-social and micro-individual levels interact with each other and with macro-level determinants, and play a role in shaping decisions to migrate, or not.
Proposals should develop analyses of decisions taken by individuals to stay in their place of origin (village, city, country and region) or to leave. They should therefore consider the individual micro-level of decision-making, and should also consider the timing of such decisions and the drivers of the aspiration to migrate or lack thereof. Proposals should also take into consideration individual perceptions of structural factors (e.g. socio-economic, political, climate-related) and the way in which they influence such decisions.
Proposals should also combine such micro-level analyses with meso-level considerations of the context in which such decisions are formed, with due attention for differences across socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. gender, age, education level, socioeconomic status, ethnicity). Research may take stock of the available literature on the role family households play in shaping decisions to migrate, but is encouraged to go beyond, looking at societal drivers including local, regional and national politics and dynamics, events, narratives, histories and cultural and diaspora ties.
Proposals should also consider how decisions to migrate are dynamic and adapt to different contexts in time and place. In such sequence of decisions, different drivers of decision-making may intervene at the different phases of the migration cycles and journeys, which proposals should consider. Consideration should be given to the role played by the availability, or lack of, legal channels for migration, when opting for an irregular alternative, and the information available on such options. Proposals may also focus, where relevant, on the role of smuggling and trafficking networks and on past experiences and traditions of return migration.
The analyses developed should shed light on the capacity of migration policies to effectively shape and/or affect migration journeys, and at what stage this occurs or may occur. Analyses should also evaluate the extent to which policies implemented consider the behaviours of migrants. Projects are strongly encouraged to develop innovative and participatory methodologies, including behavioural approaches to studies of individual decision-making. International cooperation is strongly advised, in particular with African countries.

High levels of racism, xenophobia, as well as institutionalised or structural discrimination are linked to inequality and shape social and economic outcomes of individuals from minority backgrounds. They also have negative effects on security, quality of life and social cohesion.
Proposals should analyse the working, learning, living, environmental, health and social care conditions of people from minority or migrant descent in the EU and other countries involved in the study, with the aim of countering institutional racism in both the provision of and access to basic services as well as in access to the job market or education. They should analyse and illustrate examples of the relation between structural inequalities and structural discrimination. The analysis may include comparisons with other structurally similar groups within the same and in other countries. An analysis of existing anti-racist and anti-discrimination legislation is desirable, with a view to identifying ways in which these might be strengthened.
Proposals should investigate minorities’ experience of discrimination and how the latter is generated, also by comparative research. Proposals may also document their strategies, achievements and struggles and how their knowledge can enrich policy and research and improve public awareness.
Proposals should focus on various manifestations of racism and xenophobia, including one or more among anti-Black, anti-migrant, anti-Muslim, antisemitism, anti-Gypsyism. In doing so, they should take into account national specificities and intersectionality with gender/sexuality, religion, disability and other dimensions of discrimination. Proposals may also include analyses of how the COVID-19 pandemic differentially impacted such groups, aggravating already existing marginalisation.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Analyse the impacts of ageing societies on productivity, society, employment (by gender, sector, occupational group and skills needed), investment, growth, healthcare systems, access to (digital) public services and public finance sustainability in the medium and long term, while maintaining service adequacy.
Propose knowledge-based policy measures to reap the benefits of longer healthy life expectancy and explore ageing related phenomena, including (but not limited to) cultural factors, fertility, migration, family care, fight against ageism, active ageing, upskilling and reskilling policies.
Counteract the effects of ageism and age segregation, while promoting the benefits of experience and knowledge accumulation drawing on inclusive and dialogic approaches, including through job design that is appropriate to job holders and that builds on their experience.
Scope:
Proposals should analyse, with an interdisciplinary approach, the changing demographic profile of Europe, paying attention to the heterogeneous trends and developments in the different Member States and Associated countries (ideally at regional level), taking into account both the ageing of populations and the demographic consequences of migration. The project should try to assess how this change will affect consumption, production and opportunities.
Projects should consider the structural changes required to adapt in the medium term to ageing societies. They should analyse intergenerational solidarity policies as a possible solution to the major challenges posed by ageing societies.
Research should analyse the impact of demographic change on skills availability and needs, assessing the risk of older aged workers to become obsolescent in a fast changing globalised, individualised, digitalised and automated environment, against the need of investing in them to lengthen working life and try to maintain high levels of productivity in the EU. Research may include consideration for the assets older workers have because of their experience, and the discrimination they may suffer in the labour market. In this context, projects should also consider how recruiting foreign labour may mitigate the shortages in sectors of the economy, and assess the sustainability of this against the needs of EU Member States and contribute to improved dependency ratios. Additional attention should also be paid to the subsequent influence that this foreign recruitment may have on labour conditions, as well as considering the age structure of migrants and the consequence this has.
Projects should consider the opportunities of the ‘silver economy’, not only in terms of consumption of goods, services and innovations directed to the older age population, but also in terms of production. Proposals should consider potential opportunities arising from adapting jobs to an ageing workforce, making the most of the available experience. This entails considering the potential of older people for generating new economic opportunities through their work, their societal engagement (e.g. in the third and fourth sector of the economy) and the conditions by which older people are likely to want to work for longer, and the impact of this on the sustainability of the silver economy.
Together with considering such medium term dynamics, proposals may also consider the longer-term implications of ageing societies, and factors mitigating it. Research may consider gaps, opportunities and best practices regarding inclusive digital public services (including co-creating digital public services with the elderly), so ageing societies can reap the benefits of the digitalisation of the public sector. Fertility may be considered by analysing the impact of labour market policies, family policies, housing policies and conditions under which both men and women are more likely to have children. Projects may investigate whether the decline in fertility has structural causes, or if the general attitudes and willingness to have children have declined. Proposals may also look at the conditions that facilitate having the number of children desired, and investigate which measures stimulate which groups.
Proposals should develop recommendations on how European societies need to cope with demographic changes in the short and medium term, with the reforms needed to ripen the economic benefits and limit the negative consequences, including in relation to societal values, also with reference to global examples. They should also consider how to do this while developing a long-term perspective aimed at increasing the EU’s human capital.

","20 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects should contribute to both of the following expected outcomes:
Comprehensive evidence on the mid- to long-term impacts of current political and social developments on European representative democracies.
Develop policy recommendations, toolkits, narratives and methodologies for enhancing trust in political institutions, and boosting transparency, representativeness, and inclusiveness of representative systems at local, regional, national and EU level.
Scope:
The last decades have witnessed significant changes in the electoral behaviour of citizens. Turnout has been steadily declining in most countries while European research and statistical data show that there is more electoral volatility, together with an increase in radicalisation of voter attitudes and greater polarisation. From 1994 to 2017 (according to Eurobarometer data[1]) trust in parliaments, political parties and governments declined significantly. On the other hand, paradoxically, non-elected institutions (e.g. military, police, and judiciary) enjoyed high and relatively stable levels of trust, higher than the democratically elected ones. As societies have become more connected and individualistic, with an ever fast-paced development of digital technologies, new political forces, discourses and voting preferences have emerged. While many of the identities and certainties of the past are eroding, new cleavages have marked the political landscape of representative democracies.
This apparent state of flux brings multiple challenges but also opportunities for the future of our democracies.
Proposals are expected to address some of the following: to create a robust and comprehensive knowledge base on long-term developments in terms of trust in, and trustworthiness of, the political institutions of representative democracy – parties, executives, parliaments, judiciary, social partners, institutionalised social dialogue, etc. – and their legitimacy. Proposals should relate changing voting attitudes at the individual level to wider political and cultural discourses, where feelings and emotions can compete and overrule facts and reasons, and to the emergence of new social movements and parties. They should analyse key drivers of such changes, taking into consideration socio-economic variables (including transformation in the world of work), as well as cultural variables linked to identity, generational differences, gender, ethnic diversity, security, migration and the material forms of discourse such as education and media. The political cleavages that shape current political phenomena and trace their connection to historical legacies as well as their foreseeable negative and positive long-term impacts on democratic systems should be analysed.
Based on the evidence collected and analysed, proposals should develop new approaches to understand the evolution of political parties in the context of intense digitalisation (including of the public space and public institutions) and individualism. They should examine the barriers and opportunities to re-invigorating and enhancing representative democratic systems. Strategies to address the demands and needs of citizens expressed in other, non-electoral forms of political participation, with a view to active engagement and inclusion, including the use of digital tools for citizen engagement should be provided. Research should develop a comprehensive and transparent toolbox of possible policy interventions including but not limited to recommendations, toolkits and methodologies for enhancing trust in political institutions, boosting transparency, representativeness and inclusiveness of representative systems. In all cases, comparative approaches at EU level, taking also into consideration the changing demographic composition of populations, should be developed.
The actions should strive to include citizens and civil society at all stages of the research activities, by means of consultation, structured dialogue, action research, social experimentation and/or other active methodologies that the proponents consider as most effective.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
An empirical analysis of different processes of economic growth, identifying the extent to which they are inclusive and sustainable (determinants of social, economic inclusion and environmental impacts).
A theoretical assessment of the linkages between the standard economic growth paradigm and the dimensions of sustainable development (social, economic, health and environmental).
Pave out possible avenues for the taking up of a novel growth framework to support inclusive and sustainable policies.
Scope:
The RIA should support the transition towards a “sustainability paradigm”, identifying the socio-economic inequalities and the distribution of benefits of economic growth between individuals, also taking into account the environmental impacts and limits of such growth. The action should use macro and/or micro data to identify the distributive effects of economic growth in terms of income and wealth, identifying which population groups benefitted or not and the related determinants. Proposals should cover a broad range of European countries (also the regional dimension where appropriate), as well as a sufficient number of non-European countries (e.g. from Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America) for ensuring an international comparison of the analysis, thus international cooperation is strongly encouraged. Proposals should include any potential relationship that the transition towards a “sustainability paradigm” might have with notions of environmental justice and injustice, seeking out any individuals who might be negatively impacted by the transition and ensure the inclusion of their perspectives. The analysis may take into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
Research efforts should identify and propose indicators to measure well-being and sustainable development, accounting also for the measurement framework in the “beyond GDP” approaches. In particular, proposals should reconcile the new sustainable development goals (no poverty, environmental and climate hazards, societal cohesion and inclusion, good health, human well-being and gender equality) with the standard framework (productivity and consumption as the main objectives and metrics of economic growth) improving the critical understanding of the trade-offs and synergies. Project activities can also include the development of indicators for that purpose. The proposals should address the following questions: Is it possible to reconcile sustainability targets with productivity growth? How is social and economic inclusion and inequality affected? How can we drive the transition from a carbon-based linear, not sustainable economy to a carbon-free circular, sustainable well-being economy? Research may develop a platform in collaboration with relevant stakeholders to promote integrated thinking by combining financial, social and environmental returns, including disciplines as finance, economics, sustainability and environmental studies, strategic management, sociology and law.
Finally, proposals should assess possible ways to adopt such new economic development framework, identifying policy options and regulatory solutions to address the trade-offs and synergies for the transition towards a sustainable and competitive development path (i.e. competitive sustainability), ensuring economic and social inclusion for more resilient societies.
International cooperation with partners from third countries, e.g. with Africa is encouraged.

Envisage policies that counter brain drain and labour exploitation phenomena and enhance joint building of human capital across regions and countries.
Identify effective policies to promote rural development and sustainability and address regional inequalities.
Scope:
Proposals should analyse drivers and effects of demographically declining and left behind areas in Europe. They may develop a typology of such areas that would help in developing policies best aligned with the needs of different areas. Projects should focus in particular on spatial mobility, including, but not limited to, urban-rural, inter-regional and intra-EU mobility, and the interactions of different policies affecting these flows, as well as linkages to mobility flows of non-European migrants. The proposals should assess, in an interdisciplinary way, the pros and cons of spatial mobility from an individual, economic, labour market and administrative perspective in both sending and receiving areas, in order to provide a new framework to understand these flows. Different temporal forms of mobility, such as circular, chained, short term and permanent, should be addressed, as well as differences between labour, student, life style, leisure and retirement motivated mobility. Proposals should also include considerations on the circulation of workers in the EU and on the disruption caused by the COVID-19 emergency and its impact on European borders and freedom of movement.
Proposals should analyse the relation between freedom of movement within or between EU Member States and Associated Countries and the development of both sending and receiving areas, taking into account demographic and historical trends, gender, age, social and labour market characteristics. Research should focus on practices that lead to synergetic benefits for both areas concerned, going beyond a framework of mobility with winners and losers. Proposals should include a focus on the return of individuals to their place and/or country of origin, on the conditions upon which this occurs and to the benefits that this may lead to. Proposals should also consider determinants of immobility, and study patterns, drivers and effects of mobility in conjuncture to analyses of those individuals that under the same circumstances decide not to move. Projects analysing these elements should also consider the impact of such forms of mobility for the livelihoods of individuals moving and of those who stay.
Proposals should help policymakers developing policies that contribute harnessing the positive elements of mobility and may limit the negative effects. They should do so by considering the different types of areas of origin, and catering for the different needs that these may have. Proposals should select cases from a wide variety of EU and Associated Countries, and comparative research across cases is highly encouraged.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Develop new knowledge on the conditions and vulnerabilities of irregular migrants in the EU, their access to basic rights and services in the EU, their activities and their impact on the labour market.
Enhance EU migration governance by appraising policy responses to irregular migration management and their effect.
Propose policy measures to uphold basic rights of irregular migrants and needs of host communities.
Provide tools and options for enhancing the protection of irregular working migrants, and identify to what extent sectors of the economy rely on their work.
Scope:
Irregular arrivals to the EU have been significant in the past years, often in the context of mixed migration, including significant numbers of asylum seekers. Adding to existing populations of irregular migrants, many are not granted asylum, and as return rates also remain low, it is evident that a sizeable number of migrants remain in irregular status in the EU. This is problematic for the migrants, who are easily exploitable due to their status. This is also problematic for the host country, as irregular migrants participate in the black labour market and largely remain outside of integration pathways. In some cases, this exploitation also applies to intra EU mobile citizens.
Proposals should analyse the conditions of irregular migrants in the EU Member States and Associated Countries, and, where relevant, of intra EU mobile citizens in informal or exploitative conditions. Attention should be paid to conditions for access to basic services and rights, as well as their activities and participation in (informal) labour markets. In analysing the activities and work of irregular migrants (and where relevant of intra EU mobile citizens), proposals should also analyse the reliance of particular sectors of the economy on this irregular workforce, revealing its causes and consequences. Research should include a focus on gender issues, and may also analyse the consequences of irregularity for family members with different status in households. It should develop comparative analyses across the EU Member States and Associated Countries as regards these conditions and activities. Proposals may also include an analyses of legislative frameworks aimed to protect the rights of irregular migrants and/or sanction exploitative employers, as well as their implementation, e.g. migrants’ access to protection.
Proposals may also consider the role of host communities vis-à-vis the presence and needs of irregular migrants living without access to basic rights. They should provide options for enhancing the protection of migrants and those providing assistance to them. These analyses could be enhanced by including a focus on the socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on irregular migrants, their employers and/or those providing assistance to them.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Support EU migration governance by assessing barriers and enablers of its return and readmission policy, and notably as regards obstacles to readmission in the countries of origin.
Suggest avenues for international cooperation on migration between the EU, its Member States and countries of origin and transit of migrants.
Consider alternatives to returning migrants to countries of origin and transit and evaluate human-rights related, political and financial trade-offs of these options.
Develop recommendations based on analyses of stakeholders involved and financial and political costs associated to them.
Develop innovative methodologies to analyse and evaluate negotiation strategies and positions of international actors on migration.
Scope:
Proposals should appraise and consider the drivers and the evidence base behind the EU’s return and readmission policies, and consider the outcome of this focus on return. Research should consider to what extent public attitudes to migration in Europe are susceptible to change in relation to success or failure in return and readmission policies. It should also appraise, if any and where relevant, the role played by return policies in deterring further irregular migration and their compliance to international law in doing so, and their consequence for the fundamental rights of migrants.
Proposals should consider negotiations between the EU and countries of origin and transit, and analyse the barriers and enablers to successful agreements. It may build a typology of reasons that limit the capacity and willingness of origin and transit countries to cooperate and engage in return policies. Proposals may also include considerations of different cooperation outcomes in bilateral relations compared to EU-wide relations on return. In addition, they should also analyse the role played by diaspora groups in shaping the positions of their countries of origin, as well as the role played by the local civil society in this process; primary and participatory research could be relevant in this regard. Proposals may also consider the trade-offs between remittances and readmission that countries of origin face. Proposals should therefore analyse the political construction of discourses on return in non-EU countries, and consider the way these impact on the positions of their governments. These analyses should shed light on the interdependencies between the different policy domains that are increasingly integrated in return and readmission policy, such as, but not limited to, development and trade. To this end, international cooperation is strongly advised, in particular with countries in Africa, and/or Asia, and/or the Middle East.
Proposals should consider policies implemented for those who cannot be returned, and bring forward alternatives. Proposals should also consider if and how return and readmission policies uphold the rights of migrants or contribute to the downgrading of their living conditions. In bringing forward policy suggestions, proposals should specify actors involved in their implementation and the financial and political costs associated to this. Multi-stakeholder and multi-disciplinary approaches should be favoured, to ensure all relevant perspectives are taken into account in the findings and recommendations.

Objectives
ERC Advanced Grants are designed to support excellent Principal Investigators at the career stage at which they are already established research leaders with a recognised track record of research achievements. Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal.
Size of ERC Advanced Grants
Advanced Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of EUR 2 500 000 for a period of 5 years (the maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration).
However, up to an additional EUR 1 000 000 can be requested in the proposal to cover (a) eligible ""start-up"" costs for Principal Investigators moving to the EU or an Associated Country from elsewhere as a consequence of receiving the ERC grant and/or (b) the purchase of major equipment and/or (c) access to large facilities and/or (d) other major experimental and field work costs, excluding personnel costs. (As any additional funding is to cover major one-off costs it is not subject to pro-rata temporis reduction for projects of shorter duration. All funding requested is assessed during evaluation).
Profile of the ERC Advanced Grant Principal Investigator
ERC Advanced Grant Principal Investigators are expected to be active researchers and to have a track record of significant research achievements in the last 10 years which must be presented in the application.
A competitive Advanced Grant Principal Investigator must have already shown a record which identifies them as an exceptional leader in terms of originality and significance of their research contributions.
Principal Investigators of Advanced Grant proposals will be expected to demonstrate a record of achievements appropriate to the field and at least matching one or more of the following benchmarks: 10 publications as main author (or in those fields where alphabetic order of authorship is the norm, joint author) in major international peer-reviewed multidisciplinary scientific journals, and/or in the leading international peer-reviewed journals and peer-reviewed conferences proceedings of their respective field; 3 major research monographs. This benchmark is relevant to research fields where publication of monographs is the norm.
Other alternative benchmarks that may be considered (individually or in combination) as indicative of an exceptional record and recognition in the last 10 years: 5 granted patents; 10 invited presentations in well-established internationally organised conferences and advanced schools; 3 research expeditions led by the applicant Principal Investigator; 3 well-established international conferences or congresses where the applicant was involved as a member of the steering and/or organising committee; International recognition through scientific or artistic prizes/awards or membership in well-regarded Academies or artefact with documented use (for example, architectural or engineering design, methods or tools); Major contributions to launching the careers of outstanding researchers; Recognised leadership in industrial innovation.

For information provision and promotion programmes aiming at increasing the awareness and recognition of Union quality schemes mentioned in Article 5(4)(a) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014:
The objective is to increase the awareness and recognition of the Union quality schemes, namely:
(a) quality schemes: protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) and optional quality terms;
(b) the logo for quality agriculture products specific to the outermost regions of the Union.
One of the expected results is to increase the levels of recognition of the logo associated with the Union quality schemes by the European consumers and increased knowledge of the information the quality schemes aim to provide. According to special Eurobarometer (No 504), only 14% of Europeans consumers recognize the logos of products that benefit from a protected designation of origin (PDO), 20% recognise a protected geographical indication (PGI), and 14% recognise a traditional specialty guaranteed, these being the main Union quality schemes.

Projects should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:
New knowledge on the needs and developments of the European filmmaking industry, including its various sub-sectors of pre-production, production, post-production and distribution.
Provide innovative policy scenarios and tools, including digital ones, for the economic recovery of the sub-sectors affected by the economic recession and the COVID-19 crisis, as well as ways to prevent unemployment in the sector.
Increase further the competitiveness of the European filmmaking industry in the international arena.
Provide evidence of the users/viewers preferences on filmmaking, as well as limitations to identifying their preferences, in order to widen and diversify audiences.
Identify a methodology to better understand the users/viewers preferences on filmmaking.
Promote European cultural activity and cultural diversity.
Scope:
The European filmmaking industry is a significant sector of the cultural and creative industries and an important element of European economic growth and wellbeing. The filmmaking sector encompasses a considerable number of small and medium-size enterprises, which contribute with sizeable revenues to European GDP. The sector’s presence in the international arena is dynamic. Although it is in third position on the global market, certain sub-sectors, such as the European animation sector, have a rapidly increasing capacity. However, the lack of large and vertically integrated groups able to compete internationally, in combination with the nationally-based companies that were seriously affected by the COVID-19 crisis, will make it difficult for several EU companies to remain competitive in the international filmmaking industry.
Therefore, research will examine the state of the art of the European filmmaking industry, in order to analyse limitations, including institutional frameworks that prevent integration and cause fragmentation. Proposals will assess the needs and developments of the European filmmaking industry and address potentialities for further development. Proposals should study the dynamics (e.g. activity, progress) of different sub-sectors of the filmmaking industry, including the sub-sectors of pre-production, production, post-production and distribution, and analyse the reasons why some sub-sectors are less advanced than others. Elements such as geopolitical relationships should also be taken into consideration in the research. In addition, proposals should address the relevant legal framework that the filmmaking industry has to comply with, in particular related to intellectual property protection, and identify the legal challenges that the EU industry might face. A comparative assessment of the international competitiveness of the European filmmaking industry with that of main competitors (such as the USA, China, India, etc.) should be developed.
Proposals should identify and pilot innovative, scalable and sustainable business models, which will enable the creators to make better use of digital and other technologies and further widen their audience. In addition, they should ensure fair competitiveness and distinctness within the European film environment. Research should also identify how the COVID-19 pandemic, the counter measures and the economic recession have affected those sub-sectors and their workforce, including creators and artists, and provide policy scenarios on how the filmmaking sector could face the impacts of an economic recession/crisis, in a cost efficient and effective manner, and by providing fair and sustainable working conditions. Proposals should also investigate the way in which the filmmaking sector can be organised to afford efficiently future economic recession/crisis and unemployment. This might include the identification of technologies that use data lakes, AI, block-chain and other technologies to build new, user-friendly and efficient revenue models around advertising, subscriptions and IPR protection. In this frame, research might consider collaborative platforms, collaborative advertising systems, IPR/copyright tracking systems, common metadata standards, solutions for vertical integration, content aggregation models, common Video on Demand platforms, etc.
Evidence on the users/viewers preferences on filmmaking and on limitations to identify their preferences should be provided, while the proposals should identify a methodology, which will also assess the users/viewers preferences on filmmaking. Proposals should cover the activity of cinematography, as well as the wide domain of filmmaking, including TV, documentary, animation, scientific films, etc. Proposals should provide policy scenarios with recommendations for the increase of the competitiveness of the European filmmaking industry at the international arena, thus promoting the European cultural activity and cultural diversity.

Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Create innovative architectural and design solutions that emphasise the use of new forms and materials in line with the European Green Deal objectives.[1]
Leverage the social function of architecture, arts and design, combining functionality and sustainability with aesthetics, arts and culture, with the aim of driving social inclusion and accessibility, as well as strengthening the contribution of culture to sustainability.
Examine cultural transformations driving sustainability and explore new cooperation paths among relevant stakeholders, including cultural and creative industries[2], interested in designing a new European way of life in line with the New European Bauhaus.[3]
Scope:
The New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative was launched in the autumn 2020 by European Commission President von der Leyen to bring the European Green Deal to life in an attractive, innovative and human-centred way. It is a new cultural project for Europe to lead a whole systemic change with its own aesthetics, sustainability and inclusiveness. This is why it will become a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers, designers, cultural and heritage professionals, and other population groups of society, such as for example persons with disabilities, children, young and older persons, will work together to translate the Green Deal objectives into tangible applications, inclusive and accessible experiences for citizens and stakeholders.
This should be achieved by combining the three dimensions of sustainability, quality (of life, of human experiences, of architecture[4]) and social inclusion. The NEB is essentially a project that aims to be a bridge between the world of science and technology and the world of art and culture, where citizens shall need to take ownership of the Green Deal. Its potential will depend on its capacity to leverage the power of creativity and innovation by architects, designers and artists in contemporary societies to shape a better way of living in line with the principles of environmental, social, cultural and economic sustainability, paving the way to inclusion, participation and to the creation of more resilient communities.
Multidisciplinary research and innovation involving relevant professionals, as well as citizen and stakeholder engagement, are key factors for the success of the New European Bauhaus initiative, and should characterise proposals under this topic. The NEB is an initiative focused on achieving societal impact, therefore proposals should critically reflect on and elaborate practical solutions to apply its principles to the built environment, public spaces, such as green spaces and living environments that provide space and opportunities for recovery and social contacts, and cultural-artistic practices, across the many different socio-economic and cultural settings in Europe. The role of quality architecture, as exemplified by the Architecture Guide to SDGs[5], should be considered by focusing on inclusive architecture and design, as a means to embrace human diversity and ensure accessibility and safety for all.
NEB solutions should help to increase recognition and visibility of European artists and creators underpinning emerging talent from Creative Europe platforms.
Proposals should show how they will contribute to developing new applications and new knowledge about the design of a public and private sustainable, inclusive, functional, accessible, aesthetically attractive and resilient built environment. The interconnection between virtual and physical spaces should be taken into consideration, including with a view to the emerging concept of “hybrid environment”.
Research could for example deal with heritage sites and cultural landscapes, aiming to protect and enhance their values in order to improve the well-being and sense of belonging of users/residents, the accessibility for persons with specific fragilities as well as experimenting CCIs-driven innovation in living spaces.
The proposed solutions should be socially, culturally, economically and politically feasible across Europe. Their feasibility should be verified in these terms in at least three different settings and in at least three different Member States/Associated Countries. Practical policy recommendations and guidance based on the findings should be produced for European, national, regional and local authorities.
A balanced overall coverage of EU Member States/Associated Countries should be sought. Citizens and stakeholders should be involved from an early stage. Links should be envisaged with relevant European programmes and initiatives, in particular Horizon Europe, the New European Bauhaus, the European Green Deal and the UNESCO Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape [6].

Projects should contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes:
Enhance cooperation at the European level between key actors and stakeholders within endangered languages communities.
Empower local communities and promote citizens’ engagement in the sustainable management of their own linguistic resources, in line with the principles of the Faro Convention.
Suggest strategies to involve young people in the (re)discovery of their linguistic heritage and its importance for the development of their identity and community building.
Promote equality and linguistic diversity in line with the EU’s motto ‘United in Diversity’ and its work to reinforce the central role of multilingualism in Europe.
Strengthen the identification, inventory and transmission of regional, minority and local languages as vehicles of oral expressions and traditions, in line with the principles of the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.
Scope:
Languages, whether they are internationally used by millions of people or spoken by only small and remote communities, are the expression of the identity, culture and the way communities and peoples perceive their world. They are an essential part of the rich fabric of European culture. When languages disappear, our cultural diversity is impoverished. While this risk has been recognised internationally (including by UNESCO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, etc.), many of the regional, minority and local languages, which are spoken today in the European Union, Associated and Neighbourhood Countries, are in danger of disappearing.
Starting from the analysis of the sociolinguistic, legal and economic situation of European endangered languages, of the reasons behind their endangered status, as well as of past and present policies, the action should propose ways to promote the reawakening of these endangered languages. This implies encouraging and supporting their use as well as their intergenerational transmission. The project should explore measures in different areas such as the educational, cultural and creative sectors, and link them with regional development. The use of digital tools is strongly encouraged, as it is the easiest channel to reach and involve society, and in particular young people, in the (re)discovery of their own linguistic heritage, including non-written languages.
The creation of a European language preservation ecosystem is at the heart of this topic, in particular with the establishment of a set of guidelines for revitalizing endangered languages in Europe and the setting up of a comprehensive website. This also aims at exchanging best practices and collecting endangered language resources and tools that, with the appropriate involvement of stakeholders concerned, should be made widely available. A set of identified guidelines should be validated by the use of existing cases of language revitalization. Available results of research already undertaken on language revitalisation should be taken into consideration, while identification of needs for further research in the field should be promoted. Examples of grass root movements that foster the engagement of local communities and, in particular, of young people, to learn and use such languages should be analysed and their motivating factors examined. These good practices should be taken into account when developing methodologies, in order to enhance them and to make them adaptable to local situations. Participation of regional or local communities and/or administrations, civil society, universities and other research institutions, networks and platforms working on multilingualism as well as on the promotion of regional and minority languages are encouraged and will ensure efficient and comprehensive bottom-up solutions.

Revive, valorise and foster traditional crafts techniques and combine them with new and emerging cutting-edge technologies.
Bring together the traditional know-how with new and/or digital technologies to develop improved and new products, services and professions.
Set up platforms and develop methodologies, curricula, entrepreneurship skills and courses for vocational training, to create jobs and revive enterprises where tradition meets the future.
Create sustainable relationships and networks between research and heritage sites, cultural and creative sectors, institutions, universities and other research institutions, regional and national authorities, enterprises and other relevant stakeholders, in order to promote innovation, jobs and sustainable growth.
Scope:
Traditional artefacts and the old crafts techniques are a significant part of our cultural heritage and arts. They showcase the interpenetrating relationship between material culture and human beings producing or consuming it. Artefacts and traditional objects are cultural products as they store social, personal and cultural memory and knowledge, and they enable the articulation of self-identity in symbolic ways. The transmission and reproduction of traditional know-how is the “conditio sine qua non” for the safeguarding and valorising of these cultural products. Still, they need strong interaction with creation in order to strengthen their impact and attractiveness in society.
The goals of the manufacturing and crafts sector have changed over time. This puts at risk traditional crafts techniques, which are in danger of disappearing, and with them important knowledge and know-how of ancient techniques and materials to produce and restore historic artefacts.
Combining old crafts techniques with cutting-edge new technologies opens up new dimensions and opportunities for the preservation and restoration of cultural goods, as well as for new and high quality products and services on the market. For instance, it has been the case with the cooperation of the traditional north Italian fabrics manufacturing and the European high-end fashion industry.
Proposals under this topic should address these challenges by understanding the techniques of traditional artefacts encompassing the full range of materials (stone, ceramic, porcelain, metal, wood, fabric, paper/papyrus, etc.). R&I actions should aim at reproducing traditional artefacts, traditional techniques and know-how by combining them with new, digital and other cutting-edge technologies. R&I initiatives should identify new areas of application and markets for professions combining traditional crafts with cutting-edge technologies. They should develop methodologies to combine these two approaches while bringing together all stakeholders concerned to set up clusters covering proposals for professional training and platforms connecting, among others, researchers, craftspeople, enterprises and business innovators, in order to bring new products and services on the market. Actions should include proposals for curricula to train in these new technologies, combining traditional skills with new technologies and entrepreneurship to succeed on the market, including specific business plans. The participation of enterprises, SMEs and CCIs is strongly encouraged to ensure appropriate and economically sustainable use of the new products.

Produce evidence-based research to support the deployment of preventative measures against looting and illicit trade of cultural goods.
Raise awareness, mobilize and further strengthen cooperation among citizens, stakeholders, experts, policy makers and all actors involved.
Scope:
Cultural goods and artefacts are put at risk through a number of man-made actions. The underfinancing and neglecting of heritage sites, as well as looting, smuggling and illicit trade of cultural goods, are major dangers threatening to destroy our cultural heritage. In particular, illicit trafficking of cultural goods – although not being a new phenomenon – has expanded dramatically in recent years, especially in areas affected by armed conflicts and natural disasters. The destruction, theft, looting or smuggling of cultural goods could stem from lack of awareness, but is mostly motivated by the pursuit of profit. Very often, it is also linked to a certain ideology that aims to destroy collective memory and dismember people’s identity. Moreover, the illicit trafficking of cultural property contributes to the funding of terrorism, organised crime and money laundering. Regulations and legal instruments are put in place to criminalize the offences and penalize the offenders, but research is needed at the level of prevention to protect cultural artefacts from falling victims of theft, smuggling or illicit trade.
To address these challenges, proposals under this topic should explore preventive actions such as methods or technologies/materials of non-destructive marking and digital detection of cultural goods with respect to material and nature of artefacts and ways to identify cultural objects. The proposed technologies should be sustainable and detectable, preferably without heavy or expensive equipment[1]. Building on existing research achievements, networks and cooperation facilities, projects should contribute to provenance research of cultural heritage, as well as to further awareness raising and mobilizing the actors involved, such as art dealers, auction houses, policy makers, law enforcement agents, stakeholders or citizens. Proposals are encouraged to include interdisciplinary cooperation with local, regional and national authorities, as well as cultural and creative stakeholders to attract and engage the public, in particular young people. International cooperation is encouraged as appropriate.

Contribute to safeguarding and protecting Europe’s cultural heritage from the effects of climate change and natural hazards, including rural and remote areas, coastal and maritime cultural landscapes and underwater heritage.
Explore innovative and sustainable ways to protect cultural heritage and cultural landscapes from climate change, disaster risks and pollutants.
Scope:
Climate change, through consequences such as global warming, rising sea levels, extended dry seasons or floods and heavy storms, is threatening our built heritage and affecting our cultural landscapes. Acid rain and environmental pollution erode and deface monuments and historical buildings. Accelerated soil erosion threatens buried archaeological heritage, while rising sea levels threaten to cover entire cities under water. Solutions provided by research to this day are not exhaustive and could not always anticipate the worsening or newly emerging effects of continuous climate change. Thus, there is a pressing need to explore and test innovative ways to protect monuments, historical buildings and sites from the effects of climate change and natural hazards.
Proposals under this topic should explore innovative and sustainable ways to protect monuments, historical buildings, archaeological sites and cultural landscapes from climate change effects[1], natural hazards and environmental pollution, taking into consideration their environmental footprint[2] as well as users’ comfort. Importance should also be given to coastal and maritime regions and underwater heritage, addressing, in particular, the need for research on wetting phenomena and repellence. Proposals can consider cooperation with European Neighbourhood countries as appropriate for achieving their objectives and increasing impact.

Projects should contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
Better awareness and understanding of European arts, culture and values[1] within the EU and internationally by leveraging the creativity of arts and cultural heritage partners in Europe.
Wider exposure to the diversity of European art, culture and values for European and international partners, by strengthening links with creative industries and other parts of the economy.
Reinforced common European action to promote Europe’s culture and economic interests internationally, hence contributing to strengthen European competitiveness.
Scope:
European arts and cultural heritage have an intrinsic value in enriching our lives, but also reflect our way of life, and contribute to shaping our society and its values. They are important elements of our creativity and innovation, on which we build economic growth and social development. They also have a role in shaping the way Europe is perceived from afar, thus being important assets for our “soft power” and for promoting Europe’s place in the world. If Europe wants to maintain its place in a globalised world, it is in our interest to step up common efforts to promote Europe’s culture, values and interests.
However, we are not necessarily aware of, or appreciate, the diversity of European arts and cultural heritage and its important role in democratic society. The challenge of research is to contribute knowledge as well as to identify ways of reinforcing common European action for the benefit or our society.
New and creative approaches may be required to broaden its attractiveness and reach – e.g. contemporary art forms, design, modern technology and media. Similarly, exposing international audiences more widely to European art, culture and values could raise interest, recognition and potentially lead to increased competitiveness. Cooperation with cultural and creative stakeholders, e.g. artists, actors and designers is encouraged to attract and engage the public and in particular young people.
Europe is in global competition for markets and investments, where industrial and service competitors use every available tool including cultural policy and cultural diplomacy in their international promotion efforts. European research, in cooperation with cultural and creative sectors and a wide range of stakeholders, should contribute new knowledge as well as identifying ways of reinforcing common European action to promote Europe’ s culture, values and interests for the benefit of our societies and prosperity. Digital solutions and cutting-edge technologies should be considered. In order to draw lessons for policy, it is important to assess the actions of competitors, while evaluating the effectiveness of the common European action and its potential. Research should contribute to identifying ways of more effectively promoting common European interests at a global level, leveraging resources and forging closer cooperation between cultural, creative and economic partners.

Improved knowledge of legal and intellectual property rights issues linked to the gaming population and games industry in the international markets.
Proposals for improving games in terms of positive impact on education, skillsets, responsible business models, employment chances, social cohesion and creativity.
Scope:
Games are fast growing, fast changing parts of industry known for their advanced role in ICT. Yet, although millions of Europeans play these games, the impact of games on European culture and society, as well as on its cohesion and values has not been thoroughly researched.
Research should address these gaps in knowledge, which include possible differences between age groups, gender and socioeconomic backgrounds, the current situation in game literacy or the digital divide. Games are a form of culture where new communication and languages, as well as new artistic expressions, are being developed in particular by younger generations. However, there is limited knowledge about the potential benefits and shortcomings of games in terms of learning and creativity. In today’s ever-expanding market, games and emerging forms of play are involved in many aspects of our societies. However, research has neither sufficiently addressed the cultural value, impact, innovation potential, nor the possible risks for individuals and society that games can present. Proposals should address the risks brought by the digital game world on phenomena such as social exclusion, intolerance and harassment, with a view to possible policy options and actions.
Proposals should address the role of games in culture and in shaping European societies, their cohesion and values, with the objective of developing new knowledge and evidence for policymaking. Proposals should address legal and IPR issues linked to the gaming population and its creative work. Relevant stakeholders, including CCIs, other creatives, non-commercial interests and policy makers, should be involved to ensure the research and results respond well to the needs. This new knowledge and evidence should provide input for policymaking and for improved practices.

Projects should contribute to at least two the following expected outcomes:
Provide new/improved methodologies for capturing the economic and societal value of music.
Develop indicators to better detect the performance of the European music sector and its contribution to economic and social development, as well as to sustainability. Promote standardised data collection about the music (sub-)sector(s) to measure the contribution of the EU music sector to the whole economy, the number of employed in the EU music sector, and music consumption on live, broadcast and digital platforms.
Increase the transparency of the music industry, in particular the online/streaming business, through better data provision. Provide an estimation of the impact of music participation to the society.
Provide policymakers with effective tools for measuring and enhancing the impact of EU policy making, in the context of Music Moves Europe and beyond, on the music sector.
Scope:
Music has an important economic value, but also a fundamental societal impact, contributing to social development and wellbeing. This is particularly relevant in the case of big economic and social crisis, such as the recent one provoked by COVID-19. Of all the cultural and creative sectors, music has also been the one hit the most from the digital revolution, the reduction of physical sales and the concentration of digital distribution in few big players. The sector is currently bearing dramatic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, the music sector is subject to the fast-evolving consumer behaviours related to cultural content consumption and live performances.
At EU level, support for the music sector comes under the Music Moves Europe initiative (MME)[1]along different strands (programme funding, policy cooperation, regulatory measures, dialogue). The lack of reliable and comparable data to develop a competitive, fair and sustainable European music ecosystem is an underlying issue. Therefore, proposals should assess and develop appropriate methodologies and perform quantitative, qualitative and statistical analyses at national and EU level to estimate the economic and the societal impact of the music sector.
Proposals should aim at improving statistical data and methods for capturing the economic impact of the music sector. In estimating the economic value of the sector, proposals should also elaborate on lacking definitions related to national and European repertoire and on methodologies allowing to include, on one side, the many professionals being micro enterprises (and therefore completely excluded from official statistics) and, on the other, big digital platforms, making music available for free via adds or selling of data, that are also not reflected in official European statistics. The results of this research should also show the impact of COVID-19 on the music sector, both live and online. In addition, proposals should further research on the economy of the streaming models: while streaming (for free or via a subscription) services are becoming a main access point for music and are expected to grow even further in the years to come, their economic impact on the whole sector in the long term, in particular on the creators, is still uncertain. Proposals should also include in their analysis the impact of COVID-19 on music consumption through streaming platforms. In particular, they should assess whether the catastrophic economic impact of cancelling live music events has translated into a parallel increase in music consumption and revenues for creators and the music sector as a whole. Proposals should also estimate the economic impact on the music sector of the evolution and future trends of social media platforms and new social media channels, as well as streaming of live music events and new forms of “home-made creation” production. Proposals should assess and develop appropriate methodologies to estimate the societal impact of music. They should map the various forms of music participation: playing, performing, creating and consuming music, and their impact as a source of wellbeing across population segments. Based on innovative approaches and a representative geographic coverage across Europe, proposals should also explain how people engage with music in the age of social media, internet and television across different socio-economic groups.

While research has tackled various aspects of this topic, it is however necessary to further undertake an in-depth investigation of the role of these factors in and their impact on the European integration process.
Proposals under this topic will identify and examine the factors that influence and change people’s perceptions of the European project over time, under different geographical, political or socio-economic circumstances. Changes may also affect how people’s perceptions are expressed and become visible in different media (e.g. social media, language). Research should also address the role of values and socio-political behaviour in perceiving and dealing with emergencies and economic crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Lessons learnt during the COVID-19 crisis and the recovery period could be used to provide policy scenarios for facing future crises and building resilient and sustainable post-crisis societies. Finally, proposals should investigate the role of perceptions in understanding and interacting with politics and political legitimacy in the EU. They should provide recommendations on how to address these different perceptions in the policy shaping and implementation of the EU integration process.

Outcomes and deliverables
First deployed QKD experimental networks integrated and operating with existing communication networks in several Member States and addressing different advanced use cases, stimulating the emergence of a fully-fledged and technologically autonomous European quantum communication industry and contributing to preparations for the full deployment of the EuroQCI;
A large number of trained users in quantum communication technologies and Member States ready for the design and deployment of next generation highly secure communication and data networks.
Objective:
The objective of this topic is twofold. On one hand to deploy advanced national quantum systems and networks for testing quantum communication technologies and for integrating them with existing communication networks. On the other hand to use these quantum systems and networks for developing and testing use cases in support of national QCI initiatives in the context of the EuroQCI initiative. This support is needed to contribute to European technological autonomy in the highly strategic field of quantum communication technologies.
Scope:
In each participating Member State, the project should include the following activities:
Deploying advanced experimental quantum systems and networks combining the best of quantum and classical security technologies. Where possible, using pilot devices, technologies and systems developed and manufactured in the EU, in order to support their further development towards maturity and their compliance with the EuroQCI’s security needs. Making these systems and networks widely available for undertaking and testing (in a number of real use cases) the functioning and the provision of very high security QKD components and systems, their interoperability and the end-to-end secure functioning of the system architecture.
The aim is to prepare the large-scale uptake and use of such systems and technologies, operating in traditional telecommunications networks (including, where relevant, existing TESTA infrastructure) by national stakeholders and their first use in advanced use cases in different application scenarios:
- targeting firstly public use cases by linking public authorities within the country;
- making these quantum networks available to industries operating the network’s different layers contributing to developing national-based production chains for supplying critical quantum communication components and systems. This includes the integration of quantum and traditional cybersecurity systems in communication systems and networks (possibly also supported by post-quantum algorithms), which will be used to prepare for the future large-scale deployment of EuroQCI;
- making these quantum systems and networks available for educational purposes providing a training environment for technical and research staff as well as national users from public authorities or other organisations.
Demonstrating first long-distance quantum communication networks (including, for example, quantum internet demonstrators) compatible with the overall EuroQCI system architecture, in order to prepare the large-scale deployment of a QCI spanning the EU;
Where relevant, testing the interface between the EuroQCI’s space and terrestrial systems.
Cooperating and participating with other Member States in the deployment plan and strategic efforts towards designing and building an overall EuroQCI system architecture, including by exchanging lessons learned and experiences in building robust and fully secure QKD systems and networks.

Mature QKD-based systems ready for integration and deployment in an operational telecom infrastructure, over short and long distances;
First fully functional telecom network systems managing quantum keys and assuring the interoperability between quantum and traditional cybersecurity systems, that ensure the secrecy and integrity of sensitive digital data in Europe;
Objective:
To prepare for the industrialisation and deployment of quantum communication infrastructure (QCI) technological and operational capabilities and advanced QCI networks essential for European cybersecurity, and contribute to the development of a European industrial QCI ecosystem, including a thriving SME sector. This support is needed to contribute to European technological autonomy in the highly strategic field of quantum communication technologies.
Scope:
The action will focus on the following two priorities:
* Industrialisation of EU QKD devices, technologies and systems: prepare for industrialisation and for deployment (i.e. reaching TRL 8-9) quantum technology components for quantum key distribution that are stable, miniaturised and have competitive performance (e.g. cost-effective, exhibiting higher key exchange rates, link distances) that can be demonstrated over both short and long distances. QKD systems should enable scalability to multi-user network architectures and upgradability to future quantum information networks. Examples of such core technology components include quantum random number generators, photon sources, application and control software, etc. Work should also cover the integration of individual components and devices to larger, standalone QKD systems and their full testing and thus compliance to EU (ETSI/CENELEC) standards (including independent device protocols) and to EAL level 4 or above (Evaluation Assurance Level of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (ISO/IEC 15408)), in view of their potential deployment in the EuroQCI initiative. Work should also include an exploitation plan covering all the industrialisation and fabrication aspects of such devices, technologies, systems and processes underpinning the creation of an EU QKD supply chain.
* QKD-based Telecom Network System production: Develop the full run system integration from EU QKD system (level 1) to Telecom network systems (level 2), key management (level 3) until cyber security system level (level 4). The level 4 quantum cybersecurity systems will then be integrated in traditional communication networks, assuring interoperability in a full multi-user end-to-end architecture. Upgradability to quantum information networks should be considered. Work should also cover the testing and certification/standards compliance of the complete QKD-based Telecom System in view of its deployment in the EuroQCI initiative.
Individual proposals should cover at least one of the above priorities. The final proposals selection for EU funding will ensure appropriate coverage of both priorities. At least 60% of the budget will be allocated to proposals addressing the first priority.

POLICY CONTEXT
Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) play a major role among others in providing aid atUnion, national and local levels. In the field of health, and specially public health, they provide services directly to patients and individuals being in some cases in the first line of action also during emergencies. NGOs are also essential in bridging the gap between institutions and patients and facilitating communication at national and Union level. These organisations are not-for-profit and therefore necessarily rely on funding from different sources, for instance private donations, national or international contributions.
The Commission considers it important that there is continuity in the work carried out by the health NGOs in addressing current health challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, and it intends to award operating grants under this work programme to eligible NGOs.

NGOs’ expertise and contribution is expected to be of added value in relation to NCDs, health determinants, ageing society, vulnerable groups and rare diseases. Poor nutrition, physical inactivity, obesity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol are risk factors common to other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases may also require attention.
The demographic changes, in particular the ageing of society, challenge the sustainability of health systems and disorders, such as dementia, and age-related diseases and disabilities may need to be addressed. Patients and health systems need to have access to sustainable, efficient, equitable, and affordable high-quality medicinal products, including in the cross-border context, to fully benefit from those medicinal products on the basis of transparent, consistent, and patient-oriented medical information.
The views of the patients with complex or rare diseases and conditions that require highly specialised treatment, and concentrated knowledge and resources, need to be heard and their access to diagnosis and high-quality healthcare improved. Furthermore, there is a need to protect people in vulnerable situations, including those suffering from mental illness and those living with or most affected by communicable or non-communicable diseases and chronic diseases, and to promote activities, which address and prevent the collateral impact of health crises on people belonging to such vulnerable groups and actions that improve mental health.

The operating grants linked to a specified time-frame and specific outputs or results are intended to provide support to health NGOs that pursue one or more of the specific objectives of Article 4 points (a) to (j) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522. By analogy to grants without a call for proposals, the award of operating grants with an open call for proposals is subject to compliance with the conditions of Article 13(1)-(4) and (8) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522, and the relevant criteria set in the Financial Regulation, as well as additional criteria set out in the call for proposals.

The Hop On Facility is based on Article 20 (3) of the HE Common Understanding providing that the work programme may foresee the possibility for legal entities from low R&I performing countries to join already selected collaborative R&I actions, subject to the agreement of the respective consortium and provided that legal entities from such countries are not yet participating in it. The scheme further aims at achieving the Inclusiveness ambition of the future ERA policy by involving research institutions from widening countries under Horizon Europe Pillar 2 actions.
Main selection criteria are excellence and added value of the new partner performing a relevant additional task in the project. All consortium partners need to agree on the accession of the new partner whereas the R&I relevance and complementarity needs to be demonstrated. The accepted application will trigger a GA amendment with the service in charge of the related topic.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
At system level, it mobilises excellence in the Widening countries, increases visibility of the participants from the Widening countries, improves knowledge circulation, and reduces lack of participation of the Widening countries in specific thematic domains.
At organisation level, it opens up silos of established closed consortia, improves research excellence of the Widening country’s institutions in specific fields, enlarges outreach of the participants’ R&I actions and provides access to new talent pools.
At the level of the beneficiary, new competencies and skills for working in transnational projects including research management and dissemination and exploitation are acquired.
Scope:
The Hop On Facility integrates one additional participant from a Widening country to an ongoing project under Pillar 2 or the EIC pathfinder scheme while topping up a relevant task or work package and the cost incurred by the additional participant. This will happen on a voluntary basis without affecting the freedom of choice for the consortium and the principle of excellence.

*Establishment of an up-to-date catalogue of suitable solutions for a wide variety of ship types and operation scenarios.
Scope:
Progress towards climate neutrality of waterborne transport can be achieved more quickly by means of retrofit solutions that improve the performance of the existing fleet (sea-going and IWT) whilst solutions which are exclusive to new ships can only be implemented at the pace of the commercially driven fleet renewal.
In the trajectory towards the transition to new technologies that will make waterborne transport and operation greener and climate neutral picking the low hanging fruits is important. With the comparatively long life cycles of waterborne assets and their high initial capital costs addressing the existing fleet is paramount in order to achieve fast and tangible results. Therefore, interventions that are easily implemented by shipyards, ship owners and operators need to be developed in the shortest possible time to reduce emissions from vessels already in service, both seagoing and those operating in inland navigation. The latter are particularly relevant as they tend to be in use in excess of 30 years and are largely owned by SMEs with limited investment potential.
In this context the owner-operator dilemma poses additional problem in the waterborne sector: A large number of ships are bareboat chartered by an operator who does not take investment decisions although he could benefit from them through lower running costs. The owner who would have to make those investment decisions, however, does not gain financial advantages as charter rates are generally fixed and depend on ship size and speed only. A performance related charter rate system has often been discussed but rarely implemented. Easy and relatively cheap retrofitting solutions may help in overcoming this dilemma.
For inland navigation and/or maritime shipping projects are expected to address one or more of the following:
Retrofit solutions to significantly reduce air or water pollution without increasing fuel consumption and hence GHG emissions, for example main engine abatement systems or engine and propulsion system modifications.
Retrofit solutions which significant reduce GHG emissions through partial or full electrification, clearly progressing beyond the state of the art. Indicative examples are battery ICE hybridisation for the main propulsion system and auxiliary power, electric network reconfiguration, electrical power management.
Retrofit innovative hydrodynamic improvements (hull, hull management, appendages) to significantly improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions by reducing fuel consumption.
Projects will focus on the design for technically and economically efficient retrofitting of the ship along these main lines. Cost efficiency of the proposed solutions will come from standardised and modular solutions applicable to different ships or by significantly reducing operational costs over the expected remaining life time of the asset. This may require new business models and implementation strategies based on a catalogue of solutions including smart maintenance. Attention will be paid to solutions which are not causing secondary emissions to air or water and which will not significantly increase fuel consumption.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Achieve a competitive advantage for European shipbuilders within global markets, particularly for complex high added value vessels.
Rapid early ship design (including an AI-based analysis of technical and legal requirements derived from historic data or from a structured feedback loop between builder and operator), underpinning the functional design concept and production cost estimations.
Virtual prototyping to increase the reliability of early stage capital cost estimations, particularly taking into account the full range of greening options and innovative (and potentially difficult to cost) technologies such as green power systems (batteries, fuels etc.), the impacts on weight and revenue generating spaces as well as benefits towards operational cost.
Provide benefits towards the competitiveness of the wider European shipbuilding sector, beyond single shipyards, through the creation of a fast, flexible and reliable design environment and platform that also includes repair yards. The platform is expected to be based on Industry 4.0 digital technologies and is expected to be fully tested through a dedicated design case as a demonstrator. This should include all relevant design disciplines and focus specifically on the full range of technologies supporting the reduction of emissions, with linkage to highly automated and robotised processes in parts manufacturing, assembly and outfitting with full supply chain integration.
Integration of the ship design stages (conceptual, functional, production), considering also supply chain management issues. Demonstration of a future proof ship design concept based on modular architectures that allow for (cost) efficient retrofitting during the ship’s life cycle.
Computational shipbuilding tools and data management systems which are resilient to cyber threats.
A European workforce that is highly skilled in the deployment and use of advanced computational tools in shipbuilding, particularly with respect to the integration of new technologies.
Scope:
Advanced computational systems are essential to Europe’s competitive advantage in the construction, maintenance, conversion and repair of the world’s most complex, high added value ships. Present computational systems are often proprietary, increasingly outdated and difficult to maintain whilst Europe’s competitors are continuing to develop their advanced computational capacity. It is essential that Europe is able to maintain and extend its competitive lead within the high technology shipbuilding segment and that advanced computational tools are developed which in particular are able to integrate a wide range of emerging innovative technologies within designs, such as alternative power systems based on e.g. e-fuels, renewables, electrification, and hybridisation. Systems need to feed into competitive production processes as well as support potential changes to a ship design during its entire life-cycle.
The complexity of such tools and systems calls for novel solutions regarding design and production platforms, infrastructures, and services which may not be within reach of smaller European shipyards and design consultancies. Therefore, new concepts for a reliable and cost efficient roll-out of advanced platforms and tools are expected to be developed and demonstrated.
Furthermore developments should benefit the wider European shipbuilding sector and address the necessary skills development to enable full exploitation of the advanced computation tools.
Proposals should develop advanced innovative computational tools for shipbuilding that increase the European sectors competitiveness by addressing all of the following points:
Facilitate rapid early stage design to support lower risk bid development particularly when integrating innovative new technologies.
Provide better capital cost estimations and performance predictions, particularly showing the improvements expected from the inclusion of new technologies.
Tools to be integrated with ship construction and production, as well as considering supply chain management and future maintenance and repair of vessels.
Address and quantify the competitiveness gains provided by the tool(s) in the context of the wider European shipbuilding sector.
Ensure that the tool is robust and resilient against cyber threats.
Identify and address the necessary skills development needed to achieve the maximum benefit from innovative advanced computational shipbuilding tools.
Develop a business case to quantify the added value from the developed tool to the shipbuilder concerned and within the context of the wider European shipbuilding sector.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Achieve better understanding of (semi)volatiles particles and secondary aerosol formation as well as their effects on health, air quality (in particular during winter season) and climate.
Assess the contribution to PM2.5 of precursors present in exhaust from transport (i.e. volatile organic compounds, NOx, unburned hydrocarbons, nano-particles below 23nm, ammonia, etc.) through the formation of secondary aerosol (organic –SOA- and inorganic).
Find ways in which scientific evidences of the role of emissions in atmospheric processes could be an input to develop policies and mitigate SOA formation in urban areas of EU.
Improved quantification of transport externalities.
Support of future emissions legislation and of “polluter pays” legislation.
Scope:
The impact of transport emissions on air quality and health is relatively well known as far as direct pollutants emission are concerned, i.e. particulate, NOx, hydrocarbons etc. However, some of the emissions from engines and combustion processes in general are also leading to further formation of health impacting compounds due to atmospheric aerosol chemistry, and the specific impact of these compounds is less understood (except for ozone, whose chemistry has been widely studied for other reasons). Also, in fields where regulation limits particles emissions (cars, trucks, aircraft, non-road mobile machinery) current engine particles emissions count only assesses the number of solid particles, disregarding the so-called volatile and semi-volatile particles, thus underestimating the impact on air quality and health.
Proposals should assess in detail engines emissions in Real Driving Emissions (RDE)-compliant testing conditions (based on currently used fuels) leading to volatile and semi-volatile and secondary particulate, taking into account the wide available literature and results from projects issuing from topics LC-MG-1-1-2018 and GV-02-2016, prioritise them according to available information and assess their health impact with relevant modelling and in vitro and in vivo testing.
After assessing the risks associated to each emission, proposals should define a robust and transparent measurement and modelling system in order to determine an equivalent total particles emissions index for each engine encompassing all these emissions, to complement the direct solid particles emissions count currently in use to better quantify the total externalities of combustion engines in all transport fields and related fuels.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.

Demonstration of the developed concepts over a period of at least 6 months in real world conditions involving manufacturer(s), energy provider(s), electric and hydrogen infrastructure and end users (e.g. carriers, logistics service providers and cargo owners) from across Europe, covering at least 500 km (for long haul) average daily operation in real conditions – in line with drive and resting time regulation.
Provide fleet managers with ZEV-specific, flexible, managerial tools (e.g. adapted to the characteristics of vehicles and infrastructure) supporting the seamless integration of zero tailpipe emissions vehicles into fleets and facilitating the assignment of tasks and routes (infrastructure, range, charging time, payload etc.).
Contribute to significant price reduction steps by targeting and showing a pathway towards total cost of operation equality with 2020 engine-based solutions assuming a production volume of >= 10.000 pieces/year, and net TCO reductions beyond that.
Scope:
The call is asking for a modular and flexible powertrain approach for large heavy-duty trucks which can serve varying mission demands (range, power and re-charging/-fuelling requirements) by varying battery/tank sizes to serve different missions and driving profiles within one vehicle platform.
Flexible vehicle platforms can allow the installation of modular powertrain solutions including either pure BEV/FCEV versions or hydrogen FC range extended battery vehicles, exploiting the scalability and modularity of the installed power units to allow cost efficient solutions for dedicated missions.
At least two different prototypes need to be demonstrated covering two different missions under operational conditions: one of which is mandatorily for long haul freight transport, as defined in expected outcomes, while the additional prototype(s) is/are open to Vehicle Group 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 or 12 of VECTO capable of operating at maximum gross vehicle weight (GVW) of minimum 40 tons under operational conditions comparable to the VECTO regional mission profile, and/or long distance coach(es).
Applicants should go beyond activities carried out by actions funded under topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-DEST5-CCT-01-01, avoiding duplication of activities already performed under this topic, as well as of activities developed by ongoing Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking projects[1].
Proposals are expected to address the following:
Efficient energy/thermal management including the HVAC system and during ultra-fast charging both while driving and during breaks (including auxiliaries like overnight hotel and, optionally, refrigeration loads) achieving a minimum 44% energy efficiency in FC “charge sustaining mode” or 82% for BEV configurations (both at “tank-to-wheel” on the VECTO Regional Distribution and Long Haul cycles as appropriate).
For FC applications, the scalable power level of a hydrogen-based power unit for full power operation or range extension to vary power and range demands of different mission profiles is expected to demonstrate at least 90% availability and 30.000 hr FC operational life for safe and efficient operations, including scale-up options; (FC and tank development are excluded from this topic; suitable engagement with FCH projects needs to be foreseen).
For BEV long haul applications, demonstration of fast charging concepts, capable of fitting established regulations and business practices, with a range recovery of at least 400 km in 45 min, with an overall charge efficiency of at least 80%. The proposed solutions are expected to not reduce transport productivity (i.e. km per day, including driver resting time) and should be deployable at load/unload points and staging areas, while ensuring grid compatibility.
Demonstration of a delivery load capacity not less than 90% of a current such vehicle.
Improvement of inverter and DC/DC technologies integration in regard to optimized and novel cooling concepts and cost reduction, considering where appropriate synergies with HORIZON-CL5-2021-DEST5-CCT-01-02.

Predictive maintenance strategies considering AI technologies, including deployment of prognostic and diagnostic techniques and control units in order to improve the lifetime of the fuel cells systems.
Show the minimum achievable impact on environment (GHG, polluting emissions, biodiversity, resources etc.) using a comparative life-cycle assessment.
Projects should deliver digital twin models of the demonstrator vehicles, such that the impact of the innovations towards the overall objectives of the 2Zero partnership might be determined prior to the completion of the project. Data that is produced as output from a ‘digital twin’ should be FAIR, deposition in relevant repositories should be encouraged[2].
Price reduction resulting from economies of scale due to modularity and standardization of components in other truck, bus/coach (and where possible railway) applications (also creating links with on-going projects in the FCH partnership) with a clear roadmap for how to increase production numbers after the end of the project and for developing the necessary value chains. System level cost-effectiveness of solutions (including needed infrastructure) need to be analysed.
Develop and validate tools for zero tailpipe emission vehicles integration in fleets (and mixed fleets) for efficient assignment of tasks (routes, charging strategies, assignments etc.).
Identify European cross-border corridors with lower barriers or higher benefits to start market operations, along with possible future initiatives within the Connecting Europe Facility context.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Contributions to at least two full scale on-board demonstrators for two different electrical energy storage solutions by 2027.
Improve efficiency and make waterborne transport climate neutral through the exploitation of new innovative electrical storage systems.
In the medium term, upscaling of proven solutions for a broad range of ship types (e.g. IWT, ferries, short sea shipping) and operational scenarios, as an alternative to batteries.
Ensuring European leadership for energy storage solutions based on different technologies that will be fit-for-purpose for diverse waterborne applications.
*Achieve a comprehensive understanding of potential innovative energy storage systems other than batteries and their applicability to waterborne transport.
*Solutions to improve energy efficiency and make waterborne transport climate neutral founded upon innovative energy storage.
*Comprehensive assessment of the technical feasibility and adequacy of innovative energy storage for a range of waterborne operations including efficiency, safety, cost competitiveness compared to batteries, skills requirements, and regulatory aspects.
Scope:
Battery based electric energy storage systems are increasingly deployed within the waterborne sector, particularly for sea short shipping, complex high-end ships and inland navigation.
Nonetheless, specific operational requirements (e.g. autonomy, power peaks, etc.), in particular in adverse conditions outside sheltered waters or going upstream on rivers, remain a concern. Fully battery electric shipping is demanding, requiring very high energy levels to achieve a realistic operational range and the necessary speed and thrust performance, whilst hybrid applications can also be excessively large. Both hybrid and full battery operations are subject to many more charging cycles and longer lifetimes than other transport applications.
Batteries within most waterborne applications deployments are founded upon established battery technologies. However, other energy storage systems exist which maybe valuable for waterborne application in the future which have not been fully investigated. For example, super-/ultra-capacitors, superconductivity magnetic energy storage, flywheels, flow batteries, etc.
Projects will focus on low TRL solutions for waterborne transport, preliminary integration, safety studies and the potential combination with other disruptive technologies such as super conductors and the wider use of DC grids. It will address the integration on-board of innovative energy storage systems (excluding storage of fuels and conventional batteries), including control systems and optimised operational deployment, and the connection to the on-board electrical grid.
Projects will address the cost competitiveness of the innovative solutions when compared with batteries, specify the applicability in specific waterborne segments (in particular in IWT where electrification may be pioneered through a dedicated project), determine risk levels, identify safety measures and propose possible regulatory aspects. The pertinent skills development will be outlined.
Activities will address innovative energy storage for waterborne applications, it will not address the internal design of the energy storage technology itself. For example, the design of super capacitors would be excluded.

Explore synergies with land-based energy systems in Destination 3 and 4 of this Work Programme for the capture of these emissions and/or purification of air.
Deliver transformative technologies towards a silent aircraft operations around airports, including a study on airport noise map towards assessing the airports that would most benefit from noise reduction policies.
Advance further integrated and reference European models and methods for estimating aircraft emissions (LAQ and noise) inventories for operations in the airport vicinity, highly accurate estimations on the number of people affected. The models, methods and advancements in measurement technologies should advance further, contribute to and collaborate with existing ICAO CAEP and EUROCONTROL initiatives. They should also be aligned with H2020-ARTEM outcomes towards meeting the ACARE Flighpath2050 goals.
Scope:
LAQ and noise aviation emissions effect the quality of life and health. Air pollution is the number one environmental cause of premature death in the European Union. Despite progress in recent decades, it still causes more than 400,000 premature deaths every year, and it brings respiratory and cardiovascular diseases to millions.
While the aviation contribution is estimated to 0.4% of the total deaths attributed annually to global air quality degradation, aviation has a substantial impact on local air pollution around airport areas and efforts are ongoing to reduce it further. Aircraft noise remains a matter of concerns for airports and local authorities despite significant improvements, due to anticipated increase of total number of flights in Europe (could reach 12.8 million by 2035 – despite the present COVID-19 disruption).
Regarding the reduction of local air quality (LAQ) from NOx and particulate matter (PM), the selected technologies may consider sustainable drop-in and non-drop-in fuel options, aligned with EU industrial roadmaps and R&I activities in topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-05.
Regarding the reductions of aviation noise around airports, the selected technologies should consider propulsion and aircraft-propulsion integration interdependencies as well as operational air-traffic management procedures.
This topic aims to support the EU and ICAO LAQ and noise policies. This topic aims for new aircraft and engine technologies that satisfy the design and operational interdependencies between CO2, non-CO2 and noise emissions, are compatible with approved operational procedures and are aligned with the European industrial roadmaps for further development, validation and integration beyond 2030.

Advancing Lighthouse Exascale Applications, at the frontier of technology and relevant for the communities of HPC users, that enable and promote the use of upcoming exascale and post exascale computing capabilities in collaboration with other High Performance Computer (HPC) stakeholders. The goal is to develop or scale up existing parallel codes towards exascale performance, resulting into tangible benefits mainly for scientific challenges. Proposals for Exascale Lighthouse applications will exploit existing federated resources around Europe, developing available competences, and ensuring multidisciplinary (combining application domain and HPC system, software and algorithm expertise). Examples of Exascale Lighthouse applications include weather forecast and climate change, material science, natural hazards, digital twin of the human body.
Scope:
Proposals for Centres of Excellence in Topic HORIZON-JTI-EuroHPC-2021-COE-01-01 must clearly identify the Exascale Lighthouse applications addressed, and must convincingly demonstrate their exascale capabilities and needs. Proposals should also be able to articulate clearly the scientific grand challenge(s) which will be addressed by the applications and why the exascale performance is needed. Targeted applications should be relevant for communities of HPC users as well as for future EuroHPC JU systems to be acquired. Proposals should be inherently committed to co-design activities to ensure that future HPC architectures are well suited for the applications and their users.
Requirements for CoEs:
Clear identification of the targeted applications and related codes, including their user basis and the global impact in their domain.
Demonstrable advances of the targeted HPC applications towards highly scalable, optimised flagship codes and exascale performance (both computing and extreme data). This includes developing, maintaining, porting, optimising (if needed re-designing) and scaling HPC application codes, addressing the full scientific/industrial workflow, particularly covering data aspects; testing and validating codes and quality assurance
Addressing the exascale and post exascale related technical challenges, such as load balancing; resilience; heterogeneity programming models, in particular accelerator-based architecture programming; run-time systems; workflow management tools; development environments and production environments.
Involvement in co-design activities (hardware, software, codes), including the collaboration with HPC vendors and the identification of suitable applications relevant to the development of European HPC technologies towards exascale and collaboration with European initiatives (e.g. EPI, RISC- V, EuroHPC JU Pilots).
Activities to improve the energy efficiency of applications, algorithms, methods, libraries and/or tools.
Enlarging and expanding HPC applications development and use, in particular for new user communities in EU countries and countries associated to Horizon Europe that are members of the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking currently developing and advancing their HPC infrastructure and ecosystem.
Federating capabilities and integrating communities around exascale computing in Europe.
Include clear KPIs on the optimal employment of current and/or emerging HPC technologies, allowing the assessment of the progress towards the objectives, both in terms of outputs and ultimate impact.
Coordinate within the European ecosystem, including Competence Centres, to address the skills gap in the targeted exascale applications and codes, by specialised training and capacity building measures to develop the human capital resources for increased adoption of exascale solutions.
Coordinate with Competence Centres to ensure wider access to codes and foster their uptake by scientific user communities.
Proposals should ensure the cooperation with complementary projects launched specifically in the area of the “EuroHPC-2020-01-a: Advanced Pilots towards the European Supercomputers” including also the need to establish from the beginning of this cooperation appropriate IP exploitation agreements and should provide preliminary benchmarking data on new and emerging HPC technologies.
In addition, proposals should ensure collaboration with other Centres of Excellence for HPC applications, and other national and EU funded activities that focus on similar or complementary objectives for HPC codes and applications, in order to maximise the synergies and optimise such codes and applications for current and future architectures of EuroHPC supercomputers. Proposals should also clearly demonstrate that all partners in the consortium have a significant and justified role, including appropriate deliverables under their responsibility which cover their specific contributions.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Enable seamless safe logistics through an autonomous (or highly automated) waterborne freight feeder loop service for inland waterway and/or maritime transport applications. The autonomous system will provide an integrated, reliable, resilient, predicable fully automated service, also taking into account the interconnection of inland navigation and maritime transport in terms of serving the hinterland.
Provide increased legal and regulatory certainty concerning autonomous waterborne services within national maritime and/or inland waters, e.g. concerning COLREGs, national and inter-governmental legislation etc. Expansion to the international dimension where feasible.
Moving more freight by water with high levels of safety (taking in account all aspects related to fully autonomous navigation, e.g. manoeuvring, situational awareness, collision avoidance, failsafe operations), reduced environmental impact and contributions to climate neutrality, increased operational resilience and decongested land transport infrastructures.
Autonomous waterborne freight feeder services can be taken up by the market on basis of a sound business case. Development of new business models based on autonomous waterborne feeder services within national maritime and/or inland waters.
Reduced risk for first movers concerning autonomous waterborne technologies.
Improved European competitive advantage within global markets with respected to connected and autonomous shipping as well as broadening expertise across several member states and associated countries.
Exploitation of EU satellite navigation and other space based services.
Better understanding of the societal issues and consequences of automated shipping services, in particular regarding skills challenges.
*Preferably demonstrate the solution at full scale with all technology building blocks in a real world scenario. If full scale demonstration is unfeasible, solutions and key technology building blocks may be validated by means of testing within relevant environments, noting the lower project budget foreseen in this case.
Scope:
Digitisation and automation are increasingly disrupting business models and the operation of the waterborne transport sector.
Whilst digital and connected solutions are widely deployed, autonomous waterborne transport remains at an early stage of development, particularly outside of military applications. A small number of early stage demonstrators are foreseen in the coming years with modest ambition and focus. The main challenges are both technical and regulatory. Automated maritime or inland waterways feeder services are seen as the most promising applications where the feasibility and commercialisation of automated shipping can be proven. In particular, an autonomous waterborne feeder loop or shuttle service providing regular reliable, resilient and integrated supplies of freight with an ambition of zero emissions is likely to have many applications.
Developing the necessary expertise for such services provides Europe with a competitive advantage in the face of strong global competition which is investing to develop similar technologies. Autonomous waterborne feeder services are expected to disrupt logistics, remove freight from congested land infrastructures, increase safety by reducing the human factor in accidents and incidents, and make transport climate neutral. They will change business models, increasing logistic chain integration and exploiting telemetry and shore-based support, whilst modifying the role of crews and legal responsibilities which will raise further societal issues that need to be addressed. These anticipated changes to waterborne transport also require clarity concerning the local rules and regulations in order to ensure legal certainty. Project(s) is/are expected to co-operate closely with the Horizon 2020 project MOSES which is already addressing aspects of robotic cargo handling and autonomous vessel manoeuvring and docking.
Building on the current state of the art and on-going activities, proposals should address all of the following points in line with the expected outcomes above:
Develop an autonomous waterborne freight feeder loop service for inland or maritime transport suitable for specific commercial applications and which can provide an integrated, reliable, resilient, predicable fully automated service with a preference for zero GHG and pollutant emissions as well as supporting safer navigation (e.g. manoeuvring, situational awareness, collision avoidance, failsafe operations). Feeder service is to be understood to include Ro-Ro services.
Given that an IWT application will significantly differ from a short sea application common technology building blocks need to be defined and developed. Project(s) should analyse differences and communalities in sufficient detail.
Key aspects to be addressed are real time data acquisition, management, storage and exchange, and the supporting digital infrastructure(s), standards and connectivity, also addressing the potential use of Galileo GNSS services.
Develop business cases which demonstrate the viability of the proposed solutions and their impact on logistic chains. The latter will require addressing port handling and intermodality.
In addition to the vessel projects should address the port and any other necessary shore side infrastructure as well as any adaptions to existing infrastructure such as locks and bridges in the case of inland waterways transport.
Address requirements for telemetry, its architecture, infrastructure monitoring and security needed for controlling the system’s water-side and shore-side assets.
Address the necessary safety, regulatory and legal rules (including liability, COLREGs etc.) needed to deploy such services. A clear distinction needs to be made between inland navigation and short sea shipping as different legal, fiscal and commercial conditions as well as emission baselines apply. The possibility for modifications of COLREGS and similar regulations as well as a more active role of shore traffic management services should be explored.
Whilst ensuring European added value, and visibility of the European activities, engage with wider activities addressing automated shipping, including internationally within IMO, as well as supporting EU policy making in the domain of autonomous and connected shipping.
Address reliability, liability and the consequences of system failure or breakdown. Special attention needs to be given to cyber security and resilience against malicious acts in all aspects.
Address the socio-economic implications of such automated feeder services, including employment, training and skills requirements as well as the social acceptance of such vessels. The latter may have higher pertinence where vessel operations are taking place in proximity to population areas.
Broaden European autonomous waterborne transport expertise amongst EU Member States and associated countries.

Advancing the transition towards exascale capabilities by developing or scaling up existing parallel codes, resulting into effective applications to solve scientific, industrial or societal challenges and addressing the needs of the user communities.
Scope:
The Centres of Excellence (CoE) address scientific and industrial applications and user communities that run world leading codes or ensembles that aggregate to pre-exascale workloads, and may require exascale resources in specific cases.
All CoEs should be user-driven and inherently committed to co-design activities to ensure that future HPC architectures are well suited for the applications and their users (both from academia and industry), providing a high performance and scalable application base.
CoEs should federate existing resources around Europe, exploiting available competences, and ensuring multidisciplinary (combining application domain and HPC system, software and algorithm expertise) and synergies with national/regional programmes.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Development of next generation innovative effective public transport systems concepts using full electric buses (M3[1]) through e-BRT.
Present efficient, economically viable and flexible, integrated solutions of e-BRT within existing mass transport networks (all modes) and with personal mobility solutions (walk, bike, powered two-wheelers, cars etc.).
Develop innovative, integrated, infrastructure solutions combining charging, bus-stops and dedicated bus lines, for both urban and peri-urban road networks.
Development of flexible bus transport, end-user solutions, for both urban use in dense city centres and for less populated peri-urban environments, meeting future user demands of convenience, efficiency, safety and security.
Development of an international market for European e-BRT systems, in particular, in countries with low offer of public transport with challenging conditions (climate, environment, poverty, etc.).
Reduction of greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions as well as traffic congestion, by demonstrating the developed technologies and advanced electrified Bus Rapid Transit (e-BRT) concepts in European and in developing countries’ partner countries cities.
Scope:
The scale-up phase of clean and intelligent city buses should cover the most demanding routes, by switching the longest, fastest and busiest routes to electricity. Therefore, the investment in innovations in city buses (e.g. clean propulsion) can be optimized through BRT systems, as the operations can be planned, mileage is known and energy requirements can be predicted on-board since the roads and distances are familiar. As such, revisiting the concept of BRT with new, enabling technologies and solutions offers a key opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of the transport sector, particularly in cities.
Demonstration and testing in real operation are expected to be developed in four or five different European cities and at least one city in a partner country in a developing context either in Africa or in the region of Latin American and Caribbean countries. The demonstration activities should include mega-cities, larger/smaller cities and the link to peri-urban, inter-urban and sub-urban dwellings in order to afford complementary solutions in test and demonstrations. Zero tailpipe emission buses and their related infrastructure are expected to be applied in BRT lines, in different city contexts, together with the needed integration of e-BRT with other mass-public transport systems, and with personal mobility solutions. Solutions include both the physical vehicles, recharging infrastructure and the overall services offering.
Proposals are expected to address all the following:
Electrification combined with automation and connectivity enablers[2], to optimize and validate the whole advanced BRT system.
Operational concepts: increasing the capacity use rate; the average commercial speed; punctuality / regularity.
Synchronization with other city transport modes[3]; service quality whilst reducing CO2 emissions, and cost per km/passenger.
Replicability: use of the e-BRT technology under environmental, infrastructure and social conditions different from the European ones.
The focus of projects is expected to be on mass transport, full electric Bus Rapid Transit (e-BRT) systems using full size buses (M3). Vehicle, infrastructure and operational aspects have to be addressed, considering charging systems for stationary, opportunity[4] and Electric Road Systems (ERS) for buses (wireless, contact, SRS etc.) and strategies (IMC, Opportunity at stops or terminal, offline charging etc.).
Proposals are expected to take into consideration the transport operators’ and transport authorities’ needs for financial viability, effectiveness, flexibility, environment conformance, safety and security. The impact of e-BRT technologies on bus performance and on the frequency of necessary repair and maintenance work, the life duration of the bus, and the costs that have to be covered at the end of the life (recycling; upgrading etc.) might have a huge influence on the financial side and should, therefore, also be covered. The impact of the solutions implemented in the different cities in terms of GHG emissions and traffic should also be quantified. Guidelines for regional and international replication conditions to reach out a larger number of cities and countries are expected to be developed.
This topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Indeed, crosscutting issues related to socio-economic, gender, socio-cultural, and user aspects need to be addressed with the development of e-BRT systems in cities, taking into account location-specific characteristics of the implementation area, such as local policy targets, population density, and cultural matters. This will help at a better understanding and greater acceptability of such systems as well as socioeconomic benefits.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.

Lower electric vehicles (EV) cost and improved range and, therefore, a wider market penetration.

Demonstrate the following specific targets (percentages with respect to automotive state of the art in 2020):
Continuous power densities >23kW/litre and >7 kW/kg or continuous torque densities > 50Nm/litre and >20Nm/kg, for the complete motor including its cooling, allowing global performance optimisation specific for the category and type of vehicle;

A recyclability rate >60%, or demonstrating the possibility of “functional” recycling of critical raw materials by repurposing magnets without extracting the single rare elements, thus keeping a higher share of the value.
Increase high system voltages offering new opportunities for readdressing the current versus voltage trade-offs, throughout the vehicle systems and in aspects of the recharging infrastructure, duly considering potential impacts.
Guarantee the heat rejection of high energy density motors through multiphysics models in order an optimal design (use of rare resources, reduction in losses, high efficiency).
Novel manufacturing process supporting increased integration, enabling, amongst other things, improved thermal control.
The use of alternative architectures and materials to the currently used rare earths-based magnets and configurations. Recyclability plus life-cycle environmental impact aspects need to be considered, aiming at the best compromise with other performance parameters to reach the stated outcomes. If composite reinforced materials (CRM) are included in the design, the development of processes for the economic recycling of at least 60% of any rare materials needs to be included: only this additional work will justify the use of up to EUR 2 million of the expected EU contribution.
The proposed motor concepts are expected to comply with automotive standards, given the normal dynamic and duty-cycle requirements, reliability, EMC etc. The proposed concepts should consider the motor (integration of electronics, excluding their development at component level), and integration of any related transmission. The concept has to be validated through representative duty-cycle evaluation, as a minimum on the test bed or, optionally with minimum-change integration, on an existing vehicle.
The provision of a digital-twin of the concept, in-line with current best practice modelling and simulation standards, is required.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Contributions to two full scale vessel demonstrators, hybrid and fully electric, by 2027 covering a sailing distance of at least 300 nm in the case of a fully electric vessel.
*Development and validation of electrical architectures for large battery systems on-board.
*Proof of the safe integration of battery systems into the ship’s electrical grid for a relevant number of ship types (e.g. IWT, short sea vessels, cruise ships, ferries) and operational scenarios.
*Verification of the architecture and the power management system for two cases: hybrid and fully electric.
*Documentation of skills requirements for the crew.
*In the short term, facilitate full battery electric transit for reduced noise and zero emissions on shorter routes (up to 100 nm) and during approach and harbour stay.
Scope:
Electrification and electrical energy storage is one of the major drivers for climate neutrality in the waterborne sector. 100% electrical power can potentially be used on any kind of vessel, with an initial focus on ferries and short sea shipping where re-charging can be frequent, but also extending within hybrid applications to larger vessels on longer routes as well as to high power vessels and high-end complex ships with a high number and a wide variety of electrical consumers.
Large battery based electrical energy storage systems offer the highest energy conversion efficiencies. Within fully electric ships, notably ferries, batteries are the most energy efficient method to achieve climate neutrality. Within ICE hybrid vessels batteries increase total efficiency, cutting engine peak power demands, providing a “spinning reserve” and enabling the possibility of zero emission port entries and coastal passages utilising only battery power.
The latest industrial outcomes in large marine batteries are already addressing safe, long-life and cost-effective solutions. On the other hand, at ship level, the development of systems which ensure the full integration of batteries in the ship’s highly complex electrical network is crucial to ensure the optimal use of the electrical energy stored, alone or in combination with other zero-emission ship power sources like, for instance, fuel cells.
Projects will develop solutions for the on-board integration (including the optimisation of the electrical distribution grid) and control of batteries which will maximise the operational flexibility of different ships under electric-driven zero-emission operations, focussing on an optimal operation and the longest lifetime and lowest weight of the electrical systems and its key components. While ensuring the ship's energy balance and efficiency, solutions need to address one of these two cases:
The hybrid arrangement for zero local pollution (long and complete discharge cycles), or
The full electric arrangement, plug-in charging (charging strategy and battery size adapted to route).
Strategies for safe energy management systems with sufficient safety margins need to be addressed.
Projects will also investigate (e.g. through performance modelling) different optimisation strategies for the large capacity batteries on board and will need to prove the applicability to several ship types and operational profiles. It will need to establish connections with the project(s) awarded under the Horizon 2020 call LC-BAT-11-2020 which is focused on the development of cost-efficient batteries, including the certification methodology.
Consideration should be given to technology transfer from potentially related sectors, such as the energy management from solar panel systems.
Long term skills’ development needs and strategies with the aim to provide operational transferability of the developed solutions are integral to the topic and should also be investigated.

Outcomes and deliverables
At the end of the project, a balanced network of EDIH will cover all regions in Europe, addressing the needs of the public and private sectors, including all economic sectors, offering a wide range of specialised digital transformation services.
The following indicators will be used to evaluate the performance of the hub; proposals should define their targets related to each of them:
Number of businesses and public sector entities, which have used the European Digital Innovation Hubs’ services, by user category (businesses of different sizes, public sector entities, etc.), sector, location and type of support received. Where relevant, this will include a description of which Digital Europe Programme capacities have been used.
For access to finance: amount of additional investments successfully triggered (e.g. through venture capital, bank loan, etc.).
Number of collaborations foreseen with other EDIHs and stakeholders outside the region at EU level, and description of jointly shared infrastructures / joint investments with other EDIH.
A set of additional impact indicators will be collected and analysed with the support of the Digital Transformation Accelerator:
Increase in digital maturity of organizations that have used the services of the EDIH network. Digital maturity will be defined on the basis of a questionnaire developed by the Joint Research Centre assessing the categories digital strategy and readiness, intelligence and automation, data and connectedness, green and human-centric digitalisation. The green digitalisation category will focus on the use of digital technologies to improve environmental sustainability and the inclusion of circularity in value chains.
Market maturity and market creation potential of innovations, as defined in the JRC’s Innovation Radar methodology ( https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/innovation-radar).
Cross-border trans-national hubs are possible; in this case, each Member State involved will provide the co-financing for participants legally established in their country. Grants will make use of multi-annual instalments.
Only entities that are designated by their Member State or Associated countries may apply to this call. As a proof of their designation they need to attach the letter of designation they received to their proposal.

Objective:
Set-up the Initial Network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) from all designated candidate entities resulting from the Expression of Interest (1.1). Upgrade these entities to provide the complete set of services of an EDIH, including the necessary infrastructure, in a specific geographical area, covering the needs of the local SMEs, small mid-caps and/or public sector organisations with respect to their digital transformation. Network these EDIHs with each other and with other projects selected in Digital Europe Programme developing capacities in High Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Advanced Digital Skills and accelerating the best use of these technologies.
Scope:
Each EDIH will provide services based on a specific focus/expertise, which will support the local private and public sector with their digital and green transformation. The specialisation can be strengthened over time, and should make use of existing local competencies in this area. The services will be provided on an open, transparent and non-discriminatory basis and will be targeted mainly to (1) SMEs and small-midcaps and/or (2) public sector organisations conducting non-economic activities.
Each EDIH will act as an access point to the European network of EDIHs, helping local companies and/or public actors to get support from other EDIHs in case the needed competences fall outside their competence, ensuring that every stakeholder gets the needed support wherever it is available in Europe. Reversely, each EDIH will support the companies and public actors from other regions and countries presented by other EDIHs that need their expertise.
The EDIHs will be active in networking with other hubs, sharing best practices and specialist knowledge, in bringing companies into contact with other companies of their value chain, and in seeking synergies with innovators and early adopters - including artist, designers, architects and other creatives that test solutions in novel experiments and can foster the adoption of digital technologies in working and business environments in a more human-friendly way. EDIHs will also play a brokering role between public administrations and companies providing e-government technologies. In all the networking activities, EDIHs will be supported by the Digital Transformation Accelerator (see topic 1.3), and therefore it is compulsory that EDIHs participate actively in the relevant support activities of the Digital Transformation Accelerator, such as matchmaking, training and capacity building events.
Each EDIH will make available the relevant experimentation facilities related to its specialisation. SMEs, small mid-caps and the public sector will be able to test the technologies proposed, including where relevant their environmental impact, and the feasibility of applying these technologies to their business before further investing in it.
Furthermore, they will act as a multiplier and widely diffuse the use of all the digital capacities built up under the different specific objectives of the Digital Europe Programme on High Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Advanced Digital Skills and Accelerating the best use of technologies. For this purpose, the EDIHs will participate in a “Train the trainer” programme where the specialists of the digital capacities train the EDIHs on how to use the capacities, so that the EDIHs can help their stakeholders to make use of them. It should be avoided that there is duplication of actions of the High Performance Computing competence centers,the Cybersecurity centers, the AI Testing and Experimentation Facilities and the EDIHs, and therefore working arrangements will be agreed among them, where the focus of the EDIHS will be on their role as multiplier and reaching out to all regions in Europe. The “Train the trainer” events, together with other events for the network of EDIH, will be organised by the Digital Transformation Accelerator. EDIHs should foresee active participation in those events.
EDIHs are encouraged to make use of the digital tools provided by the DTA, but are also free to use their own tools. However, interoperability with the DTA tools is a requirement, so that users of the EDIHs will have a seamless experience.
EDIHs will maintain structured long-term relationships with the relevant local actors like regional authorities, industrial clusters, SME associations, business development agencies, incubators (including European Space Agency Business Incubators, the ESA BICs), accelerators, chambers of commerce, and partners of the European Enterprise Network (EEN). Specifically, EDIHs will offer a seamless service with EEN and Startup Europe, e.g. by offering joint investor-related events, organising common trainings, workshops or info days, directing SME from EEN to EDIHs and from EDIHs to EEN as needed. It is expected that local EEN nodes that team up with a local EDIH will sign a Memorandum of Understanding to regulate their collaboration.
Finally, EDIH should become an interface for the European Commission to support the implementation of specific sectorial policies, SME policies and eGovernment policies. This will imply that EDIHs specialised in a specific sector could be consulted on policies related to their sector of competence, and could participate in specific actions, such as the New European Bauhaus initiative, where EDIHs for which it is relevant might be asked to help accelerate the take up of results and the emergence of lead markets. Another example is the “Adopt AI” programme that is currently under development as a result of the White Paper on AI (https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/white-paper-artificial-intelligence-european-approach-excellence-and-trust_en).
The Digital Transformation Accelerator will also have the role to report on overall Key Performance Indicators of the network, and therefore each EDIH will provide them with the necessary information.

","21 December 2021
","05 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
AI tools and technologies (including classifiers) to identify digital Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).
Scope:
One of the main challenges in the fight against online CSAM is the vast amount of potential new CSAM that Hotlines and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) have to assess and classify as illegal prior to takedown. In 2018, for example, national LEAs in the EU received more than 500,000 referrals stemming from US internet providers, while INHOPE Hotlines are seeing increasing numbers of reports of CSAM hosted in the EU resulting from proactive search for CSAM. Relying on human analysts alone to assess such vast quantities of material slows up both law enforcement investigations and notice and takedown actions. There is therefore an urgent need to further develop and test AI tools which support the classification of CSAM. Such AI classifier tools will help law enforcement agencies (LEAs), INHOPE Hotlines, and industry to analyse the vast amounts of digital CSAM more efficiently through automated identification and prioritization, thus leading to swifter takedown of illegal material by Hotlines and industry, and more effective investigations by LEAs.
The proposals aim to develop mature tools that support the analytical work of LEAs and Hotlines, based on relevant classifiers that correspond to typical elements/characteristics of CSAM. The tools should allow identification, categorisation and prioritisation of digital CSAM from large data sets. The solutions should be robust enough and provide sufficient information to help Hotline analysts and law enforcement officers in their assessments.
To ensure that the proposed solutions are fit for purpose and effective, INHOPE Hotlines and LEAs should be involved in each project. Working in close cooperation with them, the proposals should build on existing infrastructures and processes already available to LEAs and INHOPE Hotlines. The proposals should ensure European added value through cross-border interoperability.
The proposals should define the characteristics and granularity of classifiers required, develop the classifiers, compose and annotate representative CSAM data sets, train and test the tools in cooperation with LEAs and INHOPE Hotlines. As CSAM is illegal, these data sets need to be provided by or composed mainly in cooperation with LEAs. To reduce the development and training time on this sensitive data, the proposed tools should be able to incorporate dynamically user feedback, preferably without the need of retraining the model. The proposed tools should also allow pre-training on data available for other general tasks, like image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, etc., in order to increase the accuracy and to reduce the exposure to sensitive data during training. The tools to be developed can also include other relevant features such as text-based data analysis, audio analysis from videos and/or automated key word extraction from audio or age detection.
All tools developed throughout the projects should be made freely available as Open Source Software, also for industry to use on a voluntary basis to detect and remove illegal material.
The topic, with its focus on more effective and efficient AI-based tools for processing online CSAM by a wide range of actors (NGOs, industry, Law enforcement), complements the objectives of Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Civil Security for Society[1], which advances research into perpetrators and on tools for law enforcement intelligence. Moreover, it will build on relevant work performed in previous EU-funded projects and national initiatives.

eXtended Reality, combining human-machine interactions with real, mix, augmented and virtual environments, allows for higher engagement with teaching material and more efficient interaction with complex problems or new environments. Proposals will make use of XR technologies to develop and test virtual tools for teaching and learning.
The selected proposal will create a European reference platform on learning and teaching with XR with the aim to:
develop, apply and test the use of eXtended Reality technologies, in education , such as for virtual field trips, content creation and exploration (STEM, history, etc.), awareness of climate changes and biodiversity challenges, training of young professionals and upskilling (such as but not limited to healthcare and medical, manufacturing, construction and engineering), distance and blended learning, accessibility and inclusion;
provide access to teachers, students, parents and school administration to a reference platform where they can find educational solutions appropriate for their educational needs;
build a focal point where the EdTech and XR community (including SMEs, start-ups, companies, academia/research community, learning and instructional designers, social innovators) can share/market their existing digital educational XR solutions, including those developed in the context of EU funded projects;
further support digital start-ups, SMEs and industry active in the sector through Financial Support for Third Parties actions allowing them to further advance early prototypes of XR educational solution to a market-ready product, with the overall aim to populate the on-demand education platform;
build upon and link to existing relevant initiatives, including for instance existing platforms, catalogues or repositories;
reach out to potential user groups through awareness-raising and communication activities to boost the use of the platforms.
The project will be populated with FSTPs and smaller projects such as:
FSTP projects for fully developed, tested and ready-to-deploy digital learning solutions/apps using XR;
FSTP XR for education projects including Mini-Piloting projects/schools to be used for user-tests/examples/communication
The actions should select these small scale projects through the use of financial support to third parties. A minimum of 60% of the EU funding of the action should be allocated to the financial support of these third parties, typically of the size of EUR 150 000 to 300 000 per third party and a duration of about 9 to 12 months. Financial support to third parties should in line with the conditions set out in the General Annexes.
In order to facilitate the integration with existing IT systems and policies, the EU XR platform for education should only accept XR content, tools and solutions based on open standards, such as OpenXR and WebXR and should offer publicly available access to XR content, tools and solutions, without passing through app stores.

improve the digital technologies, solutions and interoperable frameworks for data markets and data economy (e.g. industrial, administrative and societal/cultural data platforms/data spaces), allowing for data assets to be discoverable, efficiently and fairly priced and shared/traded in a secured, user-friendly, compliant and energy-efficient way; promote the development of a European industrial ecosystem of the data economy capable of ensuring digital autonomy; develop training material to endow workers in this occupational group with the right skillset in order to deploy the new technologies
Scope:
The focus is on technologies, solutions and frameworks that facilitate the collection, sharing, storing, processing, trading and re-using of data in compliance with the legal framework and satisfying the needs, expectations and rights of the data providers, brokers, users and data subjects. Practical and scalable solutions for handling large amounts of transactions while minimizing energy consumption are necessary (e.g. smart/automated contracting, data rights management, tracking of subsequent data use). Special attention should be paid to fostering approaches that ensure data and metadata interoperability, including the application of appropriate standards, reference architectures, common ontologies/vocabularies/data models allowing smooth data sharing (also across sectors). The emphasis is on the development and demonstration of practical and mature end-to-end systems, building on the results of work on data platforms (topic H2020-ICT-13-2018-2019), privacy-preserving technologies and computing technologies under Horizon 2020 and this programme.

","05 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
A greener, more secure and resilient global Internet based on a decentralised architecture stemming from the evolution of TCP/IP and the advent of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and Blockchain.
Increased European competitiveness and open strategic autonomy in core Internet technologies, DLT and Blockchain, reinforcing the European Internet and Blockchain ecosystems and excellence in research and innovation.
A European ecosystem of top internet and Blockchain innovators, with the capacity to set the course of the Internet evolution and strengthening the role of Europe in Internet standard setting.
New business and sustainability models based on decentralised technologies and open source.
Scope:
The Internet architecture has developed as a mix of centralised, networked and device-based technologies with design choices largely coming from the past. In particular, the questions of security and energy efficiency were relatively secondary in the initial architecture design of the Internet. At the same time, ever-larger fractions of the internet as we know it today are operated by a small number of platforms controlling end-users’ data, online transactions and infrastructure, effectively leading to a concentration and centralisation of the Internet.
Proposals should focus on advancing the state-of-the-art in one of the two research areas below:
To review and upgrade the open Internet architecture (hardware, software, protocols) to increase the performance of the network, adapt it to new application requirements, improve quality of service, make it more resilient to security threats, more energy efficient and respectful of the environment (e.g. reparability, recyclability), and increasingly supportive of open and decentralised technologies and services.
Address the current limitations of decentralised technologies, such as Blockchain and DLT, including those related to scalability, interoperability, energy efficiency, privacy or security, in order to make them dependable building blocks of the future Internet. This research area will explore DLT-based solutions, enabling the exploitation of data coming from a high number and various types of sources, eliminating data silos through decentralised and interoperable approaches, while helping individuals and organisations better govern their data when they participate in joint value chains where cooperating partners can also be competitors. Such solutions should ensure a high level of trust concerning data provenance and authentication with (real-time) traceability, data integrity, data exploitation as well as data protection and privacy when it relates to individuals.
Proposals should clearly identify the research area they are addressing.
The focus is on advanced research that is linked to new technology breakthrough and real-life applications or use cases. However, apps and services that innovate without a research component are not covered by this topic. Proposals funded under this topic should include standardisation activities to promote the technologies developed in international standard setting organisations.
The proposals should support open source software and open hardware design, including how to maintain key open source building blocks of the internet, access to testing and operational infrastructures, as well as an IPR regime ensuring lasting impact and reusability of results.
Financial support to third parties
Each RIA will support third party projects from outstanding open source innovators, academic research groups, high-tech startups, SMEs and other multidisciplinary actors, so that multiple actors are funded and collectively contribute to building a more decentralised and trustworthy Internet. As the primary purpose of the action is to support and mobilise internet innovators, a minimum of 80% of the total requested EU contribution should be allocated to financial support to third parties, selected through open calls.
The consortium should provide the programme logic for the third-party projects, ensure the coherence and coordination of these projects, and provide the necessary technical support, as well as coaching and mentoring, in order to ensure that the collection of third party projects contributes to a significant advancement and impact in the research and innovation domain, including in terms of standardisation. These tasks cannot be implemented using the budget earmarked for the financial support to third parties.
Beneficiaries should make explicit the intervention logic for the area, their capacity to attract top internet and DLT talents, to deliver value-added services to the third-party projects, as well as their expertise and capacity in managing the full life-cycle of the open calls transparently and efficiently (a minimum of five open calls during the lifetime of the project). They should explore synergies with other research and innovation actions, supported at regional, national or European level, to increase the overall impact.
The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations. For ensuring focused effort, third parties will be funded through projects typically in the EUR 50 000 to 150 000 range per project, with indicative duration of 9 to 12 months.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Renewable energy assistance is commercially viable and deployed at scale in commercial shipping and maritime operations, significantly contributing to making waterborne transport climate neutral.
In the medium term, enabling the wide adoption of automated wind technologies for long distance maritime transport.
*Through full scale demonstration prove the viability at large scale of power generation and propulsion assistance systems on-board harvesting renewable energies such as wind and solar.
*System designs (including modular/drop-in) to reduce the costs of and increase confidence in refitting of the most appropriate existing vessels addressing several types of ships and different forms of renewable energy.
*System designs including power management architectures and energy efficiency solutions (including wind-assisted and wind-based propulsion) for purpose built new ships including designs that are “wind-ready”. Demonstration of efficiency gains of at least 15% for power generation or at least 25% for propulsion purposes.
*Provision of a summary and an analysis of pertinent regulatory issues and how to address them.
*Documentation of skills requirements and incentives for the crew, for different types of ships and renewables adopted.
Scope:
The use of on-board renewable energies, in particular automated wind assistance, has potential to substantially reduce the ship’s energy demands and hence reduce fuel consumption. Wind energy, harvested through e.g. rotors, hard and soft sails, kites, suction wings, turbines or specific hull forms, can serve multiple purposes on-board, including in particular primary propulsion with the additional beneficial effect of noise reduction. Potentially more expensive climate neutral fuels and carbon taxes will further enhance the economic benefits from efficiency gains and the exploitation of freely available renewable energies. With wind being a genuinely maritime feature shipping would also avoid costly competition with other transport sectors for sustainable fuels.
Whilst some renewable energy systems have been trialled at comparatively small scale, for particular routes and ship types, their scale has often been too small to provide conclusive data, and robust systems applicable for long distance trans-oceanic shipping are not yet available. R&I is needed to harvest the wind energy potential, significantly enlarging the current scale and expanding the typology for a much wider range of applications, demonstrating cost-effective, safe, reliable and easy-to-handle technologies in a variety of conditions. These conditions should be considered variable and dynamic if combined with beneficial changes in operational profiles such as advanced (satellite enabled) weather routing. The optimisation of aerodynamic efficiency of devices and the reduction of superstructure drags will be considered.
Overall energy efficiency strategies and architectures for the power management in large ships will be developed, with an optimised and self-adaptive operation of wind power systems as part of a hybrid architecture. For certain ship types and routes wind energy could become the main propulsion. This may in particular apply to smaller craft and fishing vessels (in transit) or to ships where wind propulsion can free bunker spaces for more paying cargo or passengers. In these cases attention needs to be given to the most practical and efficient system installation (e.g. retractable, auto-furling, hinged, multi-positional).
Projects are expected to address both retrofitting existing ships and new purpose built designs, taking into account regulatory issues and making use of the existing guidelines by classification societies on wind-assisted shipping. Large scale testing and preferably demonstration is expected. Attention should be given to the conditions under which renewable power sources on-board compete with specific fuel solutions in terms of life cycle and opportunity costs, proven sustainability and reliable sourcing, and operational risks in order to make the most convincing business case.
In addition to wind, other renewables such as solar electric systems should be considered for different ship types, to the extent they can significantly contribute to the ship’s overall power systems.

Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced EU cooperation with the US and Canada in the development of Next Generation Internet technologies, services and standards.
Supporting the EU internet policy objectives by sharing the EU vision and values with US and Canadian counterparts and forging bonds through concrete collaborations.
An EU-US-Canada ecosystems of top researchers, hi-tech start-ups / SMEs and Internet-related communities collaborating on the evolution of the Internet according to a human-centric approach.
Generate new business opportunities for European Internet innovators based on decentralised technologies and open source.
Scope:
The aim of the topic is to reinforce EU cooperation and strategic partnerships with the US and Canada in the area of Next Generation Internet, and to establish a continuous dialogue among the actors involved in the US, Canadian and EU programmes, in particular as far as internet standardisation is concerned. The focus should be on trust and data sovereignty, in particular digital identity, and on internet architecture renovation and decentralised technologies.
A RIA will organise open calls for joint projects involving EU teams together with USA and/or Canadian teams on emerging topics for the EU Next Generation Internet and corresponding US and Canadian programmes, including technology development, joint demonstrators and joint contributions to standards. The proposal should support open source software and open hardware design, open access to data, standardisation activities, access to testing and operational infrastructures as well as an IPR regime ensuring lasting impact and reusability of results.
Financial support to third parties
Each RIA will support third party projects, from open source developers, to academic researchers, hi-tech startups, SMEs and other multidisciplinary actors, so that multiple actors are funded and collectively contribute to enhancing EU cooperation with the USA and Canada in the development of Next Generation Internet technologies and services. As the primary purpose of the action is to support and mobilise internet innovators, a minimum of 80% of the total requested EU contribution should be allocated to financial support to third parties, selected through open calls.
The consortium should provide the programme logic for the third-party projects, ensure the coherence and coordination of these projects, and provide the necessary technical support, as well as coaching and mentoring, in order to ensure that the collection of third party projects contributes to a significant advancement and impact in the research and innovation domain and in advancing EU collaboration with the US and Canada. These tasks cannot be implemented using the budget earmarked for the financial support to third parties.
Beneficiaries should make explicit the intervention logic for the area, their capacity to attract top internet talents, to deliver value-added services to the third-party projects, as well as their expertise and capacity in managing the full life-cycle of the open calls transparently and efficiently (a minimum of five open calls during the lifetime of the project). They should explore synergies with other research and innovation actions, supported at national or European level, to increase the overall impact.
The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations. For ensuring focused effort, third parties will be funded through projects typically in the EUR 50 000 to 100 000 range per project, with indicative duration of 3 to 9 months.

Improved security of maritime infrastructures and maritime transport, including sea harbours and their entrance routes;
Improved detection of illicit and dangerous goods and/or of threats hidden below the water surface, either threatening infrastructures or vessels, or moving alone or connected to vessels.
Scope:
Security of maritime infrastructures and transport is key to support the movement of people and trade to, from, and within Europe. Furthermore, it is important to strengthen capabilities for security in and of sea harbours and of their entrance routes, and detection, prevention and response to illicit activities in and near sea harbours, including in the underwater sea space. Both legal and illegal activities in the maritime domain increase and become more sophisticated and this presses on security practitioners to build and improve their capabilities to keep up and fulfil their tasks in the future.
A particularly critical environment would include the abilities to detect and act below the water surface. Possible threats concealed below the water surface should be detected. Criminal organizations for example have the modus operandi of hiding narcotic cargos under the water surface of large and medium-sized vessels. Detection and response capabilities against active threats below the surface (such as terrorist attacks against ships or harbour infrastructures) should also be developed. Security controls and fiscal manifest verifications on closed containers and cargo should be supported by information gathered below water surface.
Research could develop solutions to detect and identify anomalies below the water surface and/or automatically assess for below the water surface threats to a ship at harbour entrance and/or a pier. Projects should demonstrate, test and validate solutions working from detection to minimisation of threats from below the water surface. Research and innovation activities should focus on delivering advanced autonomous or semi-autonomous vessel screening capabilities (detection of underwater smuggling – for example in cylindrical containers).
Research proposals should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate, previous research, including but not limiting to research by other projects funded by the Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation.

Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved capabilities of border management and law enforcement practitioners to identify citizens and the use of identity and travel documents and credentials in the context of border and police checks, for a better, more reliable and more secure experience for citizens and security practitioners, including in connection to optimised e-Government settings;
Improved capabilities of border management and law enforcement practitioners to defend identity and document/credential management against attacks to their security and attempts to falsify biometrics, identity thefts and online frauds;
Improved knowledge for European approaches to future identity management systems and document and credential security, building on and integrating with existing tools and respecting the privacy of European citizens.
Scope:
Research will build capabilities to prevent, detect and respond to challenges to the security and reliability of identity management and identity and travel documents, in the context of border and police checks. Research should also address solutions for integrated secure identity creation, protection and management in the context of future increasingly “digitalised” borders; and contribute to improve the performance and the comfort of the border and police checks experience for both security authorities’ operators and the users.
New challenges for secure identity management and secure identity and travel documents could emerge in the coming years and decades. Solutions will hence have to enable new capabilities while at the same time ensuring both privacy and security of identity and identity documents. Future electronic identification systems will have to safeguard key parameters of identity management, such as security, efficiency, user friendliness, trust, privacy and protection of data. Electronic identifications (eIDs) can be carried on mobile devices, to respond to security requirements, ease of use and range of applications. In addition, it is necessary to ensure the reliability and link among the information contained on identity supports and their owner, to avoid the possibility of having authentic documents with false information. Research can focus on security and privacy enhancing features in new eID ecosystems and/or on innovative identity lifecycle processes.
Areas of research could include exploring solutions against morphing attacks to the security of identity and travel documents, including robust algorithms to detect morphing, as well as against other possible future attempts and techniques to falsify biometrics; methods to validate and verify identity at borders or police checks; or advanced and privacy-enhanced technologies for the security of identity, breeder and travel documents. Research should explore novel solutions for document verification and fraud detection, including Manipulation Attack Detection (MAD) and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) at border checks.
The proposed solutions should act not only at technological level, but should also propose new approaches to the traditional central authority architecture. The solutions should take into account the management of sensitive information and include an assessment of legal and ethical issues.
Solutions have the potential to contribute to future evolutions of European identity strategies based on eIDAS (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services), and could explore synergies with tools offered by the eIDAS Regulation.
Research proposals should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limiting to research by other Framework Programmes projects such as those on capabilities for document security, as well as EU studies on potential applications of technologies to the improvement of border management capabilities.

Smart functionalities with sensing developed to detect irreversible reactions and self-healing functionalities designed to repair damage occurred within the cell, Europe can develop cells with much higher quality, better reliability and longer cycle life. This call is building on the long-term research roadmap of BATTERY 2030+. The proposal should also cover the contribution and collaboration to the BATTERY 2030+ large scale initiative.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased quality, reliability and life (QRL) of the battery system by integrating both sensing and self-healing functionalities at the battery cell level.
Disruptive battery cell and battery management system technologies, to support a competitive and sustainable battery manufacturing industry in Europe.
Scope:
The target of this call is to embed sensors and self-healing functionalities into single battery cell, with sensors being capable to detect defective operation and trigger self-repairing functionalities via the Battery Management System (BMS).
Proposal should aim at a combined approach with the development of sensors capable of continuous, long term operation within the cell and on the development of self-healing functionalities which can be triggered by external stimulus. Sensors and self-healing functionalities need to be adapted to detection of the critical degradation processes during cell electrochemical or chemical ageing. Different battery chemistries can be addressed with a focus on most critical degradation processes.
Proof of concept of coupling sensors and self-healing agents via BMS should be demonstrated. Clear benefit of embedding smart functionalities into battery cells should be demonstrated and approach needs to be adaptable to battery cells mass production processes and not hinder subsequent recycling process. Estimation of QRL over the life span should be assessed and the competitive advantage over alternative approaches like replacement or recycling or second-use should be demonstrated.
Building upon the BATTERY 2030+ roadmap, this call topic addresses the need to develop new sensors and self-healing functionalities which can give the batteries of the future increased life-time, efficient re-use and better commercial success. The benefit of these innovation on the global battery safety should be demonstrated. The proposal should also cover the contribution and collaboration to the BATTERY 2030+ large scale initiative.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Competitiveness of the European battery industry across the value chain (from cell manufacturers to cell integrators);
Shorter time-to-market;
Reduced time and/or cost of battery development by at least 20% to 30%;
Improved battery design, for longer lifetime, and better reliability and safety;
Reduced investment and operational costs of battery systems.
Scope:
The current way of developing batteries is mainly based on trial-and-error processes, which are time consuming, costly, and do not always lead to the best product design. It is particularly the case when it comes to testing batteries to assess their performance, lifetime, reliability and safety. Existing methods and tools lead to high costs, because of long test durations, and/or the high number of required test samples, and/or the use of costly test infrastructures. There is a significant room for improvement, by relying on digital methods and tools to minimise the use of standard trial-and-error processes. Digitalisation of battery testing will lead to an acceleration of the battery development time, a higher quality of the battery assessment (better evaluation of battery performances, lifetime, reliability and safety), and an improvement of the battery design itself (by better adapting the design to the application requirements and production capabilities) and a better estimation lifetime (by better modelling of battery ageing). Improvement in battery testing will result in major cost savings, in particular in the development phase (test before invest).
Projects are expected to provide novel methods and tools to accelerate and improve the battery testing process. A multi-scale approach should be used, by covering the value chain from battery cells to battery systems (here, a battery system refers to an energy storage unit integrating battery cells, excluding power converters). Projects should propose and validate a new paradigm based on intelligent design of experiment (to avoid duplicated experiments, or experiments that give low-quality information), the smart combination of physical and virtual testing, hardware in the loop solutions, and the development and use of advanced models describing battery cells and systems (physics-based models, data-driven models, or hybrid models) and the relevant expected evolution in multiple different conditions of usage. In turn, this requires full documentation of new modules, models or tools developed from scratch or substantially improved. Particular attention should be paid to the assessment of battery lifetime, reliability and safety, including the development of innovative methods for testing of safety in transport and safety in usage, based on representativeness of the method for the various potential failures (failure initiation, propagation control, mitigation means, etc…).Projects should have an ambition for cross-sectorial applications, and should focus on battery chemistries currently on the market or that will reach the market in the short term (i.e., advanced lithium-ion chemistries), with the potential to quickly adapt to next-generation battery chemistries (i.e., solid-state lithium-based chemistries).

Spreading of excellence in future battery technologies across Europe, increased awareness of European activities and availability of European curricula in the field.
Increased synergies and collaboration between the relevant research and innovation stakeholders in Europe as well as with major initiatives that already exist or are under preparation.
Scope:
This call topic aim to network and coordinate the BATTERY 2030+ large scale research initiative on Future Battery Technologies and its contribution to the broader efforts of the European research and innovation stakeholders in battery technologies foreseen at European level and in the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan and to tackle long-term research challenges expected to result in 'game changing' impacts on future battery technologies paving the way for providing a technological competitive advantage to the European battery industry. Because of their ambition, their scale and their interdisciplinary nature, these challenges can only be realised through a long-term, coordinated and sustained effort at European level, by building on large scale research cooperation across academia and industry and with other research initiatives at regional, national and European level, and by mobilising Europe's best researchers around an ambitious long-term research agenda.
Proposals are expected to coordinate the research activities and the stakeholders participating in the initiative; to facilitate communication, dialogue and cooperation on crosscutting topics; to monitor the initiative's progress and maintain its roadmap; to provide support for its governance; to establish a robust and reliable knowledge base including key methodologies and established results; to promote and communicate the objectives of the initiative and its achievements, including by ensuring media presence and public visibility, by engaging with industry and society and by participating or organising outreach events; to identify training and education needs and promote European curricula in future battery technologies. In particular, proposals should identify and coordinate relevant efforts for modelling and data sharing, standardisation, intellectual property rights in cooperation with other relevant initiatives at European level. They should also help networking and collaboration with other relevant national and international activities in the field.

Next-generation battery system technologies for electrification of a broad range of transport and mobile applications (including road, waterborne, airborne, and rail transport, as well as non-road mobile machinery).
Demonstrating increased performances (energy density, power density, lifetime) and safety of battery systems, to improve the competitiveness of the European battery industry in the transport market.
Novel design and process to reduce manufacturing, refurbishment, dismantling and recycling costs of battery systems.
Scope:
Batteries are key for a climate neutral transport sector, which represents around 25% of the total CO2 emissions in the EU. The electrification of transport and mobile applications require high-performance and safe battery systems. In particular, fire is a critical safety risk for several transport modes.
Projects are expected to develop innovative battery systems technologies that will benefit several transport and mobile applications, by significantly improving performances and safety, as well as environmental sustainability and cost.
In order to leverage the full potential of the research ongoing in Europe at the battery material and cell levels, projects should consider the adaptation of battery system design to novel cell chemistries that will reach the market in the short-to-medium term (e.g., advanced lithium-ion or solid-state cells). Enhancing the cell-on-system volume ratio and/or weight ratio will increase the energy density and/or power density at the battery system level. More generally, projects should consider new technologies (battery system materials, mechanical design, electrical architectures, thermal management strategies, etc.) for enhancing performances and safety (for example, novel lightweight materials with optimum thermal characteristics to decrease battery module and pack weight and simultaneously enhancing safety; new dielectric cooling liquids with enhanced fire-retardant properties; etc.).
Manufacturability and recyclability should be explicitly addressed, in order to reduce the manufacturing, refurbishment, dismantling and recycling costs as well as the carbon footprint of the new battery systems.
Furthermore, the projects are expected to develop and assess methodologies to ensure the safety throughout the full battery lifetime.
The projects should focus on the battery system level, i.e., on the integration of battery cells into a battery system (e.g., a battery pack), considering mechanical, electrical and thermal aspects.
The integration of battery systems into larger systems of application (e.g., into vehicles) is out of scope for this topic, but obviously projects are expected to provide for requirements of the chosen use cases.
Project outcomes should be applicable to one or several use cases among the main transport or mobiles applications (such as road, waterborne, airborne and rail transport, as well as non-road mobile machinery and industrial applications), with the aim to maximise the impact on the European industry and on CO2 emission reduction. Projects may consider the key performance indicators proposed by Batteries Europe or by the dedicated Partnerships, reflected in the Partnership Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), to guide the technology developments on the application segments and use cases that will be selected. Some of the project results can also be relevant for stationary energy storage applications.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
New physics and data-based approaches for battery management, with the potential to enhance performances, lifetime, reliability and safety of battery systems for transport and stationary applications.
New physics and data-based approaches for battery management facilitating predictive maintenance, and/or knowledge-driven end-of-life management of battery systems, and/or the development of more accurate degradation models.
Scope:
Battery management plays an essential role by ensuring an efficient and safe battery operation. However, current battery management systems (BMS) typically rely on semi-empirical battery models (such as equivalent-circuit models) and on a limited amount of measured data. Consequently, there is currently a lack of knowledge about the overall state of the battery in operation, resulting in suboptimal utilisation.
Projects are expected to substantially advance the state of the art in the field of battery management, by developing innovative physics and data-based approaches, both at the software and hardware levels to ensure an optimised and safe utilisation of the battery system during all modes of operation.
Projects should pave the way towards next-generation BMS, which will leverage on an increased computational capability enabling the execution of advanced software, and on the ability to acquire, communicate and analyse large amount of data. Those next-generation BMS will lead to significantly enhanced performances, lifetime, reliability and safety of the battery system, by a dynamic update of battery usage limitations and the possibility to widen the battery operating range in a controlled manner. Moreover, they will provide open access to an increased amount of FAIR[1] data (which can possibly be processed offline), enabling the development of effective degradation models (thus reducing the investments costs of storage systems by mean of improved sizing during the design phase), and facilitating predictive maintenance and end-of-life management.
Projects are expected to develop technologies at both the software and hardware levels, with a validation through a lab-scale prototype at TRL 4. Several of the following items should be addressed: the development and implementation of physics-based battery models (e.g., ageing phenomena models); adaptable battery models (e.g., based on operation data); sensor-based solutions at the battery system level (e.g., with respect to sensor integration, communication with the battery management, data fusion, data analysis); advanced state estimators (e.g., state of health, state of function, state of energy, state of power, state of safety); methods for the prognosis of remaining useful lifetime and ageing; methods for the early detection or prediction of failures; solutions for the management of special situations (e.g., unbalanced or dysfunctional cells). Project results should be applicable to a broad range of transport or stationary applications.
The selected projects are invited to participate to BRIDGE[2] activities when considered relevant.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Strengthening Europe’s battery cell industrial manufacturing value chain by building-up its Giga scale manufacturing capabilities distributed in the member states territories.
Development of new battery cell manufacturing machinery, with priority on minimising energy needed for cells production, enhancement of plant efficiency rates and integration of intelligent control processes to minimise scrap.
Enabling deeper collaboration between (i) battery process equipment companies (ii) industrial-scale cell manufacturing, (iii) material, energy and other supply chain sectors benefitting from sector coupling.
To stimulate and intensify the collaboration between pilot line operators, industrial-scale academia, cell manufacturing companies and European equipment companies to push innovations with regard to an economically and ecologically sustainable cell production in Europe.
Scope:
In order to build globally competitive Li ion battery (LIB) cell production plants in Europe, all the production value chain from machinery to plant and site development and optimisation is expected to be considered holistically, from machinery development to plant and site integration and optimisation. This topic intents to cover both areas.
In recent years Europe has developed strong competences in Li ion battery technology with regard to academic research, material development and Battery system design. However, there is still a lack of knowledge and competence regarding the economically and ecologically production of LIB cells in both high volumes in Giga-factories or in much smaller batches for specialised applications as developed in Mega-factories. From this perspective, the scope of this topic is two-fold:
From one side, to be able to supply machinery which is developed and built locally, Europe has to develop a leading position in the production of resource efficient, intelligent electrode and cell manufacturing machinery.
In the development of such battery manufacturing machinery, important aspects for success include: minimising energy consumption, eliminating air and water pollution and integration of intelligent control processes to minimise scrap thus reducing costs and environmental impact of the production process. In addition, such machinery is expected to operate at very high productivity levels with incorporate intelligent quality control systems. Moreover, strategies of industry 4.0 should be intensively integrated in new European cell production plants to yield economic success.
Activities under this topics would cover from TRL 3 (start) to TRL 6 (target).
From the other side, battery cell production as a whole is currently confronted with enormous cost pressure. One major factor in the cost structure of European Giga-scale battery cell production is related to highly energy consuming manufacturing processes. A significant reduction and/or utilisation of low-carbon and low-emission energies would not only bring economic benefits, but would also provide clear advantages in terms of the ecological footprint. For sustainable success, the horizontal integration of the European supply chain for battery process equipment into the growing production of giga-scale battery cells is a major challenge.
Activities under this topic would cover from TRL 6 (today) to TRL 7 (target).
Hence, this topic aims at closing a gap and enabling deeper collaboration between industrial-scale cell manufacturing, battery process equipment companies, and material and other industrial sectors potentially benefitting from sector coupling with cell manufacturing (e.g. grid power or material suppliers).
Therefore, existing cell production lines and their material and energy flow internally and externally interaction with other companies at the site should be investigated and evaluated. Based on this, the network should investigate the ecological impact of different machinery, production line configurations and factory designs to come to best practice proposals. Another challenge is to implement ecological standards along the production chain together with material suppliers and factory operators.
One additional target to achieve these goals is to stimulate and intensify the collaboration between pilot line operators (e.g. which should be organised within the LiPLANET network), industrial-scale academia, cell manufacturing companies and European equipment companies to push innovations with regard to an economically and ecologically sustainable cell production in Europe. This includes the support from running activities including for example IPCEI's on batteries.

","10 January 2023","ExpectedOutcome:
The EU aims to be climate neutral in 2050, and to achieve this goal wind energy technologies will need to unlock its full potential on low-cost reliable clean energy generation. Thus, the next generation of wind farms will need to be supported by an even more innovative set of physical and digital tools as well as operational controls, collectively called wind farm control. Generally, wind farm control refers to the coordination of different wind turbines within a wind farm to better the overall farm power production, and to reduce the structural loading among wind turbines[1].
In this context, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Development of open source data-driven tools to decrease energy costs on operation, while increasing total wind farm output, and a parallel evaluation of operational risks arising from the chosen solution, including e.g. limitations from machine learning (AI) and resilience against third-party fraud, i.e. operational security.
Development of digital and physical tools, as well as interoperable frameworks and controls, for enhanced data collection, analysis, and operation aimed at an improved performance at farm level.
Allow operators to make better informed decisions on farm-wide system optimisation, lifetime extension, decommissioning and/or recycling of components.
Contribute to LCOE reduction in line with the SET Plan targets (actions should clearly justify the estimated LCOE at project start and end).
Scope:
The proposal is expected to address all the following aspects:
Address and validate how digital innovation on wind farm control are able to provide more stable, resilient, secure, reliable and affordable energy, while retaining high levels of cybersecurity. Focus on farm output maximization is expected. Additionally, focus on reduced component load is strongly encouraged.
Address how these data-driven innovations reduce operational and maintenance costs, increase energy output, and their impact on (component, turbine, farm) lifetime;
Address the role of such innovations as a prognostic tool, regarding failures and damages:
Develop and release an open source digital/AI solution for sector uptake. This tool is expected to be built from concrete experiments and data measurements. Further, it should account for the advent of large wind turbines (up to 20 MW) and include those in the development of this tool.

Photovoltaic power generation is pivotal in the transition towards a clean energy system and the achievement of the zero-emissions target. To that end, it is important to enhance affordability, security of supply and sustainability of PV technologies along with further efficiency improvements. Consequently, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Increase the potential of thin-film technologies for mass production, low cost and/or specialised applications.
Reinforce the European PV value chain, support local companies to develop and sell differentiated PV products.
Allow for an efficient use of available areas for renewable energy generation/ reducing competition between different kinds of land use by further increasing PV energy yield/m2.
Enable and facilitate large-scale deployment of PV and generation of renewable electricity.
Scope:
An alternative to c-Silicon PV is thin-film solar cells, which can be fabricated on various and flexible substrates (including glass, metal foils and polymers). A benefit of thin-film PV is the lower direct semiconductor materials cost. Realising lower costs in production requires high input material utilisation and low raw materials conversion costs. Largescale thin-film module production can be more cost efficient when utilising rapid processing technologies. With further advances in scientific understanding, 25% efficiency devices are within reach as are even higher efficiencies in tandem architectures. Translating those device and process advances to manufacturing technology will dramatically reduce LCOE once sufficiently scaled in both module size and production volume. This will require adapting deposition processes for higher rates and to larger-scale equipment while developing suitable robust techniques for inline process and quality control.
The proposal should address all of the following:
Develop novel environmentally benign thin-film technology concepts that optimise PV cell and module architecture, increase durability, decrease losses (minimising also the cell-to-module efficiency gap) and target very high efficiencies (>25%) with flexibility for specific applications.
Employ simple, scalable and low cost/low energy consumption and higher rate deposition processes.
Ensure compliance with all relevant standards, including those related to the specific applications targeted.
Perform device/module real–life (under actual outdoor operating conditions) characterisation for reliability and energy yield assessment.
Perform a life cycle analysis to bring evidence of the lower environmental impact, better resource efficiency than current commercial PV technologies, and circularity potential.

Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
A holistic approach to lowering transport infrastructure environmental impact, which takes into account the whole life cycle of transport infrastructure; carbon-neutral construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure
Implementation of circular economy principles (for example, by fostering new solutions and systems that are easy to maintain, repair, update, adapt and replace and by maximising the re-use/recycle of infrastructure components) to reduce emissions and the environmental impact; 100% reutilisation of construction materials within or across transport modes.
Performance-based design models and manufacturing techniques (e.g. additive and subtractive manufacturing) with the objective to substantially reduce materials consumption in construction and maintenance activities.
Enhanced modular construction, maintenance and decommissioning interventions able to reduce life cycle cost (LCC) by at least 30%.
Optimisation of energy use and increased share of renewable energy for infrastructure management operations as a way leading to achieving energy neutrality
Novel governance, public procurement and data utilization models to decrease the emissions and carbon footprint of the whole life cycle of transport infrastructure by 20%
Scope:
The overall objective of the topic is to support the development of sustainable transport infrastructure, addressing its environmental and economic efficiency dimensions.
Research should provide knowledge and technical solutions to limit transport emissions, both caused by transport infrastructure and to which transport infrastructure contributes, as the infrastructure related emissions are often unaccounted for. This in due to the long time between construction and decommissioning. Projects should cover the whole life cycle of transport infrastructure to which extent transport infrastructure design can influence and limit the overall emissions from construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure.
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:
Development of new methods and technologies to construct, manage and maintain transport infrastructure in order to further contribute to lowering emissions while allowing for cost saving.
Fostering of green, sustainable and innovative public procurement (particularly focused on the reduction of emissions, recycling and climate adaptation and mitigation).
Development of smart techniques for effective construction, maintenance and decommissioning tasks leading to zero emissions from transport infrastructure. Modular, standard and prefabricated solutions need to be considered. Additive manufacturing techniques (e.g. 3D-printing) can be also taken into account. Recycling and reuse of materials should be also incorporated into the automated processes.
Design and development of solutions for reduction of emissions through more efficient energy management on transport infrastructure operations by, for example energy harvesting on infrastructure and its verges, adaptive lighting systems, self-powered signalling systems and innovative tunnel ventilation. The proposed solutions should take into consideration existing regulations.
Validation of all the proposed solutions in at least three demonstration pilots at minimum TRL7, considering different environments and phases of the infrastructure life cycle, , namely design, construction, maintenance and decommissioning.
Proposals should build on previous results from projects on sensoring, digitalisation, asset management, decision support and automation in the construction and maintenance of infrastructures.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
An adaptive multimodal European freight transport and logistics network, including its international connections, that reacts quickly and seamlessly upon disruptions (including pandemics), hence minimising the damage and shortening the recovery time while significantly reducing emissions.
European freight transport and logistics networks which are resilient by design, thanks to better operational interconnectivity of the stakeholders, services provided based on real-time status information, pre-defined alternative routes and synchro-modal approaches, robust data management, secure and resilient digital logistic and network management tools.
New cost-efficient business models and services towards resilient and zero-emission logistics are adopted by the sector in the short-medium term, also supported by appropriate regulatory frameworks and participatory planning processes.
Scope:
New production and distribution trends (e.g. globalisation, lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventory) as well as emerging digital technologies have introduced new kinds of challenges to the supply chain. Together with resilient and smart infrastructures, new concepts, innovative solutions and better cooperation of operators are needed for freight transport to minimise the negative impacts of disruptions, shorten the recovery and ease the transition time, while taking in due account emissions and energy consumption reductions as feasible.
Research and innovation actions will have to bring together stakeholders at various level, from supply chain (e.g. manufacturers, retailers, freight forwarders and logistics service providers), transport services (e.g. transport operators, enforcing authorities) and infrastructure networks (e.g. road / rail / inland waterways operators and transport node public authorities) to ensure a truly integrated and jointly acceptable approach.
Proposals will have to:
Evaluate the resilience of strategic logistics networks and their related data and IT systems and propose management systems and operations, including alternative networks and transport services, to increase their resilience against natural, accidental and human triggered disruptive events. Proposed concepts and solutions should be suitable to increase the resilience and sustainability of the entire transport network. Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 crisis on how to make supply chains concurrently more resilient to large-scale shocks and environmentally friendly should be considered.
Develop and demonstrate how synchro-modal approaches (shipment split and merge, dynamic synchronisation of multimodal schedules, realignment in case of disruptions etc.) provide resilience and sustainability by design to the freight transport and logistics networks in which these services are operated.
Develop business intelligence capabilities, such as intermodal freight corridor performance and resilient measurement and assessment (e.g. evaluate what could be the alternative logistics networks and services to manage a failure in a main infrastructure in a transport corridor).
Define cost-efficient and green new business models able to be adopted by the sector in the short-medium term and propose business/regulatory roadmaps and recommendations to support the adoption of the new proposed approaches and other solutions enhancing the capability to manage disruptions.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Establishing synergies with projects funded under the Cluster 3 Civil Security for Society topic ‘Ensured infrastructure resilience in case of Pandemics’ could be envisaged.

Integrated Nature-based solutions (NBS) into overall concepts for the protection of infrastructures and existing integrated risk management plans for cities and urban areas with a view of complementing existing methods for protection and resilience
Adaptation and mitigation strategies for infrastructure protection applied by local authorities and operators, including lessons learned from studying reactions of natural eco-systems to different external shocks
Resilience of local infrastructures enhanced by integrating local knowledge from population and historical documents, as well as natural components in their physical assets preventing potential damages from different types of hazards, including storms, floods and heatwaves.
Novel construction materials and solutions resulting in more durable and damage resistant infrastructure
Full potential of Nature-based Solutions exploited by local authorities and operators to mitigate the risks related to multiple hazards manifesting at the same time, while also taking into account social empowerment and environmental co-benefits like leisure, clean air, and immunity and response to cyberattacks etc.
Scope:
The aim of the topic is to expand the knowledge on Nature-based Solutions (NBS) and their ability to enhance infrastructure resilience in cities and urban areas against natural and man-made hazards. Thus complementing other traditional security measures.
Cities are undergoing a rapid transformation most notably due to their digitisation. Besides this, the need for solutions to make them more sustainable and environmentally friendly has been addressed in many research projects, mainly from the perspective of climate adaptation. In this regard, nature-based solutions combined with local knowledge offer a potential also for security research on infrastructures. Such solutions can help and provide business opportunities to make cities more resilient against natural disasters and possibly other security challenges. Under Horizon 2020, the European Commission has brought together several experts to deliver a recommendation on ‘Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities[1]’ in form of a comprehensive report. They delivered the definition of NBS as: ‘actions which are inspired by, supported by or copied from nature. Some involve using and enhancing existing natural solutions to challenges, while others are exploring more novel solutions, for example mimicking how non-human organisms and communities cope with environmental extremes.’
EU-funded and national research activities have demonstrated the significant opportunities of NBS with regard to for example improved resilience, climate adaptation and the reduction of pollution in cities. What concerns security, projects have been focussing on the effects that NBS can have for prevention (for example flood-plains and mangroves for flood protection, natural source water protection, green roofs and pavements for heat and water absorption). The reduction of disaster risks and the potential for enhanced resilience of cities against different natural hazards are a priority to be put in place when applying NBS. Besides man-made hazards, Europe is facing increasingly frequent and intense natural hazards, including epidemics, droughts, heat waves, storms, floods and wildfires, which trigger needs for constant innovation when it comes to the protection of people. With the continuing increase of population concentrated in cities and urban areas and increasing impacts of climate change, such risks present a significant challenge in this regard.
NBS can offer the tools to address the potential to improve risk management and resilience using approaches that can provide greater benefit than conventional tools at the same time, like for example heat waves and wildfires, or storms and floods. The detailed understanding of ecosystems and how nature responds to different external shocks can help to strengthen existing strategies for urban resilience and deliver new approaches in protection, for example by integrating natural components in the different infrastructure assets.
Proposals should include a strong involvement of citizens/civil society, together with academia/research, industry/SMEs and government/public authorities. The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more local authorities and/or other relevant authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation with countries pioneering the development of NBS is advised.

Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
Autonomous surveillance, detection and fast and coordinated response based on updated integrated contingency plans to threats against different types of infrastructures in order to support existing security measures, reduce the risk to human personnel and allowing for mitigation in locations that are hard to reach (underwater, underground, high altitude, etc.) and without or just limited telecoms-connection
Long term deployment of autonomous solutions for the decontamination of large scale infrastructures (including in public urban areas) in case of the release of CBRN-materials, or with specific regard to support efforts to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, preventing and responding to pandemics
Long term deployment of autonomous solutions/systems/devices to detect CBRN threats in a fast, secure and forensic way
Consideration of system performance, interdependencies, new failure modes and conditions that need to be in place for this to work as intended
Concepts for the use of advanced materials, smart technologies and built-in monitoring and repair capabilities to reduce the destructive potential of natural disasters and (terrorist) attacks on infrastructures
Improved knowledge and solutions for the protection and response against large-scale attacks or intentional disruptions with (fast moving) unmanned vehicles or other moving objects reducing critically the time to react also close to residential areas
Enhanced knowledge on the ethical and legal impact on individuals and society as a whole of the use of robotics in order to maintain the vital functions of society
Scope:
Time is critical to prepare and react to disruptions of infrastructures. Faster and coordinated interventions can significantly reduce the impact, avoid negative cascading effects or in the best case prevent disruptions. The increasing interconnectivity of infrastructures has also led to bigger complexity in regards to the detection and response to incidents and certain technologies can be misused to conduct attacks or targeted disruptions of infrastructures. As underlined in the Security Union Strategy this is for example the case for scenarios involving unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). It could however also be relevant for possible incidents with land- or sea borne devices approaching at very high speed.
In order to allow for the best possible detection of threats and quick response and restoration of performance levels (e. g. through decontamination of the affected material/person; detection as well as mitigation of a risk), autonomous systems for infrastructure protection are a promising field of research. Many state-of-the art technologies used in other areas (for example: advanced robots or other autonomous detection and repair capabilities based on artificial intelligence) combined with user centred approaches, have the potential to significantly reduce the reaction time and can provide therefore an added value also for security solutions. Besides a reduced reaction time, the use of autonomous systems can reduce the risk for human responders, which is important for dangerous operations as for example in gas or chemical plants, or CBRN contaminated areas. At the same time, such systems can access challenging locations, such as underground cables, underwater pipes or assets in high altitude. Those features do not only present an advantage in responding to intentional acts, but also allow for faster and more efficient response to natural disasters and subsequent cascading effects. On the other hand, automated systems do create new vulnerabilities and its use raises ethical concerns that would need to be taken into account in any research. Solutions and measures must take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data. Cost-benefit analysis not compromising ethics and privacy should also be considered.
Results achieved so far in the area of robots and autonomous systems (RAS), also under Horizon 2020, have led to applications making use of Unmanned Vehicles for example in the area of infrastructure maintenance and the detection and response to safety risks. Other concepts have been including self-healing materials, smart technologies and built-in tools as well as associated processes. For security incidents, there are so far less solutions available which would take into account the specific challenges of intentional disruptions as compared to accidents or material failure.

","23 November 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
An increased knowledge base on technology foresight, more accessible to the security stakeholders, that supports the consolidation of a forward-looking culture in the planning and use of resources in the area of security.
Anticipatory steering of the foreseeable evolution of security-relevant technologies and of the challenges and opportunities brought by such evolution on the industrialisation and use of future security technologies facilitated by a common foresight framework for EU civil security;
An evidence-based identification, prioritisation and programming of security R&I and capacity building investment sustained on an anticipated and consolidated view of how future technology, research and industrial trends impact, influence and shape future threats and security capabilities;
A recognised EU-wide definition of critical technological building blocks and components for the development of future high-priority capabilities;
Scope:
Anticipating the future, both in terms of threats and of opportunities offered by new emerging technologies is a real challenge. Having the capacity to depict plausible futures, to identify upcoming threats and to propose early responses can be of invaluable help to decision makers.
The sound programming of EU-funded security research can also be notably improved if the analytical capacity required to identify mid to long-term trends in the EU security context is in place and its outcomes are made available to decision makers through the right channels on a timely manner. This includes not only the identification of academic research, technology, innovation and industrial trends, but also of how these can be translated into early warning of threats and anticipated response. A common EU approach for civil security to address this need, properly covering the full range of security policy dimensions and acknowledging their particularities and distinctive features, is therefore needed.
Many organisations, including the European Commission, have developed instruments that provide timely assessment of technology trends on a regular basis. The broad technology landscape does not show frequent fluctuations, and a plethora of tools and ready-made information products unveiling trends in different time horizons are widely available. However, pure technology watch-based approaches are not helpful for civil security decision makers unless they are embedded in a qualitative assessment of threats and capabilities. Such assessment shifts the focus from a purely technological standpoint to the way in which these technologies are and will be used in a given policy, operational, industrial and societal context.
Therefore, building on existing technology and research landscaping mechanisms (and possibly tailoring them to the specificities of the civil security domain), applicants are invited to submit proposals for the development and operationalisation of a foresight framework for security including advanced tools, methods, techniques and processes. Such framework should be accompanied by a solid scientific model that connects future technologies with their future use. This should allow to identify how future civil security technology, research, innovation and industrial trends impact, influence and shape future threats and security capabilities, taking into account contextual aspects. These may include ethical, legal, societal, economic, geopolitical, environmental or industrial aspects, with particular emphasis on the capacity of the EU security technology and industrial base to achieve the desired technology development objectives, thus safeguarding the EU security technology sovereignty, if and when this is required. The proposed approach should combine qualitative and quantitative methods, maximise their automation and allow for qualified inputs through distributed and collaborative environment/schemes in order to make the most efficient and effective use of the human and technical resources available.
The proposals should take into account existing foresight approaches implemented by other EU and international organisations (e.g. JRC, EDA, INTERPOL, UNIDO, etc.). Should these be used as a reference, the newly proposed approaches should not just replicate the existing ones, but reference the source accordingly and adapt them to the context of EU civil security. Proposals should also take into account previous EU-funded research projects addressing foresight and build strong synergies with ongoing projects, in particular with the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes and the new Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 3.
The proposed foresight framework must be operationalised since the early stages of the project and deliver information products until its finalisation and beyond. When operationalising the proposed approach, applicants have to consider that they should deliver tangible value to the European Commission Strategic Foresight Agenda[1], supporting political priorities in the field of civil security, including the programming of the Union´s investment for the development of security capabilities through research and capacity building funds. Therefore, the results are expected to be made available at least to all stakeholders involved in this task, both at EU and national level. In order to allow that the developed foresight framework works with and for this purpose, the applicants should demonstrate that the working cycles proposed and the exchanges of information required are duly coordinated with the work of the Thematic Working Groups of the Community of Users for Secure, Safe and Resilient societies set-up by the European Commission (future CERIS –Community of European Research and Innovation for Security) and/or with equivalent innovation labs set-up by EU Agencies in the different thematic areas addressed (e.g. Frontex). Therefore, the thematic working groups should not only be a source of information, but also a validator of the foresight approach proposed and a beneficiary of the information products delivered.
Applicants must show a good understanding of the context where security research and capacity building programming takes place (mostly at EU level), of who are the main actors involved and of what are their needs in terms of foresight. The proposal should pay special attention to the type and format of the outcomes to be delivered, their timeliness and to what audience these are addressed. In this sense, outcomes must be delivered periodically every 6 months or less throughout the whole project starting from month 6.
The project has to identify and describe options for the exploitation of the foresight model proposed beyond the project lifetime, including the setting up of a permanent technology foresight capacity in support to EU-funded security research and innovation programming, i.e. under the Research-as-a-service approach.
The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 3 years.

During the course of the project, the applicants are expected to deliver clear evidence on a number of aspects in order to justify and de-risk a possible follow-up PCP action, including:
That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives;
That there is a consolidated group of potential buyers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint-procurement of innovative solutions;
That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who could be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project;
That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge;
That a future PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready on due time in order to launch the call for the acquisition of R&D services according to the PCP rules.
That the technology developments to be conducted in the future PCP can be done in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data.
That in developing technology solutions, societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) can be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner.

Improved and complete intelligence picture of security practitioners and policy-makers on drug production and trafficking, such as modus operandi, both offline and online, including the whole chain of trade, cross-border dimension, new trends, prevention of illicit drug market, new drugs, internet, including darknet, monitoring of drugs, financial flows of the related profits, etc.;
European Police and Border Guards Authorities benefit from better, modern and validated tools (including the lawful court-proof collection of crime evidence) and training materials to tackle criminal activities related to drugs, such as monitoring of internet, including darknet;
Enhanced ability of security practitioners to identify organised criminal groups involved in drug production and trafficking at an early stage;
Enhanced ability of security practitioners and policy-makers to prevent the emergence of organised crime networks related to drugs, and respond to the threat of existing organisations, while respecting fundamental rights;
Improved monitoring of dual-use chemicals used to drugs production;
European Police and Border Guards Authorities benefit from improved strategies of cooperation in fighting drug trafficking and dismantling related criminal networks;
Security policy makers are better supported in analysing the features of the drug trade and the business models underlying it, and the policy regulation related to the fight against drug production and trafficking is enhanced.
Scope:
Drug trafficking and drug production are the most profitable criminal activity of organised crime groups active in Europe. According to the 2019 EU Drug Markets Report, the total value of the retail market for illicit drugs in the EU was estimated at EUR 30 billion. There is a need for a comprehensive complete intelligence picture of this type of crime.
In the following, two main priorities in security research and innovation in this area are indicated. Firstly, innovative methods are needed to inquire into developments in the illicit drug market, especially on prevention and new drugs (their production, marketing and distribution). Secondly, internet, including darknet, monitoring as regards drugs has not been sufficiently addressed by innovative approaches until now. As stated by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), it is worth mentioning that over 100 global darknet markets are known to have existed for varying lengths of time since 2010 when the phenomenon emerged, that illicit drugs have been and continue to be the backbone of most darknet markets (drugs are important, but they share space with other illicit goods), and that two thirds of darknet markets content is known to be drug-related.
While vendor and customer interactions are relatively well studied and understood, there is a need for innovative approaches aimed at improving currently limited knowledge regarding the actors and mechanisms involved in this trade beyond the distribution/sales phase in the drug trafficking chain. Knowledge gaps also remain in relation to the extent of involvement of traditional organised crime in the darknet trade in illicit drugs. Then, gaps exist in the knowledge of the financial flows related to the profits from darknet market platforms.
Activities proposed within this topic should address both societal and technological dimensions of drug trafficking and drug production in a balanced way, taking care of the applicable legislation and fundamental rights. As the organised crime groups involved are practically fully interconnected, the international dimension should be analysed as well, hence both Police and Border Guards Authorities should be involved in the consortia, in order to tackle effectively all aspects of this crime, such as cross-border drugs smuggling.
Coordination with successful proposals under topic HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-08, HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-09, HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-10, HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-05 and HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-07 should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposed activities that could also link with security research for border management (e.g., border checks or detection of concealed objects) would be an asset. Due to the specific scope of this topic, in order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

Robust evidence used in cybersecurity decisions and tools
Better prediction of cybersecurity threats and related risks
Improved response capabilities based on effective collaboration and/or coordination with other relevant national or EU bodies in charge of Cybersecurity, including holistic incident reporting and enabling coordinated cyber-incident response.
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.
Scope:
Digital infrastructures together with their connected devices are characterised by complex interdependencies involving various physical and logical layers and connecting a wide range of legacy IT solutions and innovative technologies. Application scenarios include but are not limited to cybersecurity of communication systems and networks and their components, e.g. 5G networks, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, medical devices, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and their services, e.g. cloud-based ICT solutions. Their availability, controlled performance and reliability need to be guaranteed at every moment serving the needs, sometimes critical and safety-related e.g. in transportation, energy, healthcare, of millions of citizens, enterprises and society. Therefore, they need to be protected in real-time against ever-evolving cybersecurity threats.
Building on research and innovation in the area of cybersecurity of digital infrastructures for example projects funded from H2020 SU-DS01-2018[1], SU-DS04-2018-2020[2], SU-DS05-2018-2019[3] and SU-TDS-02-2018[4], state of the art technologies should support the logging, categorisation, data aggregation from different sources, automatic information extraction and analysis of cybersecurity incidents. This includes advanced methods for cyber threats intelligence and cyber-incident forensics enabling better prediction of cyber security threats. Proposals should develop and validate demonstration prototypes of tools and technologies to monitor and analyse cybersecurity incidents in an operational environment in line with the NIS directive and the General Data Protection Regulation. They should contribute to improved penetration testing methods and their automation by using machine learning and other AI technologies as appropriate. Moreover, proposals should support effective network traffic analysis applying detection techniques in network operations based on advanced security information management and threat intelligence. Proposed solutions should also include validation or piloting of cyber threat intelligence with early-stage detection, prediction and contributions towards response capability using predictive analytics, and as relevant, with efficient and user-friendly interaction methods, e.g. visual analytics. Furthermore, solutions deployed by this action should validate their approach to intrusion detection and incident monitoring with real end-users and their needs.
For expanding the proposed work in terms of additional pilot sites, additional user groups, additional applications, and complementary assessment of the acceptability of the use case, the actions may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Each consortium will define the selection process of the third parties for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50 000 to 300 000 per party). Up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.
A strong culture awareness of data protection should be fostered. The proposals should also appropriately address concerns about mass surveillance and protection of personal spaces. All technologies and tools developed should be appropriately documented, to support take-up and replicability.
Consortia should bring together interdisciplinary expertise and capacity covering the supply and the demand side. Participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.
Scope:
Trustworthy methodologies and tools for advanced analysis and verification, and dynamic testing of potentially vulnerable, insecure hardware and software components calls for good practices for system security, with a particular focus on software development tools, IT security metric and guidelines for secure products and services throughout their lifetime. A holistic methodology is needed, integrating runtime methods for monitoring and enforcement as well as design-time methods for static analysis and programme synthesis, which allows for the construction of secure systems with the strongest possible formal guarantees. The firmware of devices, implementations of communication protocols and stacks, Operating Systems (OSs), Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) supporting interoperability and connectivity of different services, device drivers, backend cloud and virtualisation software, as well as software implementing different service functionalities, are some examples of how software provides the essence of systems and smart (networked) objects. Supply chain issues, including integration of software and hardware, should be considered appropriately.
R&I will be funded to develop hybrid, agile and high-assurance tools capable of automating evaluation processes, accountability tools for audit results and updates and lightweight, isolated virtualisation environments capable of securely inspecting and orchestrating appliances in heterogeneous hardware and software architectures. Moreover, KPIs, metrics, procedures and tools for dynamic certification of implementation security and scalable security, from chip-level to software-level and service-level, should be developed. It may also include testing methods like coverage guided fuzzing as well as symbolic execution.

","16 November 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to at least three of the following expected outcomes:
Measuring, assessing and standardizing/certifying future-proof cryptography
Addressing gaps between the theoretical possibilities offered by quantum resistant cryptography and its practical implementations
Quantum resistant cryptographic primitives and protocols encompassed in security solutions
Solutions and methods that could be used to migrate from current cryptography towards future-proof cryptography
Preparedness for secure information exchange and processing in the advent of large-scale quantum attacks
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.
Scope:
During the next decades the European Union should seize the opportunities that quantum technologies will bring. However, quantum technologies will also pose a significant risk to the security of our society. The advent of large-scale quantum computers will compromise much of modern cryptography, which is instrumental in ensuring cybersecurity and privacy of the digital transition. Any cryptographic primitive based on the integer factorization and/or the discrete logarithm problems will be vulnerable to large-scale quantum-powered attacks. The digital data/products/systems that derive their security ultimately from the abovementioned primitives will be compromised and must be upgraded -including their replacement when needed- to quantum-resistant cryptography. The massive scale of this foreseen upgrade shows that preparations are needed today in order to widely implement the relevant mitigations in the future. Many companies and governments cannot afford to have their protected communications/data decrypted in the future, even if that future is a few decades away. There is a need to advance in the transition to quantum-resistant cryptography.
Applicants should propose approaches to tackle the abovementioned challenges, with the goal to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against attacks using both quantum or/and classical computers. Proposals may also try to better understand the expected capabilities of quantum computers (e.g. novel relevant quantum algorithms) and to further assess their implications to cybersecurity.
The proposed actions responding to this topic should take stock of and build on the relevant outcomes from other research fields (such as mathematics, physics, electrical engineering) and actions (e.g. H2020 projects, NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition, efforts in ETSI), and are encouraged to plan engaging and cooperating with them to the extent possible. Participation of SMEs is encouraged.
Applicants should demonstrate innovative ways to design, build, and deploy the new quantum-resistant infrastructures (including relevant hardware, software and IT processes). This should include switching from nowadays infrastructures to the proposed new ones with practical migration paths, aiming to efficiently manage the total time needed and the total costs associated, while also paying attention to affordable energy consumption.
Applicants should look at the implementation of quantum-resistant algorithms on software as well as specific hardware, such as. resource constrained IoT devices, smart cards, high-speed field-programmable gate arrays.
Proposals should devise, develop and validate metrics, methodologies, conformity assessment tests and tools for assessing and quantifying the security and the privacy of the proposed systems and services. Furthermore, proposals should strive to encompass a thorough comprehensive security evaluation of the engineering and deploying of efficient and secure implementations of the proposed solutions. Due consideration should be given to countermeasures against side channel attacks.
Applicants should strive to use the most promising relevant cryptographic primitives as well as to adapt the used cryptographic protocols accordingly.
Proposals may analyse how to develop combined quantum-classical[1] cryptographic solutions in Europe, for those use cases where these hybrid solutions might bring gains to the overall security. To this end, the analysis should take into account relevant actions in quantum cryptography (e.g. H2020 OpenQKD project, EuroQCI).
Proposals should validate their concept by exercising and deploying pilot demonstrators in relevant use cases. The demonstrators should include exercises on executing different migration strategies for real use cases and applications that would allow their implementation in large-scale, complex systems. Lessons learned from the exercises should be transformed into practical, multidisciplinary guidelines that support entities to plan and execute their own migration, considering the technical, the economical and legal contexts.
For expanding the proposed work in terms of including additional quantum-resistant infrastructures, additional pilot sites, additional countries and users the actions may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Each consortium will define the selection process of the third parties for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50 000 to 300 000 per party). Up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.

Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
Portable or easily deployable solutions used in customs inspections for detecting threat agents such as drugs, including new psychoactive substances;
Improved capacities of customs authorities to acquire, analyse, share drugs spectra, and detect new drugs in the context of customs inspections.
Scope:
Research will further develop capabilities for portable and quicker testing, analysis and detection of threats at customs checks sites. Example of target substances include drugs, with a focus on new psychoactive substances, but also gems or precious metals and other threats or illicit goods.
These capabilities would allow customs to deploy detection capacity where and when more appropriate and efficient and to carry out inspections “on the move” and more quickly. This would allow detection of threats in the flow of goods directly at the customs inspection site, without having to divert the scanned object(s) to a different site, like a more distant dedicated detection laboratory. This would provide better response capability for customs in an ever-changing operational environment. It would allow for a faster detection and verification capability in the field.
The improved capability includes being able to update more easily and quickly the references for the target goods and substances, and to be able to detect them. This includes updated spectra of drugs such as new psychoactive substances, which would allow detecting them. There is room for innovation to improve customs’ access to updated spectra of substances when they appear; to make spectra easily available to customs’ devices; and to improve data for spectra libraries.
This technology will also allow for an automatic collection of relevant data on the conditions and outcomes of the controls, as to allow measuring the efficiency of the measures and feeding the analysis for risk management and security at the borders.
The involvement of police authorities is encouraged, as well as synergies with relevant topics of the Fight against Crime and Terrorism Destination, to ensure operational scenarios are best identified for detection capabilities by customs. Research projects should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but is not limited to research by other Framework Programmes projects.
Testing and validation, within the project, of developed tools and solutions in an operational environment, will be an asset. Proposals should be convincing in explaining the methods they intend to use for demonstrating, testing and validating the proposed tools and solutions.

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Qualitative and quantitative analyses on the behaviour of diverse society groups affected by a natural and man-made disaster or crisis situation, during and after an even occurs, based on real cases and testimonies, lessons learned from past disasters or crisis and recommendations from citizens and local authorities. Examine how this analysis could be integrated into preparedness plans and processes to include cultural, historical, and ethical perspectives on what defines disasters and how they are responded to.
Analyses of human behaviour as triggering or cascading factors of disasters or crisis situations, and transformation of qualitative data into quantitative information to improve vulnerability and exposure analyses.
Development of community-centred (vis-à-vis victim- or patient-centred) approaches and corresponding preparedness plans: in view of limited emergency response capacities and threat of systems collapses (e.g. health system, food distribution, supply chains) in large-scale disaster scenarios, analyse what community practices and communication strategies can help mitigate the latter and enable the public to be a capable partner in emergency planning and response.
Specific measures to better address the needs and requirements of most vulnerable groups (chronic suffers, persons with disabilities, children, elderly persons, economically and social deprived persons, refugees and irregular migrants in emergency planning and recovery measures.
Analyses of the nature and scope of mental health issues of the affected populations and of first-responders arising during and following natural or man-made disasters or crisis situations and their implications for response and recovery, and options to address these issues, including through social and health services such as emergency psycho-social support.
Analyses of mechanisms and factors that can lead to false alarms and misdirected actions, and of the direct consequences on both population and decision-makers.
Scope:
Human actions and behaviour may strongly influence the effects and dynamics of a disaster or crisis situation and on the response, potentially modifying the vulnerability of the population. For example, inadequate design of technological systems may favour cascading consequences due to limited consideration of human performance, and insufficient planning. Linked to this, due to extreme time pressure, crisis managers are often forced to make decisions on the basis of inadequate information. The behaviour of the general public, mostly influenced by demographic factors (e.g. gender, age, income, education, risk-tolerance, social connectivity etc.) and the perception of risks, depends on the availability, form and access to information about the crisis and management of trade-offs (e.g. efficiency and thoroughness trade-offs). Social media play an important role here being a means of disinformation and misinformation.
Recent disasters related either to natural causes (including climate-related and geological hazards), man-made causes (including industrial accidents or terrorist attacks) or the COVID-19 pandemic crisis have shown the lack of sufficient knowledge in the way citizens react in case of disasters or crisis situations, with implications on policy design and implementation for example in the form of preparedness plans. In this respect, taking into account the knowledge gathered by projects funded in Horizon 2020 and ensuring complementarity, behavioural and psychological research on how citizens behave in the event of a disaster or crisis situation is needed to better understand how to best raise awareness in the population and develop tools to facilitate this.
It is hence necessary to better investigate how historical, cultural and emotional factors (e.g. anxiety, panic etc.) during a disaster or a crisis influence rational actions, evaluations of options and information seeking. In addition, the impact of disasters on health also requires looking into the short and long-term consequences of exposure to high stress/threat levels bears, in particular for mental health.
Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events."

Adjustments of warning and response systems in the light of cross-disciplinary cooperation, involving planning authorities and first responders, to better manage the rapid deployment of first responders and communication to citizens in vulnerable areas in the case of extreme climate events or geological disasters.
Timely operational forecasts of severe (short-term focus) extreme weather events (e.g. floods, hot waves, storms, storm surges) or geological hazards (e.g. volcanic eruption, earthquake, tsunami) to aid planning authorities, civil protection agencies and first responders in their decision-making.
European-scale multi-hazard platform to facilitate the identification of expected natural hazards with great specificity in time and space and improve science communication for boosting interactions between scientists, general media and the public.
Methodologies to integrate innovative state-of-the art early warning systems into existing tools for decision-making and situation reporting already used by civil protection authorities from international to local level.
Scope:
Enhanced risk and crisis assessment and preparedness to natural hazards rely on tools using different types of data, information and forecasts (e.g. meteorological data, physical data related to geohazards and climate projections etc.) which may enable to anticipate the occurrence of disasters. Based on the legacy of existing solutions, in particular in the area of extreme weather events, further developments are required to compare impact forecasting and early warning approaches at international level. The aim of such comparisons would be to design EU-wide decision-support and information systems supporting planning authorities and civil protection agencies in the rapid deployment of first responders and communication to citizens in vulnerable areas in the case of extreme climate events or geological disasters. This platform development might be prone to international cooperation, hence supporting the implementation of both EU policies and the UN Sendai Framework for Action. Innovation actions should improve measures and technologies that are needed to better plan for extreme climate events and geological disasters, reduce risks, as well as manage the immediate consequences of natural disasters, in particular regarding emergency responses. This should lead to sound and timely operational forecasts of severe (short-term focus) extreme weather events or geological hazards to aid planning authorities, civil protection agencies and first responders in their decision-making. Built up on developments from relevant H2020 projects, a European-scale multi-hazard platform should be designed, taking into account existing developments at EU level and available space information, in order to facilitate the identification of expected natural hazards with great specificity in time and space. The aim is to utilise largely existing capabilities and combine them into a single, user-friendly platform.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with vulnerable countries, e.g. African and South Mediterranean members of the Union for the Mediterranean.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Evaluation of Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) needs in areas not prone to systematic quality checks prior to decision-making in the natural hazards and CBRN-E areas, for physical, chemical and biological parameters.
Based on past experience, organised intercomparisons among laboratories and institutes at EU level which are in charge of providing data for risk- and evidence-based decision-making in order to evaluate the comparability of data produced worldwide.
Production of reference materials and possible certification schemes for the systematic checking of laboratory and method’s performance for monitoring data used in risk- and evidence-based decision-making that are not prone to readily established schemes.
Scope:
Risk management of natural hazards and CBRN-E events closely rely on available data, taking into account uncertainties brought on by climate change and Earth dynamics. The soundness of decisions is based on quality data, which justifies that continuous efforts are made to improve their quality assurance / quality control, in particular in the natural hazards area as well as in the CBRN-E area. In many instances, measurement data used in decision-making are rarely challenged in the areas of crisis management and/or mechanisms are still underdeveloped to systematically demonstrate their quality (e.g. in the case of substances of criminal nature such as biological toxins). Quality assurance / Quality control (QA/QC) are prone to standardised procedures such as the EN 45000 Series, which includes requirements related to laboratory settings, analytical techniques, criteria for analytical performances (e.g. accuracy, repeatability, limits of detection etc.) that are well implemented in sectors such as the environment (including water), food and health. In other areas requiring monitoring data of physical, chemical or biological nature related to risk assessment of natural hazards such as climate threats and pandemics, man-made (accidental) risks (e.g. chemical substances in Seveso-type environments) or terrorism threats (e.g. chemical or biological toxins used for criminal purposes), the QA/QC rules are much less known and followed. In particular, the systematic comparison of measurement techniques related to risk assessment of natural hazards (including health) and CBRN-E data is not wide-spread and references data or materials are often lacking. Recent developments have led to the testing of proficiency testing schemes for biological toxins of potential bioterrorism risk, but a general framework for checking data quality and controlling laboratory and analytical technique performances (including from measurement data directly gathered in the field) does not yet exist at European level. There is hence a need to evaluate the needs for QA/QC developments in relevant areas for which physical, chemical and biological measurement data are insufficiently checked for quality, and to develop an appropriate EU-wide approach to improve and demonstrate this quality, thus ensuring a traceability and comparability of data used throughout Europe for sound risk- and evidence-based decision-making.

Innovative financial instruments and IT-solutions to reduce transaction costs for disaster risk finance and insurance products (e.g. earth observation data, artificial intelligence, financial technologies)
Research and testing of novel European, cross-border, national and regional disaster risk financing frameworks. This needs to involve a wide range of stakeholders (e.g. disaster risk management, finance, communication) from public and private sectors.
Risk model development for future natural catastrophe events, development of European stress-testing scenarios including vulnerable hotspots and uninsurable risks.
Scope:
Natural disasters (weather and climate related extremes and geological events) in the EU have cost on average EUR 17 billion per year the past ten years. Around 35 % of the total losses from climate and extreme and weather events are insured today in the EU, although the proportion of the insured losses ranges from 1 % in Romania and Lithuania to about 60 % in Belgium. In the near-term future, the European insurance industry and their regulators have warned that affordability and insurability are likely to become an increasing concern with climate change. Insurance, in combination with other risk transfer and financing mechanisms, is an important tool to achieve disaster risk reduction targets. Insurance plays an important role in financially supporting the recovery of individuals, organisations, businesses and communities affected by natural disasters. Large disaster losses in recent years have led insurance companies to re-examine their approach to increase the extent of insurance coverage and compensation for loss in vulnerable areas. This includes increasing their investment in assessing and modelling risk, developing advice on risk prevention and establishing new forms of coverage to support governments in managing the costs they face in post-disaster recovery. Questions remain about the limits of insurance in tackling fast-rising threats - not only how people at highest risk and with lower incomes can afford it, but whether insurance models can cope with much more frequent and destructive. Rethinking insurance pay-outs, giving homeowners clearer information on potential risks - using simple online tools, or providing data at the time of house purchases - may also be the way forward more resilient communities.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Achieving the objectives of the Circular Economy Action Plan by enabling second life of batteries and increasing rates for recycling and recovery, in line with upcoming regulatory requirements.
Revolutionize and re-freshen recycling industry, by applying best-in-world innovations based on automatisation, efficiency and sustainability.
Create new circular business models, such as second life, to reduce the need for primary raw materials, and to maximize the use of battery cells reducing the cost per cycle.
Develop a community for actors involved in the management of the recycling value chain for batteries (including second life) for sharing best practices (health and safety, transport, dismantling, refurbishing, recycling).
Improve safety, through automatisation and reducing accidents.
Scope:
Today the amount of end-of-life (EoL) batteries from e-mobility and stationary applications is still limited. Moreover, EoL batteries are not standardised (form, chemical composition, etc.) and consequently, their management and recycling are mainly based on manual process. This increases risk of accidents as the integrity of the batteries / cells is no longer guaranteed.
Within next several years, the amount of EoL batteries will surge, transforming the recycling and battery value chain in general. It is important to develop efficient recycling chain and processes able to meet these upcoming amounts of diversified waste streams. A general approach to recycling should thus be reconsidered and new sustainable recycling chain for batteries should be established, in terms of introducing novel approaches to products, processes and keeping in mind their socio-economic viability and environmental impact.
It will require new upscaleable techniques and concepts for collection, logistics, and automatisation in sorting, dismantling and second use before recycling.
Proposals are expected to cover all aspects below:
Development of standardized common diagnostics protocols and cut-off criteria between product (2nd life application) and waste (recycling).
Elaborate critical stage of diagnosis of batteries as a waste-prevention measure in order to define which batteries or components of batteries are still considered fit for a second life application.
Automate the dismantling of E-mobility and stationary batteries, reducing costs by avoiding manual work and improving sorting of parts for their replacement or preparation for recycling allowing the selective extraction of materials including the cathode and anode materials which for certain Li-chemistries lead to a higher value creation for the downstream recyclers.
Development of novel safe dismantling processes and safety procedures along all steps of EoL management chain with focus on battery burning process (thermal runaway), identification of Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) and Lower Explosive Limits (LEL).
Development of technologies preventing or reducing thermal runaway during transportation, storage and dismantling of batteries.
Design and demonstration of standardized and cost-efficient storage and transportation containers with visual and thermal load monitoring systems and, if necessary, inert atmosphere or other measures reducing risk of fire or thermal runaway.
Development of technologies for fast and efficient discharge of used batteries, connected with energy recovery, possibly integrated with SoH diagnostic equipment, with flexible connectivity and adjustable to various kinds of batteries.
Development of standardized battery labelling system enabling all interested parties to automatically obtain necessary data on each battery. Potential integration of labelling system with battery passport database project and with labelling systems from other regions of the world (e.g. China). Identification of necessary data that should be included into labelling and battery passport projects.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Improved European common investigation capabilities thanks to modern, robust, validated and reliable solutions, used by forensic institutes and Police Authorities for analysing complex crime scenes with various types of trace evidence items;
Shorter court case thanks to the availability of more solid forensic (cross-border) evidence that is acceptable in court, respecting fair trial requirements;
Common European approaches are made available to policy-makers and security practitioners for analysing risks/threats, and identifying and deploying relevant security measures while inspecting, gathering and analysing trace substances collected in complex crime scenes, which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, the traceability of forensic evidence, cost-benefit considerations, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data;
Improved shaping and tuning by security policy-makers of regulation on using innovative solutions in crime scene investigations by forensic institutes and Police Authorities;
Improved understanding of the underlying phenomena governing the transfer of material from a surface to another, persistence of material once transferred, recovery process of the material as well as characterisation and expectations regarding the background noise;
Ground truth datasets accessible to the scientific community to support interpretation at the activity level of transfer of microtraces, biological traces, biometric traces and chemical traces;
Enhanced evidence collection on crime scene due to an increased use of novel technologies;
Police Authorities and forensic institutes are provided with innovative methods of biological fluid identification for forensic applications;
Forensic practitioners and Police Authorities active in crime scene investigations are provided with modern and innovative training curricula.
Scope:
Nowadays, Police Authorities deal with a growing complexity of crime scenes containing various types of trace evidence items that can also present safety hazards for the forensic experts and crime scene investigators. Traditional forensic crime scene analysis typically involves several techniques to inspect, gather and analyse collected trace substances. There is a need to improve these processes and make them more accurate, effective and sensitive in such a complex scenario, by employing modern approaches, for instance (but not limited to) nanotechnology, next generation sequencing or Artificial Intelligence.
A way to modernise forensic science for the professionalisation of crime scene investigations is through improving the understanding of the underlying phenomena governing the transfer of material from a surface to another, persistence of material once transferred, recovery process of the material as well as characterisation and expectations regarding the background noise.
Regarding transfer, persistence and background abundance, two different types of developments are needed: 1) of ground truth datasets accessible to the scientific community to support interpretation at the activity level for transfer of microtraces (paint, glass, soil), biological traces (body fluids, DNA), biometric traces (fingermarks, shoemarks), chemical traces (drugs, explosives, ignitable liquids); and 2) of methods of biological fluid (blood, semen, saliva, urine, etc.) identification for advanced forensic applications. The proposed activities should take into account the European dimension regarding harmonisation of the approach and cross-border acceptance of the collected evidence. A special attention has to be given to applicable legislation, ethics and fundamental rights, as well as to the well-documented use of scientific method to enhance transparency in the establishing of forensic evidence. The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting with one or more Police Authorities and other relevant authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. – to be developed by the project.
Coordination with successful proposals under topic SU-AI02-2020 (on AI research datasets), HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-04 (on ground-truth data sets for conventional forensics) and HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-02 (on common data formats) should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Cooperation with the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) is welcome.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Improved real-time detection, tracking and analysis of different situations, incidents and risks (including the location and well-being of first responders)
More targeted actionable intelligence and more efficient command operations due to the fast analysis of different information sources
Enhanced European and global interoperability for different types of first responders (e.g. firefighters, medical responders, police, civil protection)
Availability of first responder solutions that are oriented on internationally defined requirements and recognised practices, and thus can be used with different national systems and equipment
Scope:
International cooperation is key to respond to different kind of natural and man-made disasters, as well as intentional security threats. Besides operational cooperation, there is a need to find a common understanding on what innovation is needed to able to respond to different challenges. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 list the need ‘to strengthen technical and logistical capacities to ensure better response to emergencies’[1]as one priority for national and local levels. Such capacities depend to a large extent on the effectiveness and the specific capabilities of organisations responsible for first response to incidents.
In order to perform their dangerous tasks, First Responders require the best possible equipment that is tailor-made for extreme scenarios. As such, tools and gear need to be highly specialised and adapted to the different specific first responder needs. The market for such equipment is however fragmented, limiting the availability and affordability.
International cooperation to define common requirements has helped to create a clearer picture on what gaps remain and cannot be satisfied by existing solutions, thus requiring targeted research. Global capability gaps have been identified by international expert groups such as the UNDRR Scientific and Technical Advisory Group and the International Forum to Advance First Responder Innovation (IFAFRI), involving scientific experts, firefighters, medical responders and police officers from several EU and non-EU countries.
Proposals under this topic are invited to address one or several of the following capability gaps that were identified by national first responders within IFAFRI:
The ability to know the location of responders and their proximity to risks and hazard in real time
The ability to detect, monitor, and analyse passive and active threats and hazards at incident scenes in real time
The ability to monitor the physiological signs of emergency responders
The ability to incorporate information from multiple and non-traditional sources into incident command operations
The ability ty to create actionable intelligence based on data and information from multiple sources
Proposed solutions should take into account the different specifications as defined within IFAFRI, most notably the Gap Analysis, Statement of Objectives and Deep Dive Analysis[2] and propose solutions (to the extent possible) that are suitable for different types of responders.
Proposals can be submitted by any eligible organisation and do not necessarily require the cooperation with co-applicants from an IFAFRI member country.[3] Participation from non-associated third countries (including the non-EU IFAFRI partners) is however encouraged and the participation of at least 2 first responders’ organisations from at least 2 different non-EU countries is strongly encouraged.
Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.

Development of tools and technologies, including novel multiplatform CBRN-E systems, to enhance situational awareness to prepare for and rapidly react to CBRN-E events both for responders on the ground as well as for dispatch and crisis centres, especially in urban areas.
Support of first responders’ situational awareness via high level processing solution, e.g. based on dispersion modelling or threat recognition / prediction solution using sensor data fusion and algorithms that combine heterogeneous sensor data in order to reduce the likelihood of false alarms and contribute to an improved decision-making process for the responders.
Development of fast, reliable and portable devices for responders to perform an in-situ provisional identification of CBRN-E suspicious samples, enabling to decide which personal protective equipment (PPE) is required for first responders, including smart wearable equipment.
Solutions integrating different commercial and experimental sensors/platforms, which should improve the state-of-the-art products in terms of communication (e.g. by using novel and open communication protocols, pre-processing of data), power consumption (e.g. by offering supplemental power source to the existing sensors), interfacing capability (e.g. by proposing an open interface specification). The proposals should also cover the system transportability, online capability and continuous operation issues.
Scope:
Addressing first responders’ needs requires innovative actions resulting in technological, institutional and capacity-building solutions that are tailored to the risks, affordable, accepted by citizens, and customised and implemented for the (cross-sectoral) needs of practitioners. Innovative solutions are required to enable first responders to get a faster overview of any disaster situation based on the knowledge of past events and prevention actions. Complementing this, novel technologies and tools are necessary to enhance situational awareness in the case of disaster-prone events or health-related crises, especially in the case of cross-border situations, in order for first responders to be better prepared in emergency operations. In this context, innovative technologies are required for first responders to rapidly identify hazardous agents and contaminants such as CBRN-E substances in case of an accident, outbreak/pandemics or terrorist attack and act more efficiently and rapidly regarding communication. This requires novel rapid and accurate detection of substances (possibly coupled with unmanned vehicles or drones) and on-line communication systems to support first responders’ operations and to provide the ability to conduct on-scene operations remotely without endangering them. Needs cover a broad range of technologies on top of existing CBRN-E detectors, e.g. samplers, separation systems, dilution or sample pre-concentrators etc., multiplying their capabilities. Advancements should take into consideration power consumption of front-end technology, as well as, transportability, on-line, dynamic sampling, automation, smart samplers, sample preparation, integration with detectors, standardisation. A focus should be made on experimental or commercial systems that are not optimised in terms of online, continuous measurements, power consumption and hyphenation. Other areas of research closely depending upon enhanced situational awareness and preparedness concern decisions related to the protection of first responders (e.g. advanced protective gear and smart wearable equipment), in particular in case of CBRN-related events (infectious diseases, accidental or linked to terrorism), and ways to minimise their time-to-react in urban areas or to conduct on-scene operations remotely without endangering responders (e.g. ways through traffic, UAVs etc.).
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan in the framework of the EU-Japan collaboration.
Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.

","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
For graphite, both natural and synthetic graphite production for the EV market take place almost exclusively in China. Although there is some existing mining of Natural graphite in Europe, scaling these sources for the active anode material needs within Europe will be very challenging as (i) extensive graphite exploration and mining would be needed[1], and (ii) almost all of the refining capacity is based in China. The main challenges in refining are low yield in the spheronisation and the use of large amounts of hydrofluoric acid in the refining step.
For synthetic graphite, by-products of oil distillation are used as the starting point, followed by calcining, milling, shaping and graphitisation. This process produces high quality anode graphite (enabling long lifetimes and fast charging) but is energy intensive and causes environmental emissions (CO2, PAH). Opportunities to overcome all these problems exist already in Europe but need further development and investment to reach the required scale.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes on either natural or synthetic graphite production respectively:
Decreased dependency of Europe on imported battery grade graphite and decreased risk in European Battery supply chains.
Graphite (both natural and synthetic) competitively produced and refined in Europe in a sustainable and socially acceptable way improving the competitiveness of European batteries.
Graphite leveraging the potential for fast charging of batteries, one of the key factors for the user acceptance of electric vehicles.
Reduced carbon and environmental emissions from the anode material supply chain.
Projects should contribute to European Raw Materials Alliance objectives.
The Synthetic graphite projects are expected to focus additionally on:
System prototype demonstration of battery grade anode graphite material with high energy density, long lifetime and quality enabling fast charging, produced with increased yield and lower environmental footprint.
As a longer-term option, biocarbon alternatives to petroleum coke are expected to be developed to ensure long term sustainable supply.
The Natural graphite projects are expected to focus additionally on:
Advanced refining of Natural graphite to improve the yield of battery grade products and lower the environmental footprint.
Scope:
Enabling European graphite production – with vertical integration into the European battery production. Resource efficient sustainable production of both synthetic and natural graphite emphasising reduction of energy consumption, CO2 emissions, chemical use and the optimisation of recovery yield and raw material consumption. Enhance versatility regarding products and usable primary/secondary raw materials.
Development of solutions for combined use of natural and synthetic graphite.
For natural graphite: improving purification, milling, shaping and coating technologies that improve the performance characteristics of natural graphite.
Improving the yield of spheronised products from natural graphite concentrate.
Development of a non-HF purification technology to produce battery-grade anode material from spheronised natural graphite.
Developing improved coating technologies for natural graphite that will increase the performance characteristics of natural compared to synthetic.

State-of-the-art in experimental and computational techniques for characterisation of battery materials and interfaces are targeting the scale of the atoms and ions. There is still a lack of understanding hampering the engineering of new and emerging battery technologies,, due to the complexity of interface formation and evolution as a function of time, temperature, battery cycling conditions and chemical composition of the electrolytes consisting of different salts, additives and liquid solvents and/or solid components,. Going into more depth, at process level, the time and the length scale of the electron transfer reactions remain almost completely underexplored.
Pushing the frontiers of present in situ analytical techniques is a must to more efficiently pursue research on sustainable materials and to develop greener Li-ion as well as future battery chemistries. Improvements in analytical techniques that would allow to follow the movement of interfacial reactions at the molecular scale all the way to the role of electrons at the nanoscale and sub-nanoscale, at relevant timescales and on relevant systems and interfaces, will have great impact beyond the sole battery field and would benefit to the electrochemistry field as a whole, including electrocatalysis and others. It will contribute to open up a new era for the study of transport at interfaces, which remains one of the greatest challenges of research for any electrochemist. For researchers exploring new storage concepts and engineering new interfaces, it will also provide insight into how to control the movement and redox processes of atoms. It can lead to an increased control of the electronic wiring of electrodes and a deeper understanding of the redistribution of electronic charge during redox processes.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
New methods for studying electrode/electrolyte interfaces for liquid-based electrolytes and batteries and for studying solid-state and buried interfaces.
Models for explaining the degradation of battery interfaces.
Deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of battery interfaces, leading to new insights on how to increase the lifetime and safety of new and emerging battery technologies, and therefore contributing to the long-term competitiveness of the European battery industry.
Scope:
This topic should support the development of novel experimental and computational techniques targeting the time and length scales of interface reactions in a battery cell including electron and ion localisation, mobility and transfer reactions.
This targets the development of novel analytical techniques, supported by modelling and simulation, able to follow interface, electron and ion dynamics in battery materials and battery cells, and carefully selecting controlled model systems to implement those novel techniques.
Examples of experimental tools include operando Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), operando ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy techniques, operando X-ray scattering techniques, NMR, soft X-ray spectroscopy with RIXS, neutron spectroscopy, ultra-fast spectroscopic methods as well as Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities. Other synchrotron and neutron scattering and ion-beam techniques leading to development of new understanding of interfaces can also to be suggested and implemented. The goal is to give advice and new insights on how to increase the life time and safety of new emerging technologies.
Building upon the BATTERY 2030+: this call topic addresses the need of increasing the fundamental understanding of processes in batteries at a level that will accelerate the development of more stable chemistries adapted for their specific purpose. The proposal should also cover the contribution and collaboration to the BATTERY 2030+ large scale initiative.

","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Batteries have complex and dynamic processes taking place in and between materials and at the interfaces/interphases within a battery cell. For each new battery chemistry explored, new challenges in understanding these processes are revealed. To accelerate the finding of new material’s and their combinations for both existing and future battery chemistries the iterative and fragmented trial and error approach used today needs to be replaced since it is slow and insufficient.
To accelerate the discovery of battery interfaces, materials and new sustainable concepts with high energy and/or power performance there is a need to develop a fully autonomous and chemistry neutral Materials Acceleration Platform (MAP) for battery materials and interfaces. This is a key and long-term challenge for European battery community. The aim is to integrate advanced multi-scale computational modelling, materials synthesis, characterisation and testing to perform closed-loop autonomous materials findings and interphase engineering that would accelerate by at least a factor of five the discovery of new battery chemistries with ultra-high performances.
Building upon the shared data infrastructure, standards and protocols developed in the BATTERY 2030+ initiative, this call topic addresses the need of increasing the level of autonomy in the MAP-based discovery and development process. The proposal should also cover the contribution and collaboration to the BATTERY 2030+ large scale initiative.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes
Develop new tools and methods for significantly accelerating the development and optimisation of battery materials and interfaces, in order to increase the competitiveness of the battery material and cell industry in Europe.
Demonstrate a fully autonomous battery-MAP capable of integrating computational modelling, materials synthesis and characterisation of both Li-ion and beyond Li-ion chemistries.
Scale-bridging, multi-scale battery interface models capable of integrating data from embedded sensors in the discovery and prediction process, e.g. to orchestrate proactive self-healing.
Community wide state-of-the-art collaborative environment to access data and utilise automated workflows for integrated simulations and experiments on heterogeneous sites, e.g., exploiting European HPC architectures and Large-scale facilities in collaboration with LENS and LEAPS.
Demonstrate a robotic system that is capable of material synthesis for inorganic, organic or hybrid compounds following standard synthesis routes via automated characterisation of intermediate and final products and autonomous decision-making.
Deploy predictive hybrid physics- and data-driven models for the spatio-temporal evolution of battery interfaces and demonstrate inverse design of a battery material/interface.
Scope:
Infrastructure tools for secure remote data access, data analysis and predictive modelling: Develop a FAIR[1] data infrastructure for raw and curated experimental and modelling data, which can be accessed remotely and securely by relevant stakeholders, including industry. Develop the software infrastructure required to operate this platform, also with regard to future reproducibility and further exploitation of the results of the research activities. The software should provide specific access right and allow remote data access, complemented by distributed workflows using software-agnostic workflow engines that provide rapid-prototyping. Inverse materials design using hybrid physics- and data-driven battery interface genome models should also be demonstrated.
Automated high throughput characterisation and integrated experimental and computational workflows: High throughput, multimodal operando experimental techniques using standardised battery cells and established protocols should be optimised to perform effective screening of new materials and on-line diagnosis of realistic devices. A central objective is to establish, structure, operate and dynamically refine such facility platform to harmonise, mutualise and optimise the global demand for battery characterisation. This includes automated experimental and computational workflows and modules for data acquisition and multimodal/multiscale analysis. Particular attention should be paid to battery interfaces and direct observation of interfaces under dynamic conditions, which are key to improve the performances and the lifetime of batteries.
Autonomous synthesis robotics and orchestration software: The transition from low/no automated robotics for the synthesis of battery materials requires several R&I steps towards fully autonomous systems. Within the scope of this proposed call are partially autonomous systems following standard synthesis routes for inorganic and organic battery materials, especially also multi-step and high-temperature synthesis, that so far are challenging to automate for high throughput. AI-based orchestration and optimisation software modules and packages specifically targeting battery materials and interfaces are also central to the scope.
Inverse design and AI-assisted scale-bridging models for multiple time- and length-scale processes: To develop scale-bridging models correctly describing the multiple mechanisms occurring at atomistic scale and the mesoscopic scale on the cell level. The new model approaches should be able to incorporate data from the advanced sensing in virtual design optimisation and battery control algorithms for SoX estimation. Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of the developed SoX models is also a requirement to assess the robustness of the developed models. These models should achieve a challenge based rational balance of accuracy and computational effort. They should accurately describe the actual state of the system, but also enable diagnosis and prediction, e.g., when self-healing procedures should be initiated. Multiscale Modelling approaches should be developed for the control of safety between BOL (Beginning Of Life) and EOL (End of Life) of a battery system by different uses and diagnosing the safety state of a battery system by innovative methods.

Validate the technical feasibility of industrial heat upgrade systems capable of supplying various industrial processes with useful heat in the (sink) temperature range of 150 – 250 °C from renewable heat sources (e.g. solar thermal), ambient heat or industrial waste heat.
Development and demonstration at pilot scale (5 – 200 kWth).
Better awareness of the challenges and benefits of heat upgrade in the relevant industrial sectors.
Scope:
This topic aims to satisfy the need for low-medium temperature heat in the relevant industrial sectors, by upgrading lower temperature heat flows, including from renewable heat sources, ambient heat or industrial excess (waste) heat, as a cost-efficient way to improve energy efficiency and reduce the GHG emissions.
Available heat upgrade technologies, such as for example heat pumps, are limited to supply (sink) temperatures of 150°C. Innovative heat upgrade technologies have the potential to extend the temperature range up to 250°C, which would allow to cover more industrial applications.
In order to reach this goal all the following development areas need to be covered:
Identify the target industrial processes which would benefit from this higher temperature heat upgrade technology, as excess (waste) heat sources and as users (heat sinks); make a preliminary assessment of the potential impacts of these industrial applications in terms of energy savings and GHG and air pollutant emissions reductions in the EU (and Associated States, if data are available), so as to maximise the impact and coverage of the most promising applications in the subsequent development step; estimate by extrapolation the benefits at global level.

Optimise the technical performances in terms of: temperature increase between sink inlet and sink outlet temperatures; temperature spread between source and sink temperatures; flexibility to source input temperature variations; higher sink thermal power potential; higher coefficient of performance.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Freight transport and logistics companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, evolve to operate seamlessly engaging with nodes, partners and customers in an effective way, thus achieving a better utilisation of the assets and other resources in the freight transport and logistics chain within Europe.
Energy and emissions reduction potentials higher than 20%, based on the operative gains without needing to renew the assets, are demonstrated by the shared logistics networks (collaborative logistics).
Scope:
Integration and harmonisation of closed independent logistics networks and of clusters of networks (e.g. from different logistics service providers or different cargo owners) providing open and shared services to manufacturers and retailers focussing on intra-European flows, would enable to optimise freight flows at system level, thus overcoming operational inefficiencies (e.g. peak overloads, partially loaded or empty transportation, sub-optimal transit routing, waiting times, higher overall costs, inefficient asset utilisation, increased emissions) and driving climate neutrality in logistics.
Projects will have to advance the adoption of technological solutions and organisational and behavioural models in use cases and applications under the leadership of logistics operators taking into account stakeholders’ preferences.
In pilot actions, two or more logistics providers or shippers’ logistics networks should develop and demonstrate a systemic framework for connecting effectively their independent logistics networks (at least partially) pooling the demand of various cargo owners and develop a system of logistics networks in which assets and services, including synchro-modal services, are shared and flows are managed in a consolidated way demonstrating potential benefits. Proposals should address all the following points and subpoints:
Develop and demonstrate a robust and transparent collaborative framework with guiding principles to ensure operational connectivity of logistics networks (e.g. services, shared resources and assets, information and financial flows, etc.) under the lead of logistics providers and addressing governance and potential anti-competition law issues. Current independent closed networks gradually are expected to become connected networks with shared and open capabilities, including intermodal transport solutions in specific demonstrators.
Through the pilot cases and demonstrators:
Identify and demonstrate potential gains of these logistics networks / systems of logistics networks compared to independent logistics networks in terms of emissions and energy consumption reduction and potential business models for uptake beyond the project duration.
Identify main barriers and opportunities to achieve a system of logistics networks, propose solutions and pilot them to deliver guidelines for expansion and implementation.
Address governance aspects (e.g. how to organise and expand the logistic network with other logistics networks willing to join or how to legally engage with users of these shared logistics networks services and capabilities) and propose actions to accelerate organic and jointly acceptable growth of these logistics networks.
Identify innovative business models addressing also revenue sharing.
Identify and assess existing regulation (e.g. anti-competition) preventing or the need for new regulation to enable this shared and holistic approach, by building on the results and outcomes of previous and ongoing projects and activities[1]. Develop guidelines to address specific concerns and propose specific recommendations that should be considered.
Identify and assess the main drivers and barriers towards horizontal collaboration in terms of organisational cultures and frameworks of the logistics service providers and the transport operators. Propose solutions to overcome the barriers and recommendations on how to create the best conditions (success factors) to boost new logistics collaborations, maintain them and reap their benefits.

Project results are expected to contribute to at least four of the following expected outcomes:
Improved multimodal transport network and traffic management capabilities, facilitating seamless door-to-door mobility for passengers and freight.
Effective and resilient network-wide data exchange and new integrated data management systems for dynamic and responsive multimodal network and traffic management.
Tested and validated systems for enhanced prediction and resolution of network bottlenecks, substantially increasing safety, security, resilience and overall performance of the entire transport network.
Innovative tools and services for optimising mobility flows of passengers and freight in cities and other operating environments, cutting congestion, journey times and traffic jams across transport modes, and thereby significantly reducing emissions (CO2, SOx, NOx, particles, noise).
New governance arrangements for multimodal transport network and traffic management, in view of further regulatory and policy actions.
High market adoption and transferability of innovations to different ecosystems.
Scope:
Advanced multimodal network and traffic management capabilities are essential for the efficient operation of the entire transport network and for seamless door-to-door mobility of both passengers and freight. This is even more pertinent in view of new mobility trends and technologies, connected and automated vehicles, new physical and digital infrastructures and innovative services. At the same time however, a number of challenges remain to develop validated concepts and leverage multi-actor data exchange, ensure interoperability of new technologies and develop interfaces across transport modes, as well as to design appropriate governance arrangements for relevant public and private stakeholders.
In this context, building on best practices (technological, non-technological and socio-economic), ongoing projects on multimodal network and traffic management, as well as other initiatives (e.g. the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum), actions should address at least six of the following aspects:
Developing and carrying out validation for multimodal, dynamic, (cyber and physically) secure and resilient transport network and traffic management systems, leveraging state of the art technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, edge computing).
Demonstrating effective collection, analysis and use of network-wide fixed and variable data (e.g. using ICT and EU satellite-based information from vehicles, physical infrastructures and users) and developing integrated data management and monitoring systems, for effective and intelligent multimodal network and traffic management.
Developing new methods and tools for harmonised and comparable international monitoring of mobility demand, for passenger mobility and freight transport, including through survey data collection and big data processing, leveraging the opening of service providers’ databases to research and public authorities.
Conducting simulations for system-wide optimisation of demand/capacity balancing for multimodal passenger and freight flows, against foreseen (e.g. traffic disruption due to an important city-wide event) and unforeseen scenarios (e.g. major network/traffic disruption as a result of a hazard manifestation or compromise in transport safety due to a health emergency), to enable real-time prediction and balancing of mobility behaviour, as well as early problem detection and resolution.
Developing and testing network and traffic management visualisation and decision-making tools (e.g. using big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning), while taking into account regular mobility patterns (including soft modes) and user needs of citizens (including vulnerable road users and different gender groups) and businesses, as well as ad-hoc and flexible mobility-on-demand services, in the context of mobility/logistics as a service.
Demonstrating interoperability and enhanced interfaces of network and traffic management systems across stakeholders, transport modes and country borders.
Performing early pilot activities on multimodal network/traffic management, of limited scale and in defined environments, such as in the context of urban mobility of passengers and freight.
Conceiving, developing and preparing the introduction of next-generation multimodal network and traffic management services, provided by public and/or private stakeholders and operationalised at a centralised and/or decentralised level.
Develop and test implementable multi-level governance models, with roles and responsibilities for public and private stakeholders to share data and engage in transport network and traffic management functions, providing recommendations for further regulatory and policy actions.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.

","HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions
","28 April 2022
","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
An innovative, efficient, consistent and resilient enforcement system thanks to the direct contactless access to real-time digitized information on vehicle, driver and cargo by competent authorities.
A more competitive and fairer transport internal market thanks to the realisation of “compliance by design” and “compliance by default” principles.
Optimisation of the use of human and economic resources and increased productivity for both, public control authorities and transport operators, due to reduced administrative burden and time, while achieving a very significant increased control efficiency and consistency.
Improved transport workers social conditions and increased attractiveness of the sector, by reducing the pressure put on them as the main subjects responsible for law compliance.
Accelerated deployment of e-government services by authorities and uptake of digital solutions by transport operators for information exchange.
Decreased number of transport accidents, incidents and fatalities linked to the higher levels of compliance with road transport legislation.
Accelerated deployment of innovative connected, cooperative and automated mobility (CCAM) technologies and systems for passengers and goods to increase safety and reduce environmental impacts.
Scope:
The research and innovation activities should provide innovative solutions for allowing the authorities to access directly and in real time all relevant information required under the different pieces of legislation in “one click”. In particular, that should include social rules (such as Regulation No 561/2006 on Driving times and resting periods, Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on the Tachograph and Directive 2006/22/EC as regards enforcement requirements for posting drivers in the road transport sector), market rules (such as Regulation 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator, Regulations 1072/2009 and 1073/2009 on access to the market for freight and passenger road transport, Directive 96/53/EC on weights and dimensions of certain road vehicles, Directive (EU) 2016/797 on the interoperability of the rail system, Directive (EU) 2016/1629 on technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, and Directive 2005/44/EC on harmonised river information services (RIS) on inland waterways in the Community), as well as safety legislation (such as Directive 2006/126/EC on driving licences, Directive 2003/59/EC on the certificate of professional competence of drivers, Directive 2007/59/EC on the certification of train drivers and Directive (EU) 2017/2397 on the recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation).
Research and innovation actions are expected to bring together stakeholders at various level, from supply chain (e.g. manufacturers, retailers, freight forwarders and logistics service providers), transport services (e.g. transport operators, enforcing authorities) and infrastructure networks (e.g. road / rail / inland waterways operators and transport node public authorities) to ensure a truly integrated approach.
The technical solutions should take into account the work done in the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum[1] and in its subgroup on electronic documents in particular, and build on the existing electronic databases and exchange of information platforms (RESPER, ERRU, TACHONET, RIS, IMI, eFTI, etc.), as well as privately developed tools already in place, allowing for their interconnection or integration in order to provide seamless access and exchange of information under the “only once principle”. They should also develop existing and/or new concepts and systems to incorporate the areas that are not yet covered by such electronic databases and platforms. The aim is to achieve a comprehensive ecosystem for smart transport enforcement that is tested and proved to be viable, economically and technically, and allows for future integration with relevant information exchange systems in use or considered for deployment in all modes of transport, as part of a wider multimodal transport information exchange environment.
The research should also provide assessment and recommendations on ensuring that there is a business case for the operators to make the information available electronically to the authorities, and for the authorities to accept it and implement the means to use this information in line with the “only once principle”. Recommendations could eventually include the need for legislative measures to support the uptake of the digital and communication technologies for smart enforcement.
Furthermore, the research should consider the business case and conditions for reusing administrative information, where relevant, for the purposes beyond proving legal compliance. This includes, for instance, for compiling statistics, informing research, assessing the use of infrastructure, optimising logistics operations and maximising utilisation of assets.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

","28 April 2022
","06 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Developing and pilot testing at least three different business models scenarios based on collaboration platforms or public-private partnerships/project, each of them contributing to:
Congestion and air pollution reduction, reduced road risk, social inclusion, accessibility in each city (living lab)[1].
Increased share of new and shared mobility services (NMS) in the modal distribution, e.g. by 25% compared to a realistic baseline and financial viability of services.
Integration of new and shared mobility services with public transport (e.g. filling service gaps and off-peak periods), in at least following three collaborative use cases/living lab that will facilitate data sharing and connectivity with remote/peri-urban areas.
(Re-)Designing transport infrastructure[2] or upgrading/reusing existing infrastructure elements (e.g. street profile/layout, intersection/junction design, priority corridors/lanes, dedicated parking, charging/docking stations, street surfaces/pavements, etc.) to accommodate new mobility modes, patterns and behaviours with highest safety levels while being resilient to various climate conditions.
Developing results based policies as well as recommendations/each project in line with the Sustainable Urban Mobility Planning guidelines, to increase the understanding and take-up of new mobility services by local/regional authorities and public and private mobility service providers.
Actively engage in communicating the common learning, lesson drawing, evaluation, dissemination and the exchange of knowledge and best practices, both within the project and with the wider urban mobility and transport community.
Scope:
New and shared mobility services have shown that they have the potential to meet urban dweller’s needs while at the same time bring about a more rational use of cars. However, in order to succeed at delivering ‘’Mobility As a Service’’ and address the challenges that cities face, high-quality, user centric, and reliable new mobility solutions need to be offered as a credible alternative to the private car, coupled with safe and integrated infrastructure.
New solutions should be explored and deployed for newly designed or existing transport infrastructure to accommodate new and shared mobility services. Mobility services that could be considered are, for example: micro mobility, including bike/scoter sharing, demand responsive transport, car-pooling or car sharing.
New and shared mobility services should be proposed in at least 3 living labs/project in integrated, complementary and reinforcing packages of urban mobility and planning measures and new technological solutions, combining “push’’ and “pull” measures.
The services deployed should enable the idea of a social optimum in mobility from several perspectives (including socio-economic, environmental, health, accessibility; gender and inclusion; and safety and security aspects) while considering the implications for transport infrastructure and urban design.
The new services should also be tested beyond the commercially interesting urban cores, providing low and zero emission solutions for car-dependent suburban, peri-urban and rural areas linked to specific needs of diverse target groups such as populations with no access to public transport or affluent communities dependent on the private car.
Projects should test new and shared mobility services in mobility management (such as for companies, schools, attractions). Innovative approaches that respond to the needs of a large variety of users (such as families with children, people living in remote locations, commuters, housing developers) are expected. The role of marketing and communication, and approaches based on the co-creation of solutions should be considered.
Equally eligible would be cooperative approaches with employers willing to enter in a pilot to test a ‘Mobility as a Service’ (MaaS) type of service for their employees or with housing developers that are offering reduced parking spaces to residents and seek to offer smart and shared mobility solutions in return.
The proposals should also explore how the adaptation of transport infrastructure (e.g. bike-lanes or new street designs, profiles and layouts, etc…), promotes the use of shared, micro- and active- mobility, limiting risks and increasing safety while reducing transport congestion.
The results and impacts should be assessed using a wide range of quantitative indicators and compared with the situation before the implementation of the proposed solutions.
Public space redesign actions targeted by the awarded projects should not come at the cost of removing or deterioration of parks, trees or green recreational areas in the selected partner cities.
The potential adverse impacts some NMS may generate for example on high-density urban areas, on safety and security, travel demand, public transport use and traffic volumes, should be considered.
A demonstrated contribution to the implementation of the cities’ Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans is expected. Proposals should collaborate with the CIVITAS initiative. They should demonstrate that the proposed approaches are truly innovative for the local context. Proposals should ensure that an appropriate geographical balance across Europe is achieved through twinning activities and other means to maximise impact without leaving anyone behind, and by demonstrating commitment of cooperation though their planned activities.
Specific Topic Conditions:
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7-8 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.
[1]At least three living lab cities should be included as demonstrators of the innovative solutions and at least three follower cities. At least one of the living labs and follower cities should be located in areas experiencing rapid economic and social change.

Scope:
MSCA Staff Exchanges involve organisations from the academic and non-academic sectors (including SMEs) from across the globe.
Support is provided for international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility of R&I staff leading to knowledge transfer between participating organisations.
Mobility through secondments
The organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a joint R&I project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. Such a project must explore activities that can be based on previous work but should go beyond and generate or strengthen long-term collaborations. Secondments must always take place between legal entities independent from each other.
MSCA Staff Exchanges can address three dimensions of mobility: inter-sectoral, international and interdisciplinary[1]. While exchanges between organisations within EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries should mainly be inter-sectoral, same-sector exchanges[2] are also possible under the condition that they are interdisciplinary. Interdisciplinarity is not required for same-sector exchanges with non-associated Third Countries.
Secondments between institutions established in non-associated Third Countries or within the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country are not eligible.
The collaborative approach of MSCA Staff Exchanges should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations and create synergies between them. The secondments should be essential to achieve the joint project’s R&I activities. The project should inter alia enable networking activities and the organisation of workshops and conferences, to facilitate sharing of knowledge and testing of innovative approaches for specific R&I topics.
Skills’ development
For participating staff members, the project should offer new skills acquisition and career development perspectives. Participating organisations must ensure that the seconded staff are adequately mentored.

Scope:
Fellowships will be provided to excellent researchers, undertaking international mobility either to or between EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries, as well as to non-associated Third Countries. Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.
Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:
European Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.
Global Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to European nationals or long-term residents[1] who wish to engage in R&I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025[1].
Secondments
Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.
For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.
For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to one third of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or any other organisation mentioned in the description of the action), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Placements in the non-academic sector
Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers seeking a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[3]. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[4]. The request for such a placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. It must be substantiated by a letter of commitment from the European non-academic organisation where the placement takes place[5]. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.
Training activities
The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills[6], foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science) and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, etc.).
Career Development Plan
In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.

Scope:
MSCA Doctoral Networks will implement doctoral programmes, by partnerships of universities, research institutions and research infrastructures, businesses including SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe and beyond. MSCA Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries, in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of researchers.
These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&I areas, expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in research-related, as well as transferable skills[1] and competences relevant for innovation and long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.
The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS[2] website) must include the gross salary (not including employer’s social contributions) offered to the researcher.
MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.
Industrial Doctorates
Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Joint Doctorates
Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees[3] recognised in at least two EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries.
Steering Board
Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified steering board co-ordinating network-wide training and research activities and establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.
Training activities
MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training[4]. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.
Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.
Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, public engagement and citizen science, etc.).
Supervision
Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.
Career Development Plan
A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.

","01 June 2022
","21 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
integrated multi-disciplinary collaborative tools and services widely serving the European neuroscientific community, providing them with FAIR data indexing and archival, multilevel data mining and modelling/simulation of brain functions, and empowering workflows for reproducible research;
a rich collection of multilevel human brain models, atlases and workflows, directly supporting the research and development for personalised brain medical treatments e.g. target binding drugs, precise neuro-stimulation positioning and guided surgery, regarding brain diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson, consciousness disorders, or rare or multi-factor diseases;
a comprehensive set of cognitive brain model scaffolds and associated modular / large-size neuromorphic and neurorobotic facilities for assisting the design and validation of applicative cognitive technologies benefitting from neurosciences latest knowledge, as enablers for autonomous and adaptive robotics approaches that use fast sensory processing and decision-making capabilities;
supplementary population of EBRAINS facilities with multidisciplinary services/applications that answer well-identified new neuroscience related S&T needs, in correlation with national and European research priorities for neuroscience, brain medicine and cognitive-technologies;
integration of EBRAINS with EOSC and linkage with common European data spaces in the life science and health sector;
better-aligned national investments in neuroscience across Europe, building on the Member States’ and Associated Countries’ specialised competence centres, which in turn will help creating additional synergies and enabling further research activities around the EBRAINS services.
Scope:
Building on the EBRAINS architecture and base facilities developed under Horizon 2020, the scope of this action is to:
1. To implement a user-friendly service infrastructure along the principles of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) to widely serve the research communities in neurosciences, brain medicine and brain-inspired cognitive technologies. This includes the following dimensions:
Enabling the EBRAINS research infrastructure digital facilities supporting neuroscience dedicated tools and services, with a high quality of service including robustness, security, scalability, flexibility, usability and user-centricity. This includes a sustainable system for allocation and management of data capacities and of simulation and computing service resources.
Establishing in-depth collaboration with teams from other European research and testing infrastructures and of EOSC, in order to ensure efficiency and harmonisation, e.g. regarding Authorisation, Authentication and Identification (AAI), Persistent Identifiers (PID), discovery ontologies and API for both services and data.
Directly interfacing with the European HPC capacities towards exascale, deployed in EuroHPC and capitalising on the FENIX[1] developments for big-data integration and interactive use.
Delivering an efficient Europe-wide service to researchers, based on promoting excellence and innovation, and supporting users’ digital experiments with the assistance of high-level support teams and feedback mechanisms, and guiding communities in developing novel software solutions that build on the EBRAINS base offering.
Deploying an open metrics framework to assess the EBRAINS performances reached, the efficiency of the facilities offered in particular regarding the human-based services, and the uptake especially regarding the enabled science excellence and related results and the medical and technological innovation empowerment.
2. To develop, integrate in EBRAINS, and operate:
Constantly improving open science services/applications that respond to up-to-date and upcoming identified needs of the neuroscientific community, with a co-design approach and in-depth engagement with scientific, medical and industrial stakeholders and the establishment of an appropriate and transparent prioritisation mechanism. This includes ensuring openness to other research groups and new applications; reaching out to scientific and industrial communities, including with tailored training and skills development programmes.
The deployment of complementary S&T services from regional or national competence nodes, supporting and enriching the cloud-based deliveries and facilitating the sharing of produced data and use of national resources.
In addition to the above, EBRAINS should open its approaches to other communities, going beyond neuroscience, for example by supporting compute-intensive simulation to identify candidate drugs addressing new disease targets in other explicit medical domains where this approach is justified.
The financial support to third parties mechanism (see specific call conditions) can be used to design and develop new services (under item 2) and/or to facilitate the co-design approaches and/or the targeted involvement of broader stakeholders, user communities and competence nodes.

Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating organisations.
Scope:
Applicants submit proposals for new or existing doctoral or postdoctoral programmes with an impact on the enhancement of human resources in R&I at regional, national or international level. These programmes will be co-funded by MSCA COFUND.
Proposed programmes can cover any research disciplines (""bottom-up""), but exceptionally can also focus on specific disciplines, notably when they are based on national or regional Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies). In this case, the range of covered disciplines should allow reasonable flexibility for the researchers to define their topic.
Funding synergies with Cohesion policy funds and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) are strongly encouraged[1],[2].
A Career Development Plan must be jointly established by the supervisor and each recruited researcher upon recruitment. In addition to research objectives, this Plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aimed at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan must be established at the beginning of the recruitment and should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.
COFUND takes the form of:
A) Doctoral programmes
Doctoral programmes offer research training activities to allow doctoral candidates to develop and broaden their skills and competences. They will lead to the award of a doctoral degree in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The training activities should be based on the EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral Training.
Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship will be supported. They will include, inter alia, training on the use of collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, public engagement and citizen science.
On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Collaboration with a wider set of associated partners, including from the non-academic sector, will be positively taken into account during the evaluation. These organisations may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training modules in research or transferable skills.
Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS[3] website) must include the minimum gross salary (not including employer’s social contributions) offered to the researcher.
B) Postdoctoral Programmes
Postdoctoral Programmes fund individual advanced research training and career development fellowships for postdoctoral researchers. The programmes should offer training to develop key transferable skills and competences common to all fields, foster innovation and entrepreneurship and promote and (where appropriate) reward Open Science practices (open access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, public engagement and citizen science, etc.).
Postdoctoral Programmes should have regular selection rounds following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between researchers. The selections should be open, widely advertised (including on the EURAXESS website), competitive, merit-based and with a transparent international peer review, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice must include the minimum gross salary (not including employer’s social contributions) offered to the postdoctoral researcher.
On top of compulsory international mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Researchers will be able to freely choose a research topic and the appropriate organisation to host them, fitting their individual needs.

","HORIZON TMA MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships - European Fellowships
","29 June 2022
","29 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
This action will build on the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2022 action (HORIZON-MSCA-PF-2022). The target group are host organisations located in Widening Countries.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For supported ERA Fellows:
Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of fellows within academia and beyond;
New mind-sets and approaches to R&I work forged through interdisciplinary, inter-sectoral and international experience;
Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact;
For participating organisations in the Widening Countries:
Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers;
Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;
Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation of the participating organisation(s);
Stronger R&I capacity and output among participating organisations; better transfer of knowledge;
Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating organisations.
For Widening countries:
Increased attractiveness for researchers to entities in widening countries, by providing competitive grants and spreading attractive working and employment practices;
More postdoctoral researchers attracted to widening countries.
Scope:
Fellowships should be provided to excellent researchers[1], undertaking cross-border mobility either to or between EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries. Applications are expected to be made jointly by the researcher together with a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector located in a Widening Country.
ERA Fellowships should take place in a Widening Country. Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe to a Widening Country.
Secondments
Researchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.
Placements in the non-academic sector
ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers seeking a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. It must be substantiated by a Letter of Commitment from the European non-academic organisation hosting the secondment[2]. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.
Training activities
The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills[3], foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science) and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, etc.).
Career Development Plan
In order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan has to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.
Specific Topic Conditions:
The expected EU contribution depends on the number of person-months requested. For the applicable unit contributions, see specific conditions for the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships at the end of the MSCA Work Programme part.
[1]The part of the MSCA Work Programme referring to synergies with the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025 does not apply to the ERA Fellowships.
