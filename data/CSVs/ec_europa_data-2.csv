","15 September 2022","Scope:
Alliances for Innovation aim to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity by boosting innovation through cooperation and flow of knowledge among higher education, vocational education and training (both initial and continuous), and the broader socio-economic environment, including research.
They also aim to boost the provision of new skills and address skills mismatches by designing and creating new curricula for higher education (HE) and vocational education and training (VET), supporting the development of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets in the EU.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
These partnerships shall implement a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities, which should be adaptable to future knowledge developments across the EU.
To boost innovation, the focus will be on digital skills as they are increasingly important in all job profiles across the entire labour market. Also, the transition to a circular and greener economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging professional needs for green skills and sustainable development.
Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills aim to create new strategic approaches and cooperation for concrete skills development solutions – both in the short and the medium term – in given economic sectors, or in areas implementing a major action of the European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience, the Pact for Skills. The main objective of the Pact is to mobilise and incentivize all relevant stakeholders to take concrete actions for the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce, by pooling efforts and setting up partnerships, also at EU level addressing the needs of the labour market, supporting green and digital transitions as well as national, regional and local skills and growth strategies. Therefore, the deliverables of Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills, i.e. sectoral skills intelligence, skills strategies, occupational profiles, training programmes, and long-term planning, will be an important contribution to the work of the sectoral partnerships that have joined the Pact for Skills.
Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills seek to tackle skills gaps on the labour market that hamper growth, innovation and competitiveness in specific sectors or areas, aiming both at short term interventions and long term strategies. These Alliances will be implemented in the 14 industrial ecosystems identified in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe (COM/2020/102 final: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0102) (see eligibility criteria).
The Pact for Skills builds on and absorbs the Blueprint for sectoral cooperation on skills. Therefore, Alliances under Lot 2 will support the implementation of the Pact by developing a sectoral skills strategy. This strategy has to lead to systemic and structural impact on reducing skills shortages, gaps and mismatches, as well as ensuring appropriate quality and levels of skills. The sectoral skills strategy must include a clear set of activities, milestones and well-defined objectives with the goal to match demand and supply of skills to support the overall sector-specific growth strategy. The Alliances aim to build the base for the Pact for Skills and define the pathway that should be continued after the project is finalised.
Drawing on evidence regarding skills needs with regard to occupational profiles, Blueprint Alliances support the design and delivery of transnational education & training content, as well as teaching and training methodologies, for quick take-up at regional and local level and for new occupations that are emerging.
Proposals should include the design of continuing vocational training programmes to address urgent skills needs of people in working age. Proposals should also include developments of emerging occupational profiles, related qualifications, which should cover upper and post-secondary VET levels (EQF levels 3 to 5) and tertiary levels (EQF levels 6 to 8). Furthermore, proposals should include the design of related core curricula and education and training programmes leading to those qualifications.
Each project must include among its partners both vocational education and training (VET) and higher education (HE) organisations and labour market actors. Ideally they also involve policy bodies, certifying bodies as well as European sectoral associations and representatives of industry.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
Each Alliance shall implement a coherent, comprehensive and variable set of interconnected activities to enhance innovation in higher education, vocational education and training and enterprises (including large, small and mediumsized enterprises and social enterprises) and the broader socio economic environment.
The following activities must be implemented:
Developing a strategic approach to sectoral cooperation on skills
Setting up sustainable cooperation on skills development between key industry stakeholders including social partners, education and training providers, and public authorities (on national and regional level). The project will also aim at building cooperation between large companies and micro, small and medium companies (SMEs) throughout the value chain in a particular industrial ecosystem;
Gathering skills intelligence on a continuous basis: delivering relevant EU and country and/or regional level qualitative evidence and quantitative data according to linked open data format; developing a common methodology for anticipating future skills needs as well as monitoring (on a yearly basis) progress and the evolution of the demand and supply of skills based on credible foresight scenarios, drawing on the EU Skills Panorama and, where relevant, the work of the OECD, the World Economic Forum and existing Sector Skills Alliances;
Mapping of existing upskilling and reskilling support available in the sector/ecosystem (provided by industry, public and private stakeholders) and identifying which of those actions could be upscaled to support companies in the value chains;
Based on the skills intelligence, developing a skills strategy for the industrial ecosystem including priorities for actions to support the objectives of re- and upskilling the workforce of the industrial ecosystem and those who could join the sector (e.g. economically inactive). The strategy should detail how major trends, such as global, societal, and technological developments in the industrial ecosystem, are likely to affect jobs and skills needs. It should describe the expected timeline and give particular attention to the impact of digital and key enabling technologies. It should identify and define occupations and related skills that are likely to emerge in the sector (i.e. will be completely new). It should also identify key industrial players and stakeholders that should be involved in the implementation of the strategy. This strategy should be the one of the first key deliverable of the project, indicating a clear set of activities, milestones and well-defined outputs, as well as setting out concrete priority actions suggesting how to match future demand and supply of skills for these emerging occupations. The strategy should be used as a base for building the partnership under the Pact for Skills;
Where relevant, ensuring that results of the project are available in open data format so that they can feed into the EU Skills Panorama and the European Skills, Competencies, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO);
Delivering relevant EU and country and/or regional level qualitative evidence and quantitative data according to linked open data format.
Designing European sector-wide agreed ‘core’ curricula and training programmes
Within the first year of activity (reactive response)
In parallel to the actions above, all projects should rapidly address urgent skills needs in occupations in an industrial
ecosystem resulting from the Covid-19 crisis and the digital and green transition (evidence to be provided in the proposal):
Drawing on, where available, the occupational profiles of the Classification of ESCO and existing competence frameworks (E.g. the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens, the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework and the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF));
Designing continuing vocational training programmes for up-skilling and re-skilling the labour force by innovative blended and work-based learning;
Ensuring the good quality of the content and provision of the new training programmes by applying quality assurance methods in line with EQAVET and ESG (European Standards & Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Higher Education);
Ensuring rapid uptake and use of the training programmes by reaching out to main players in value chains within the industrial ecosystem, to Centres of Vocational Excellence (https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1501), to regions implementing smart specialisation strategies (https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home), to European Cluster Partnerships (https://www.clustercollaboration.eu) and to Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Technology (EIT) (https://eit.europa.eu/) that are active in the same industrial ecosystem.
Throughout the project (proactive response).
Projects should then work on developing training content for emerging occupational profiles:
On the basis of identified skills needs for emerging occupational profiles in an industrial ecosystem given economic sector, designing new modular VET curricula and related qualifications for initial education & training (E&T) (full curricula for integration in national education & training systems), and continuing vocational training programmes for up-skilling or re-skilling the people of working age (modules addressing emerging skills needs);
These curricula and training programmes shall be composed of units of learning outcomes, in line with the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) / National Qualifications Frameworks (NQFs) and informed by ESCO; curricula should deliver job-specific skills as well as key competences (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2018.189.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:C:2018:189:TOC), that include notably transversal skills and STEAM disciplines (Science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics);
Integrating periods of work-based learning into the new training content, including opportunities to apply knowledge in practical ""real life"" workplace situations, and embedding trans-national learning experience whenever possible;
Applying quality management to the new training content either by applying the quality assurance principles of EQAVET and ESG or by using already existing quality assurance systems which, however, should be in line with EQAVET and ESG;
Promoting relevant sectoral qualifications including trans-national joint programmes awarded by more than one E&T provider, thus facilitating cross-border certification, and building mutual trust, contributing to increased learner and professional mobility in the sector.
Delivering the ‘core’ curricula and training programmes
Developing delivery methodologies for the curricula and training programmes, that are adapted to the various target groups, using innovative approaches to teaching and learning, including the provision of work-based learning, the use of ICTs (e.g. blended learning, simulators, augmented reality, etc.), virtual/blended mobility solutions for learners and staff, and open educational resources (e.g. AI-enhanced learning, MOOC´s (MOOC is a Massive Open Online Course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. In addition to traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets, many MOOCs provide interactive user forums to support community interactions among students, professors, and teaching assistants.));
Developing actions to facilitate inter-generational transfer of professional knowledge;
Describing the ways in which assessment methodologies and procedures can cover all forms of learning, including work-based learning, and facilitate the validation of skills and competences acquired prior to training;
Building on established contacts and on new contacts established with the skills demand side during the skills intelligence phase, reaching out to providers of employment opportunities, such as private and public employers and employment services, for potential matching with training graduates;
Identifying adequate measures to track learners after completing their training in order to provide ""feedback loops"" (See Medium-term deliverable 2 (MTD2), in 2015 Riga Conclusions: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail /-/publication/200c516d-b8de-4c2aa233-218671296c8d/language-en). These tracking and feedback systems can build on information from companies, learners/employees, as well as public information resources and labour market stakeholders;
Proposing the appropriate measures for the formal recognition of the new or adapted vocational VET and HE curricula and qualifications in the countries where partners are located and in the industrial ecosystem covered.
Designing a long term action plan for the progressive roll-out of project deliverables after the project has finished
This plan shall be based on sustained partnerships between education and training providers, key industry stakeholders and public authorities (regional or national) at the appropriate level to facilitate/strengthen multi-stakeholder skills partnerships under the Pact for Skills for re- and upskilling the workforce. It should include the identification of appropriate governance structures, as well as plans for scalability and financial sustainability;
The plan shall ensure the appropriate visibility and wide dissemination of the results, including at EU and national/regional political level and include details on how the roll-out will be implemented at national and/or regional levels with relevant public authorities;
The plan shall foresee how the deliverables of the project, in particular the skills intelligence, the strategy and the training programmes, will be updated following the end of the 4 year duration of the project, including by foreseeing its future sources of funding;
The plan shall indicate how EU funding opportunities (e.g. recovery and resilience facility (RRF), EU multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, including European Structural Funds, InvestEU, Erasmus+), as well as private investment and national/regional funding can support skills strategies. This should take into account Smart Specialisation Strategies, European cluster partnerships, the platforms of Centres of Vocational Excellence and the Innovation Communities of the EIT.
Alliances for Innovation are required to apply EU wide instruments and tools, such as the EQF, ESCO, Europass, EQAVET
and ESG, whenever relevant.
To try and test new curricula or new training and learning methods, Alliances for Innovation may organise learning mobility activities of students, teachers, researchers and staff in so far as they support/complement the main activities of the partnerships and bring added value in the implementation of the project's objectives.
EXPECTED IMPACT
Alliances for Innovation will be anchored in strategic and sustainable cooperation among vocational education and training, higher education and enterprises working together to boost the innovation capacity of Europe. They will considerably strengthen the synergies between both educational fields in fostering innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets. These Alliances among HE, VET and the enterprises are expected to contribute to the development of regional eco-systems and directly provide a valuable input to the economy, integrating workbased learning. While universities have research knowledge and data that allows them to directly provide input to small and medium sized enterprises to boost local economies, VET providers supply skills needed by enterprises and they are able to foster growth in the local economy.
At a larger scale, Alliances for Innovation are expected to target societal and economic challenges, both in education and employment, and take into account key areas such as innovation challenges, skills provision, climate change, green economy, demography, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Benefits can also be drawn from cooperation with large enterprises. The Alliances for Innovation will focus on the need of citizens and accelerate the modernization of HE and VET.
The Pact for Skills will not only establish a framework for the implementation of the other actions of the updated Skills Agenda, but also for the dissemination and exploitation of the project results of the Alliances for Innovation. In particular the results of the Blueprint Alliances for sectoral cooperation on skills will be used as a basis for the Pact for Skills sectoral large-scale partnerships.
In addition, the Alliances will help to implement the EU Communication on the Renewed Agenda for Higher Education (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017DC0247) and contribute to the creation of a European Education Area (https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area_en). They will also contribute to implement the EU Industrial and SMEs strategies (2021).
The Alliances for Innovation will also take into account the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and the Paris Declaration on Climate Change (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) as overarching parameters of the action, thus helping the European Commission to implement its new Green Deal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/european-green-deal-communication_en.pdf) and the Europe Recovery Plan (https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en). The Alliances will also contribute ideas to the New European Bauhaus initiative (https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en) which aims to design new sustainable ways of living to meet the objectives of the Green Deal.
Alliances for Innovation are meant to have a short and long term impact on the wider range of stakeholders involved, at individual, organisational and systemic level. This impact is expected to go beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations involved in the partnerships. It is expected that partnership and activities persist. For that, results/deliverables might not be stand-alone but be linked to/integrated into existing undertakings, schemes, projects, platforms, ventures etc.
AWARD CRITERIA
Relevance of the project (maximum score 25 points)
Link to EU policy and initiatives: the proposal takes into account and contributes to achieving the European objectives in the field of HE and VET and sectoral EU policies relevant for chosen industrial ecosystem, contributes to the Pact for Skills and the European Skills Agenda and takes into account EU tools. A proposal addressing an industrial ecosystem in which a Blueprint Alliance is already ongoing in that ecosystem must clearly be complementary, i.e. cover a clearly different field, and must specify what results of ongoing Blueprint project/s it will build on; there must not be any overlaps in scope, outputs and activities. At equal quality, a proposal covering an ecosystem or part of an ecosystem that is not covered by an ongoing Blueprint Alliance will be more relevant than a proposal covering a part of an ecosystem where a Blueprint is already ongoing;

Only 1 proposal per ecosystem can be funded.
To be considered for funding, proposals must score at least 70 points taking into account the necessary minimum pass score for each of the four award criteria: minimum 13 points for the “relevance of the project” category; 16 points for “quality of the project design and implementation”, 13 points for “quality of the partnership and the cooperation arrangements” and 11 points for “impact”.
WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?
This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call.
The maximum EU grant per project is as follows:
4 million euros (4 years project) - only one proposal per industrial ecosystem can be selected for funding.
At equal quality, a proposal covering an ecosystem that is not at all covered by an ongoing Blueprint Alliance will be assessed as more relevant.
How is the project lump sum determined?
Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following
points:
a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into ‘project management’, ‘training’, ‘organization of events’, ‘mobility preparation and implementation’, ‘communication and dissemination’, ‘quality assurance’, etc.);
b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the estimated costs showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);
d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such us dissemination of information, publishing or translation).
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.
Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out.
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.
The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.
More details are described in the model Grant Agreement available in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP)."

","25 November 2021
","15 September 2022","Scope:
Alliances for Innovation aim to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity by boosting innovation through cooperation and flow of knowledge among higher education, vocational education and training (both initial and continuous), and the broader socio-economic environment, including research.
They also aim to boost the provision of new skills and address skills mismatches by designing and creating new curricula for higher education (HE) and vocational education and training (VET), supporting the development of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets in the EU.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
These partnerships shall implement a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities, which should be adaptable to future knowledge developments across the EU.
To boost innovation, the focus will be on digital skills as they are increasingly important in all job profiles across the entire labour market. Also, the transition to a circular and greener economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging professional needs for green skills and sustainable development.
Alliances for Education and Enterprises are transnational, structured and result-driven projects, in which partners share common goals and work together to foster innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets.
They aim to foster innovation in higher education, vocational education and training, enterprises and the broader socioeconomic environment. This includes confronting societal and economic challenges such as climate change, changing demographics, digitalisation, artificial intelligence and rapid employment changes through social innovation and community resilience, as well as labour market innovation.
Alliances for Education and Enterprises bring together enterprises and both higher education and vocational training providers to work together in partnership. Operating within one economic sector or several different economic sectors, they create reliable and sustainable relations and demonstrate their innovative and transnational character in all aspects. While each partnership must include at least one VET and one higher education organisation, they can address either both or one of these educational fields.
They intend to achieve one or more of the following aims:
Fostering new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning: fostering innovation in education design and delivery, teaching methods, assessment techniques, learning environments and/or developing new skills;
Fostering corporate social responsibility (e.g. equity, inclusion, climate change, environmental protection and sustainable development);
Stimulating a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial attitudes, mind-sets and skills in learners, educational staff and other workers, in line with the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (EntreComp https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC101581/lfna27939enn.pdf);
Improving the quality and relevance of skills developed and certified through education and training systems (including new skills and tackling skills mismatches);
Facilitating the flow and co-creation of knowledge between higher education and vocational education and training, research, the public sector and the business sector;
Building and supporting effective and efficient higher education and vocational education and training systems, which are connected and inclusive, and contribute to innovation.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
Each Alliance shall implement a coherent, comprehensive and variable set of interconnected activities to enhance innovation in higher education, vocational education and training and enterprises (including large, small and medium sized enterprises and social enterprises) and the broader socio economic environment.
At least one of the following activities (non-exhaustive list) must be included in each Alliance for Education and Enterprises:
Boosting innovation
Jointly developing and implementing new learning and teaching methods (like new multidisciplinary curricula, learner-centred and real problem-based teaching and learning, making greater use of micro-credentials);
Developing and testing continuous education programmes and activities with and within enterprises;
Developing and testing solutions to pressing social demands not addressed by the market and directed towards vulnerable groups in society; addressing societal challenges or relating to changes in attitudes and values, strategies and policies, organisational structures and processes, delivery systems and services;
Developing solutions for challenging issues, product and process innovation (through the collaboration of students, professors and practitioners).
Developing a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets, competences and skills
Developing new teaching methods and learning tools that incorporate transversal skills learning and application throughout higher education and VET programmes developed in cooperation with enterprises and aimed at strengthening employability, creativity and new professional pathways;
Introducing wherever appropriate a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in a given discipline, curriculum, course, etc. to provide students, researchers, staff and educators with the competences, skills and motivation to develop a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-set and to be able to confront various challenges in their educational, professional and private lives;
Opening up new learning opportunities through the practical experiences and application of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial competences and skills which can involve and/or lead to the launch of new services, products and prototypes, and the creation of start-ups and spin-offs;
Introducing more ""student-centred approaches"" with students tailor-making their own educational pathways.
Stimulating the flow and exchange of knowledge between higher education, VET, enterprises and research
Building inclusive and connected HE, VET systems and enterprises through mutual trust, cross-border recognition and certification, flexible pathways between VET and HE and fostering the mobility for learners and workers;
Apprenticeships and study field related activities in enterprises, which are fully embedded in the curriculum, recognised and credited; set-ups to trial and test innovative measures; exchanges of students, researchers, teaching staff and enterprise staff for a limited period; providing incentives for involvement of enterprise staff into teaching and research; analysis of research data.
Identifying resilience-related, market needs and emerging professions
Identifying market needs and emerging professions (demand side), enhancing the responsiveness of systems at all levels to labour market needs (supply side); adapting HE and VET provision to skills needs by designing and delivering transnational sector-wide curricula integrating work-based learning;
Identifying those skills that are needed in the public domain to solve societal challenges (e.g. climate change, health) and encourage resilience at societal and community level, including via the cooperation of HEIs and VET providers with national, regional and local authorities as well as the private sector to contribute to designing and implementing Smart Specialisation Strategies in regions;
Providing support to overcome the skills mismatch both for resilience and market needs.
Alliances for Innovation are required to apply EU wide instruments and tools, such as the EQF, ESCO, Europass, EQAVET and ESG, whenever relevant.
To try and test new curricula or new training and learning methods, Alliances for Innovation may organise learning mobility activities of students, teachers, researchers and staff in so far as they support/complement the main activities of the partnerships and bring added value in the implementation of the project's objectives.
EXPECTED IMPACT
Alliances for Innovation will be anchored in strategic and sustainable cooperation among vocational education and training, higher education and enterprises working together to boost the innovation capacity of Europe. They will considerably strengthen the synergies between both educational fields in fostering innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets. These Alliances among HE, VET and the enterprises are expected to contribute to the development of regional eco-systems and directly provide a valuable input to the economy, integrating workbased learning. While universities have research knowledge and data that allows them to directly provide input to small and medium sized enterprises to boost local economies, VET providers supply skills needed by enterprises and they are able to foster growth in the local economy.
At a larger scale, Alliances for Innovation are expected to target societal and economic challenges, both in education and employment, and take into account key areas such as innovation challenges, skills provision, climate change, green economy, demography, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Benefits can also be drawn from cooperation with large enterprises. The Alliances for Innovation will focus on the need of citizens and accelerate the modernization of HE and VET.
The Pact for Skills will not only establish a framework for the implementation of the other actions of the updated Skills Agenda, but also for the dissemination and exploitation of the project results of the Alliances for Innovation. In particular the results of the Blueprint Alliances for sectoral cooperation on skills will be used as a basis for the Pact for Skills sectoral large-scale partnerships.
In addition, the Alliances will help to implement the EU Communication on the Renewed Agenda for Higher Education (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017DC0247) and contribute to the creation of a European Education Area (https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area_en). They will also contribute to implement the EU Industrial and SMEs strategies (2021).
The Alliances for Innovation will also take into account the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and the Paris Declaration on Climate Change (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) as overarching parameters of the action, thus helping the European Commission to implement its new Green Deal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/european-green-deal-communication_en.pdf) and the Europe Recovery Plan (https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en). The Alliances will also contribute ideas to the New European Bauhaus initiative (https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en) which aims to design new sustainable ways of living to meet the objectives of the Green Deal.
Alliances for Innovation are meant to have a short and long term impact on the wider range of stakeholders involved, at individual, organisational and systemic level. This impact is expected to go beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations involved in the partnerships. It is expected that partnership and activities persist. For that, results/deliverables might not be stand-alone but be linked to/integrated into existing undertakings, schemes, projects, platforms, ventures etc.

CENTRES OF VOCATIONAL EXCELLENCE
The initiative on Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE) supports a bottom-up approach to Vocational Excellence involving a wide range of local stakeholders. It enables VET institutions to rapidly adapt skills provision to evolving economic and social needs, including the digital and green transitions. CoVEs operate in a given local context, being the linchpin of skills ecosystems for innovation, regional development, and social inclusion, while working with CoVEs in other countries through international collaborative networks.
They provide opportunities for initial training of young people as well as the continuing up-skilling and re-skilling of adults, through flexible and timely offer of training that meets the needs of a dynamic labour market, in the context of the green and digital transitions. They act as catalysts for local business innovation, by working closely with companies and in particular SMEs.
Vocational Excellence ensures high quality skills and competences that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, which meet the needs of an innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy.
The concept of Vocational Excellence proposed here is characterised by a holistic learner centred approach in which VET:
Is an integrated part of skills ecosystems, contributing to regional development, innovation, smart specialisation and clusters strategies, as well as to specific value chains and industrial ecosystems
Is part of knowledge triangles, working closely with other education and training sectors, the scientific community, the creative sector, and business
Enables learners to acquire both vocational (job specific) as well as key competences through high-quality provision that is underpinned by quality assurance
Builds innovative forms of partnerships with the world of work, and is supported by the continuous professional development of teaching and training staff, innovative pedagogies, learner and staff mobility and VET internationalisation strategies
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
This action supports the gradual establishment and development of international collaborative networks of Centres of Vocational Excellence, contributing to creating skills ecosystems for innovation, regional development, and social inclusion. Centres of Vocational Excellence will operate at two levels:
1. At national level involving a wide range of local stakeholders creating skills ecosystems for local innovation, regional development, and social inclusion, while working with CoVEs in other countries through international collaborative networks.
2. At international level bringing together CoVEs that share a common interest in:
specific sectors or industrial ecosystems ,
innovative approaches to tackle societal challenges (e.g. climate change, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, sustainable development goals, integration of migrants, upskilling people with low qualification levels, etc.), or
innovative approaches to increase the outreach, quality and effectiveness of existing CoVEs.
The networks will bring together existing CoVEs in different countries, or develop the Vocational Excellence model by linking partners from various countries, that intend to develop Vocational Excellence in their local context through international cooperation. They could contribute e.g. to the delivery phase of the New European Bauhaus initiative by collaborating with the communities involved in the local transformations fostered by the initiative.
The networks aim for ""upward convergence"" of VET excellence. They will be open for the involvement of countries with well-developed vocational excellence systems, as well as those in the process of developing similar approaches, aimed at exploring the full potential of VET institutions to play a proactive role in support of growth and innovation.
CoVEs are intended for organisations providing vocational education and training, at any EQF levels from 3 to 8, including the upper-secondary level, the post-secondary non-tertiary level as well as the tertiary level (e.g. Universities of applied sciences, Polytechnic institutes, etc.).
However, applications cannot include only activities that target learners at tertiary level; applications that focus on VET at tertiary level (EQF levels 6 to 8) must include at least one other VET qualification level between EQF levels 3 to 5, as well as a strong work-based learning component.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
CoVEs are characterised by adopting a systemic approach through which VET institutions actively contribute to co-create ""skills ecosystems"", together with a wide range of other local/regional partners. CoVE´s are expected to go far beyond the simple provision of a quality vocational qualification.
A non-exhaustive list of typical activities and services provided by CoVEs is presented below. Projects will reach their objectives by building on a combination of a sub-set of these activities The project must include relevant deliverables linked to the following three clusters:
at least 3 of the activities listed in the Application Form under Cluster 1 - Teaching and learning,
at least 3 of the activities listed in the Application Form under Cluster 2 - Cooperation and partnership, and
at least 2 of the activities listed in the Application Form under Cluster 3 - Governance and funding.
Cluster 1 - Teaching and learning
i. Providing people with labour market relevant skills including those necessary for the green and digital transitions, in a lifelong learning and inclusive approach providing learning opportunities to people of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds. Combining offers of initial VET qualifications, with offers of continuing training for upskilling and reskilling (including micro-credentials), that are informed by skills intelligence
ii. Providing guidance services, as well as validation of prior learning.
iii. Developing innovative curricula that focus both on technical skills and key competences, while making use of European competence frameworks and derivative tools (e.g. DigComp, EntreComp , LifeComp, SELFIE WBL, and the European Digital Skill Certificate).
iv. Developing innovative learner-centred teaching and learning methodologies, including interdisciplinary, project-based, competence-based learning, “Learning factories”, makerspaces as well as providing opportunities for international mobility (including internationalisation at home), while fully exploiting digital technologies such as MOOC's, simulators, virtual reality, Artificial intelligence, etc..
v. Fostering learner excellence through actions that incentive VET learners to explore their innovation and creative potential, leading to a virtuous cycle of benefits for the learners, the teachers and the VET institution that can integrate best practices into regular programmes.
vi. Developing modular and learner-centred international VET learning provision ensuring its recognition, as well as the transparency, understanding and portability of learning achievements, including through the development and/or use of micro-credentials and European vocational “core profiles”, and using the Europass Digital Credentials tool.
vii. Providing higher-level VET programmes, developing flexible pathways, and cooperation mechanisms between VET and higher education institutions.
viii. Investing in the initial and continuing professional development of teachers and trainers , for pedagogical, technical, and in particular digital skills including those necessary for online and distance learning, as well as for the implementation of a quality culture based on defined management systems .
ix. Establishing strong quality assurance mechanisms aligned with European tools and instruments, which may also include working towards the certification of education and training providers based on standards developed by relevant national and/or international standards organisations - e.g. ISO 21001 or EFQM (see also EVTA label for VET Excellence).
x. Establishing effective feedback loops and graduate tracking systems that enable the timely adaptation of learning provision to evolving labour market needs.
Cluster 2 - Cooperation and partnerships

xvi. Developing VET internationalisation strategies, including those to foster international mobility (including virtual mobility) of VET learners, teachers and trainers, as well as leaders. This could also include preparatory work to facilitate mobility such as teaching programmes or courses on EU studies to improve understanding of Europe's integration process and its place in a globalised world (e.g. inspired on the Jean Monnet actions).
xvii. Launching and actively participating in campaigns and activities to raise the attractiveness of VET and awareness to the life and job opportunities provided by VET qualifications. These initiatives could attract more people (including learners in primary and secondary schools) to specific professions, and contribute to the European Vocational Skills Week.
xviii. Participating in national and international skills competitions, aimed at raising the attractiveness and excellence in VET.
xix. Developing ""International VET campus/academies"". Aimed at learners in primary, secondary, and VET schools, teachers and trainers, leaders in VET institutions, Trade unions, as well as for people considering future vocational study options. These could focus on specific occupational fields, products or services, as well as on complex challenges of societal and economic importance.
Cluster 3 - Governance and funding
xx. Ensuring the adequate autonomy , and the effective governance at all levels involving relevant stakeholders, particularly companies, chambers, professional and sector associations, trade unions, national and regional authorities and social partners.
xxi. Actively engaging in the overall national Skills governance systems and linking with employment and social policies at local, regional, national and European level.

These can include the support of education and training actions, mobility of learners and staff, applied research activities, infrastructure investments to modernise VET centres with advanced equipment, implementation of management systems to assure excellence and sustainability of VET organizations and the services they provide, etc.
CoVEs are not intended to build new VET institutions and infrastructure from scratch (although they may also do so), but instead to bring together a set of local/regional partners, such as initial and continuing VET providers, tertiary education institutions including universities of applied sciences and polytechnics, research institutions, companies, chambers, social partners, national and regional authorities and development agencies, public employment services, etc.
Projects are required to apply EU wide instruments and tools whenever relevant.
Projects must include the design of a long-term action plan for the progressive roll-out of project deliverables after the project has finished. This plan shall be based on sustained partnerships between education and training providers and key industry stakeholders at the appropriate level. It should include the identification of appropriate governance structures, as well as plans for scalability and financial sustainability. It should also ensure the appropriate visibility and wide dissemination of the work of the platforms, including at EU and national political level and include details on how the roll-out will be implemented at European, national and/or regional levels with relevant partners. The action plan shall also indicate how EU funding opportunities (e.g. European Structural Funds, European Fund for Strategic Investment, Erasmus+, COSME, sectoral programmes), and national and regional funding (as well as private funding), can support the roll-out of the project. This should take into account national and regional smart specialisation strategies.
EXPECTED IMPACT
The gradual establishment and development of European platforms of Centres of Vocational Excellence is expected to increase the attractiveness of vocational education and training and to ensure that it is at the forefront of providing solutions to the challenges posed by rapidly changing skills needs.
By forming an essential part of the “knowledge triangle” – the close collaboration between businesses, education and research – and playing a fundamental role in providing skills to support innovation and smart specialisation, the Centres of Vocational Excellence are expected to ensure high quality skills and competences that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, which meet the needs of an innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy. This approach is expected to pave the way for VET to act within a more comprehensive and inclusive conceptualisation of skills provision, addressing innovation, pedagogy, social justice, life-long learning, transversal skills, organisational and continuing professional learning and community needs.
By being firmly anchored within regional/local contexts while at the same time operating at transnational level, the Centres of Vocational Excellence will form strong and enduring partnerships between the VET community and the world of work at national level and across borders. They will thereby ensure the continuous relevance of skills provision and achieve results that would be difficult to obtain without knowledge sharing and sustained cooperation.
Through the wide dissemination of project outcomes at transnational, national and/or regional levels and the development of a long term action plan for the progressive roll out of project deliverables, taking national and regional smart specialisation strategies into account, individual projects are expected to engage relevant stakeholders within and outside the participating organisations and ensure a lasting impact after the project lifetime.

WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?
This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call. The maximum EU grant per project is 4 million euros
HOW IS THE PROJECT LUMP SUM DETERMINED?
Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following points:
a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into ‘project management’, ‘training’, ‘organization of events’, ‘mobility preparation and implementation’, ‘communication and dissemination’, ‘quality assurance’, etc.);
b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the lump sum showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);
d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such as dissemination of information, publishing or translation).
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action.
Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.
The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.
More details are described in the model Grant Agreement available in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP)."

The overall objective of this action is to create European partnerships of teacher education and training providers to set
up Erasmus+ Teacher Academies that will develop a European and international outlook in teacher education. These
Academies will embrace multilingualism, language awareness and cultural diversity, develop teacher education in line
with the EU’s priorities in education policy and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the European
Education Area.

The Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will meet the following objectives:

 Contribute to the improvement of teacher education policies and practices in Europe by creating networks and
communities of practice on teacher education that bring together providers of initial teacher education (preservice
education for future teachers) and providers of continuing professional development (in-service), other
relevant actors such as teacher associations, ministries and stakeholders to develop and test strategies and
programmes for professional learning that is effective, accessible and transferable to other contexts.

 Enhance the European dimension and internationalisation of teacher education through innovative and
practical collaboration with teacher educators and teachers in other European countries and by sharing
experiences for the further development of teacher education in Europe. This collaboration will address the
key priorities of the European Union such as learning in the digital world, sustainability, equity and inclusion,
also by offering teachers courses, modules and other learning opportunities on these topics.

 Develop and test jointly different models of mobility (virtual, physical and blended) in initial teacher
education and as part of teachers’ continuous professional development in order to enhance the quality and
number of mobility as well as to make mobility an integral part of teacher education provision in Europe.

 Develop sustainable collaboration between teacher education providers with an impact to the quality of
teacher education in Europe and with a view to inform teacher education polices at European and national
levels."

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes:
Design of preparedness actions linking together multilevel interventions that need to involve citizens, communities, business organisations, public administrations for empowering citizens and their communities to act by themselves together with emergency services and managing spontaneous volunteers in the case of a disaster or crisis-related emergency of any kind (natural hazards, including pandemics, or man-made including terrorist threats) in the form of best practices and guidelines exploiting local resources (knowledge, networks, tools) developed with practitioners and local decision-makers.
Development of effective means for communication improving inter-organisational collaborative processes e.g. early warning systems and communication chains, roles, tasks and responsibilities of citizens, communities, local authorities, NGOs, business companies and practitioners, taking into account the legal framework, procedures for normal operation and organizational boundaries.
Improved early warning systems, forecasts and strategies to reach different public representatives with proper messages in the event of a disaster.
Demonstration exercises involving citizens, training and educational institutions, local decision-makers, employees in public administrations and in business companies, and practitioners, to identify practices, test guidelines and communication strategies in near-real-case situations in the framework of field exercises, virtual trainings and serious gaming, school / university curricula and professional training.
Building a ‘culture of disaster preparedness’ for citizens, communities, public administrations, business companies, practitioners: Development of an effective education system and integration of theory and practice of preparedness in school curricula; development of an effective integration of multilevel action in public administration (at local and regional national and international levels) focusing also on responsibility and deliberation issues; development of effective preparedness practices for citizens, communities, business organisations and practitioners (and their associations).
Deployment of evidence-based assessment methods/models to monitor and strengthen emergency preparedness.
Scope:
Improving societal resilience to disasters or crises relies on various features related to preparedness of citizens, communities, education systems, public administrations, business companies and practitioners. These concern, in particular, ways to react and informed decisions to take in case of an event. Individual, public and multi-level actions are needed in disaster risk management and they have huge implications on potentially reducing losses and increasing the operational capacity of responders, along with significant impacts on the emergency planning and management phases and its relation to continuous operations and existing safety management. In particular, the level of awareness of EU citizens of the risks in their region is an indicator for measuring progress in increasing public awareness and preparedness for disasters and in the implementation of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism legislation.
Besides the required risk understanding dealt with in topic CL3-2021-DRS-01-01, research is needed in several domains. With regard to public administrations, it is relevant to conceptualise how to increase risk awareness by building processes capable of fostering a long-lasting coalition with citizens around the objective of reducing vulnerability. This implies the definition of action protocols and models of responsibility that mobilise the intervention of individual employees of public administrations. With regard to business companies and practitioners, it is relevant to integrate their emergency activities in the local context. With regard to citizens and communities, it is necessary to design preparedness actions enabling an empowerment of citizens (including particularly vulnerable groups), their communities and NGOs through bottom-up participatory and learning processes. This includes school/university curricula and professional training and trust building among local actors, integrating relevant traditional knowledge, incorporating a gender perspective where relevant, best practices, guidelines, and possible changes of regulations, to allow participatory actions. Difficulties in communication to the public in preparedness (and response) phases requires the consideration of legal aspects, along with investigations into innovative practices, forms and tools that will enable the more effective sharing of information, taking into account possible risks of disinformation and fake news. These will support citizens in acting efficiently by themselves, through enhanced collaboration and communication and improving information exchanges between local authorities (including first and second responders), vulnerable populations (e.g. socio-economic groups, ethnic groups, people with illnesses or disabilities, children, elderly, hospital patients), and the private sector.
Moreover, recent crises have shown that there is a large sense of solidarity among the population during a disaster or crisis situation. Many citizens that were not involved in disaster relief organisations before the crisis want to offer support to their fellow citizens and the broader community in times of crises. These initiatives of “spontaneous volunteers” are however most efficient if they are informed and trained and if their valuable contributions are coordinated with the authorities and first and second responders on the ground. Preparedness plans, tests and continued adaption on how best to manage spontaneous volunteers and integrate those into the response are needed.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.

","23 November 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes:
Increased understanding of high impact-low probability events in the short and medium term, both from natural and man-made hazards. These perspectives include cultural, societal, regional, ethical and historical contexts. This should capture new and emerging risks and develop end-user-friendly tools for risk assessors to conceptualise such risks.
Improved methods/tools for decision-making under uncertainty to prepare for high-impact low-probability events. These methods could include the impact of past events, communication and linguistic components, and regional specificities. These should be developed in close cooperation with end users to maximise application of these tools in practice.
Better preparedness for and management of high-impact low-probability risks that most, if not all, experts have difficulty conceptualising (the unexpected events), including by developing no-regret options that can address different kinds of impacts irrespective of the cause.
Improved mapping of i) socioeconomic systems’ interdependencies that can be negatively affected by high-impact low-probability events, and ii) which systems contribute to the materialisation of high-impact low-probability risks by increasing societal vulnerability. This would be supported by identification of interventions where resilience-building would be most effective. This identification could be based on an in-depth understanding of past events, a mapping of the current societies’ cultural sensibilities in a geographical space / region context, and/or their ethical and legal contexts.
Improved preparedness at an individual level, at local level and at the governmental level, including through clarifying roles and responsibilities around management of high-impact low-probability events. An improved understanding of existing risk and resilience management capacities across Europe at national and regional levels for responding to high-impact low-probability risks that Europe may face.
Development of appropriate simulation tools to identify areas under higher risk of occurrence of HILP events and development of preparedness plans and management mechanisms, including communication, to address the effects of such occurrence.
Combination of qualitative and quantitative approach strategies, which encompass practical and probabilistic knowledge to increase the success rate of identifying and adequately monitoring fast developing risks into potential high-impact low-probability events
Multi-disciplinary reference library around HILP events and their impacts would allow to build up a record of observations that can help quantify the impacts and, by analogy, similar risks that might arise in the future.
Scenario-building exercises and stress-test risk-related practices in critical infrastructure sectors (e.g., transport, communications, energy) would enhance preparedness and help identify particularly affected social groups while enabling rapid financial and practical support where national organizations are unable to cope or where the consequences are cross-border in nature. Independent, high-quality hubs (national or regional) for up-to-date risk notification and provision of scientific information and communication in a crisis – supported by governments, businesses and industry associations.
Scope:
The risk landscape has changed significantly over the last decades. With new and emerging risks and risk magnifiers such as climate change, cyber threats, infectious diseases and terrorism, countries need to anticipate and prepare for the unexpected and difficult to predict.
At European level, there is, however, no agreed definition nor methodology to characterise HILP and unexpected events, resulting in differing impact scales and a lack of comparability of risk ratings among National Risk Assessments. High-impact, low-probability risks (HILP/Hi-Lo) can be understood as “events or occurrences that cannot easily be anticipated, arise randomly and unexpectedly, and have immediate effects and significant impacts”. They can manifest themselves not only as one-off high-profile crises and mega-disasters (e.g., Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident, eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, 9/11 terrorist attack in the U.S. and COVID-19 pandemic) but also as lower-profile, persistent events with equally serious impacts such as flooding, droughts and cyclones which, owing to the low likelihood of occurrence or the high cost of mitigating action, remain un- or under-prepared for.
High-impact, low-probability events (HILP) and their cascading effects raise many challenges for governments, businesses and decision-makers, including defining where the responsibilities lie in preparing for both individual shocks and slow-motion trends (e.g. global warming, tipping points, sea level rise) that tend to increase their magnitude and frequency. A 2019 revision of Decision 1313/2013/EU on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism has brought attention to high impact low probability risks and events, now requiring Member States to take prevention and preparedness measures to address them where appropriate, and the EU fully financing capacities through rescEU to respond to high impact low probability events.
To get the right balance between planning for specific ‘known’ events and creating generic responses for events that are rare or unexpected, research should support the anticipation and management of shock events through improving planning processes, establishing broader risk-uncertainty frameworks that capture such events, enhancing business resilience and responses to shocks, and stepping up communications in a crisis.
Preparing for and managing the consequences of a HILP event will benefit firstly from developing an increased understanding of new and emerging risks, besides the required risk understanding dealt with in topics CL3-2021-DRS-01-01 and CL3-2021-DRS-01-02, and in close connection to them. Improved methods should also be sought to support risk assessors and decision-makers in conceptualising these risks and developing no-regret options to manage them. A thorough understanding of existing risk management capacities across Europe at national and regional levels for responding to high-impact low-probability risks that Europe may face would contribute to improving preparedness at the European level to risks that can affect multiple countries at once and overwhelm national response capacities. Finally, enhancing preparedness for and management of high impact low-probability events cannot happen without an increased resilience of individuals. In close connection to topic CL3-2021-DRS-01-02, research is also needed on how to prepare citizens for unfamiliar risks and what information to disseminate, and how to communicate, during the disaster or crisis-related emergency in order to manage panic, confusion and threats of disinformation.
Given the practical nature of this topic, co-design, co-development, co-dissemination and co-evaluation of the research outputs engaging the intended end users will be particularly important.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Increased European common forensic investigation capabilities and cross-border exchanges thanks to a better understanding of main organisational cultures and of human interactions in the forensic context, and of the main causes of biases in interpretation and reasoning;
Strengthened bridges between different actors in an investigative process through an improved non-ambiguous communication and enhanced communication mechanisms at all levels;
Improved European common forensics investigation capabilities and cross-border exchanges thanks to a common, modern lexicon that is used by forensic institutes and Police Authorities, validated against practitioners' needs and requirements, to facilitate their (specialised) daily work on investigating terrorism and other forms of serious crime;
Development of safer justice outcomes through an increased understanding of how human interactions impacts on decisions at all levels of an investigative process;
Modern and robust methods of reasoning and of experts’ decision making in forensic practice, overcoming various types of biases;
Forensic institutes and Police Authorities active in crime scene investigations benefit from innovation education and training curricula.
Scope:
Security research projects related to forensics typically focus only on technologies and data, while the process by which forensic experts evaluate and interpret the evidence is often put aside. However, cognitive methods and human judgement play a significant role as forensic experts observe and interpret the data. By doing this, forensic experts are almost inevitably exposed to irrelevant contextual information (such as suspect’s criminal record or ethnicity, a type of the information that can be obtained due to a liaison between a forensic expert and investigators, police and the prosecution), which can potentially cause bias. In contexts where digital technologies are involved in creating forensic outcomes, biases and loss of transparency can also arise from different roles and disciplinary backgrounds of the different actors working on and with the digital tools. Communication between practitioners within the same institute can introduce a bias as well. When exchanging the information cross-border, both organisational cultures and languages can also cause a bias.
Understanding how human interaction, both internally and in the European context, impacts on decisions at all levels of an investigative process is critical for the development of safe justice outcomes. In forensic practice, it is crucial to understand the impacts of various types of biases on interpretation and reasoning, and to develop methods to increase the robustness of reasoning and of experts’ decision making. Research is needed to evaluate, develop and enhance methods and cognitive techniques to communicate non-ambiguously in the forensic and legal context, as well as to develop, improve and enhance communication mechanisms between the actors of the criminal justice chain.
That being said, in the European context, a critical enabler for an improved collaboration and communication between forensic practitioners is the use of a clear, consistent vocabulary. Such a shared vocabulary would, among others, allow for a common understanding of forensics, improve structured (cross-border) data sharing, and amplify the (cross-border) acceptance of evidence in court. There is hence a need for a development of a common lexicon, able to adapt to the evolving aspect of forensic technologies.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
Enhanced knowledge on the use of online gaming culture and structure by violent extremists as well as their modus operandi through video game chatrooms, used as their recruitment tools;
European Police Authorities benefit from better, innovative and validated tools and training curricula (which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data) to tackle violent radicalisation through online gaming culture;
Increased awareness of citizens about online radicalisation through gaming culture;
Enhanced protection of youth in the gaming environment against recruitment into violent radicalisation;
Improved shared understanding and cooperation between different actors involved, including security practitioners, gaming industry, social media, video game hosting services and civil society;
Improved shaping and tuning by security policy-makers of regulation on preventing abuse of online gaming culture by violent extremists.
Scope:
A highly increasingly influencing societal issue related to radicalisation is the online gaming culture. Earlier studies have shown no link between video games and violence. However, terrorism and gaming experts claim that forums and chatrooms are used as recruitment tools. Research is needed to analyse the use of online gaming culture and structure by violent extremists as well as their modus operandi through video game chatrooms and forums.
Regarding video games themselves, an in-depth analysis is needed on how the type of the video game, of its theme, design, aesthetics etc. plays a role in the choice of the chatroom to be used as a recruitment area. As far as video game chatrooms, including social media platforms discussing video games, are concerned, dissemination strategies of violent extremists through them as well as their ways of grooming should be analysed.
Based on the results of these analyses, innovative (societal) means of fighting this type of crime, both online and offline, should be developed. The role of Police Authorities in this respect should be analysed. Possibilities of detecting and investigating this type of crime should be discussed as well, with a focus on legal and ethical aspects. Modern and effective awareness raising campaigns should be developed, that would target young people, parents, school teachers, video-gaming industry and wide communities, and that take into account the European multicultural dimension. Methods for evaluating proposed solutions should be developed as well. Suggestions to gaming industry on which traps to avoid when designing and upgrading a video game should be provided too.
Proposed activities should take into account the evolving nature of this type of crime and of technology, and be performed while respecting the applicable legislation and fundamental rights, such as privacy and protection of personal data. Societal dimension should be in the core of proposed activities, with a support of technologies. The consortia should consist in Police Authorities, representatives of gaming industry, gaming experts, IT specialists, (cyber) psychologists and sociologists. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. Participation of relevant Civil Society Organisations or gaming communities would be an added value. Analysis of the possible applications of research results to other similar problems (e.g. child sexual abuse) is welcome.
Coordination with successful proposals under topic HORIZON-CL2-DEMOCRACY-2022-01-04 (Evolution of political extremism and its influence on contemporary social and political dialogue) should be envisaged so as to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

","23 November 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects’ results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Improved understanding by local authorities, operators and policy makers of the effect of large-scale surveillance of public spaces on the behaviour of citizens and possible negative effects on local communities;
Enhanced transparency for citizens on different forms of surveillance by Police Authorities[1], local authorities and private actors in public spaces, and increased awareness of applicable rights towards operators of such systems;
Improved protection of public spaces without the need for 24/7 data collection and storage;
Set of common standards and good practices by local authorities, operators and policy makers for internal access restriction, anonymization and data minimization allowing a proportionate use of already installed surveillance-systems (such as CCTV) in public spaces, reducing the risk of misuse of collected data and respecting fundamental rights, especially the protection of personal data.
Scope:
In recent years, the number of different tools for the surveillance of public spaces has been growing at massive pace in most European cities. CCTV-systems in public spaces are the most evident examples. They have been expanded in terms of quantity (number of CCTV in public spaces, such as squares, streets or touristic sites), quality (improved solution of images, possibility of tracking and automatic pattern-recognition) and also scope (CCTV present in areas like parks, 24/7 recording as standard due to higher data storage capacities).
CCTV-systems are the most evident and visible, although by far not the only ones. Acoustic sensors, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and in the future possibly widespread facial recognition add to a system of sensors that cover large parts of public spaces in many European cities.
While evidence suggests that such tools can help to combat certain forms of crime an increase the perceived security of citizens, the significant expansion of areas that are monitored risks to create negative effects for the right for privacy. Scientific studies indicate that also legal forms of behaviour are adapted by persons, which are aware that they are monitored by surveillance systems. Furthermore, there is evidence that such systems are often concentrated in socially deprived districts, creating the risks of stigmatisation of its residents.
In terms of crime prevention there are indications that for many settings, sensors like CCTV are in the best case only part of a solution and they can create a tendency of reducing personnel on the ground, thus limiting the possibilities for classical policing and reducing the direct interaction between local police and public order services and the citizens. Such interaction is however key to address crime prevention and response to criminal threats in a holistic manner.
The quantitative growth of both public and private surveillance has led to the fact that nowadays, citizens are hardly able to keep track of where their data has been captured and thus not able to make us of their rights as guaranteed by applicable legislation, such as the GDPR. While citizens as subjects of the surveillance are becoming transparent towards public and private operators of surveillance, the operators themselves remain in many cases inaccessible and few technological innovations are used to make sure only relevant data is stored and processed.
While significant industry and research resources are invested in the design of new and the upgrading of existing surveillance systems for public spaces, innovation could be stimulated to look for alternatives. Such alternative could identify means to protect public spaces though enhanced interaction with local communities, re-design sensors as to ensure they capture data in the most proportionate way, increase transparency for citizens towards public and private operators of surveillance systems and finally explore privacy-friendly technological features to ensure that only relevant data is kept, processed and accessible by authorised actors. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Responsible Research and Innovation[2] could be a relevant approach for the involvement of diverse stakeholders, launching debates, and co-developing or even implementing solutions.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

Enhanced ability of security practitioners to detect victims of all forms of exploitation, taking into account consistent patterns, and identify victims at an early stage;
Enhanced ability of security practitioners to prevent the emergence of organised crime networks related to trafficking in human beings, to disrupt the trafficking chain at an early stage, deter organised crime groups related to trafficking in human beings and respond to the threat of existing organisations, as well as their potential expansion via de use of social media;
Improved strategies of cooperation applied by European Police and Border Guards Authorities in fighting trafficking in human beings and dismantling related criminal networks, while respecting fundamental rights such as the protection of personal data, and improved cooperation between European and origin and transit countries authorities;
Better policy-making related to the fight against trafficking in human beings.
Scope:
Trafficking in human beings is a serious and organised form of crime that involves the criminal exploitation of vulnerable people, the goal of which is the economic gain. This crime is often cross-border and consistently the vast majority of its victims are women and girls, around one fourth of all victims being children. Around half of the victims are EU nationals within the EU.
Trafficking can take place for various exploitation purposes, including sexual exploitation, forced labour, servitude, removal of organs, forced criminality (e.g., pickpocketing or drug trafficking). Trafficking in human beings is a grave violation of people’s fundamental rights and dignity, and is explicitly prohibited by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Understanding the nature, scale and costs of the crime is key to ensuring appropriate action at the European level to prevent the phenomenon. The 2017 Communication (COM(2017) 728 final) identifies as key priorities: to address the culture of impunity via disrupting the business model of criminals and untangling the trafficking chain; to provide a better access to and realise the rights of victims; to intensify a coordinated and consolidate response within and outside the EU.
Innovation, reliable and comprehensive statistics are crucial in obtaining a complete intelligence picture of this crime, the modus operandi of the related criminal groups, identifying and addressing trends, developing evidence-based policy, and measuring the impact of individual initiatives. Innovative intelligence-based technological means of detecting, tracking and disrupting the online activities related to trafficking in human beings (including darknet) should be developed as well. The proposed activities would also aim to contribute to countering the culture of impunity by increasing the capacity of Police Authorities to detect the trafficking crime, the suspected perpetrators and the victims and to disrupt the business model and/or establish responsibility of all those involved in the trafficking chain.
Activities proposed within this topic should address both societal and technological dimensions of trafficking in human beings in a balanced way, taking care of the applicable EU legal and policy framework including fundamental rights and ethics. Since the international dimension of this crime should be analysed as well, both Police and Border Guards Authorities should be involved in the consortia, in order to tackle effectively all aspects of this crime, such as finding together means of disrupting the human traffickers’ business model. Collaboration with Police Authorities, security practitioners and Border Guards Authorities from countries of origin or transit of criminal networks would be an added value.

Security practitioners and policy-makers are provided with improved and complete intelligence picture of corruption, such as modus operandi, both offline and online, including cross-border dimension, new trends, its social and economic impact, its role in enabling other types of crime, as well as its close links with money laundering;
A comprehensive risk analysis is provided to security practitioners and policy makers on the new opportunities offered by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of corruptive practices, cross-border dimension, its social and economic impact and sectors at high risk;

Improved strategies of cooperation between European Police and Border Guards Authorities in fighting corruption and dismantling related criminal networks;
Improved policy-making related to the fight against corruption.
Scope:
Corruption, a criminal category that ranges from bribery of public officials via sports to abuse of power and money laundering of proceeds from crime, is a strong enabler for crime and terrorism, and, as such, it constitutes a threat to security. By creating business uncertainty, slowing processes, and imposing additional costs, it has a negative impact on economic growth.
Although the nature and scope of corruption may differ from one Member State to another, it harms the whole Europe by lowering investment levels, hampering the fair operation of the Internal Market and reducing public finances.
The points where innovative solutions can help are threefold. Firstly, there is a need to estimate the impact of corruption. It refers to social impact, factors that promote or hinder it, impact on vulnerable groups, economic, as well as fiscal and development costs.
Secondly, the role of corruption as an enabler of other crimes deserves analysis as well. Namely, corruption, increasingly facilitated by online services, is a fertile ground for organised criminal activities (human trafficking, smuggling…) and terrorism. For some criminal activities, corruption is an integral part of their modus operandi. Thus, relations with other types of crime should be explored too. Money laundering, closely linked to corruption, deserves special attention.
Thirdly, innovative societal and technological solutions for prevention, detection and investigation of this type of crime are needed, including also the collection of cross-border court-proof evidence. Therefore, activities proposed within this topic should address both societal and technological dimensions of corruption in a balanced way, taking care of the applicable legislation and fundamental rights. The international dimension should be analysed as well, hence both Police and Border Guards Authorities should be involved in the consortia, in order to tackle effectively all aspects of this crime.

The notions of ‘smart citizens’ and ‘smart local communities’ empowered by Responsible Research and Innovation and social innovation, where the general public co-control safety and security of their environments, are more widely adopted by decision makers;
New benchmarks, standards or other quality criteria are established for developing security solutions through Responsible Research and Innovation[1];
Increased collaboration across all parts of the quadruple helix (academia/research, public authorities, industry/SMEs, civil society/citizens/local communities) to develop innovations in line with the needs, values and expectations of society;
Innovative, transferable and potentially scalable technological solutions co-created with citizens and local communities in social labs and innovation living hubs, and citizens empowered to act as generators, validators and end-users of the new horizontal technologies;
Societal trust in security research products, their desired usefulness and social acceptability[2];
Scope:
Citizens and local communities are insufficiently involved in the co-creation of socially innovative processes to develop security solutions and thus conceptions of what citizens and local communities know and think about security could be predominantly shaped by media coverage. This might result in bias in the assessment of the seriousness and probability of different security threats. Nevertheless, social acceptance of security technology depends on understanding citizens’ awareness of security problems and threats. Comprehensive discussion that involves citizens from all parts of society directly in co-design such as through Responsible Research and Innovation and social innovation, alongside other security technology actors, would integrate public concerns beyond incident-based interpretations of security threats, thereby increasing social acceptance of security technology and subjective feelings and perceptions of personal security in daily life. At the same time, industry would be in a position to identify new business opportunities in producing and delivering security products and services, which are in line with needs, values and expectations of citizens and local communities and support their well-being.
Social innovations[3] for increasing security and security perception can be manifold and the scope of application of social innovation is potentially wide-ranging and can address diverse aspects. For example, apps that help citizens to prevent, detect and respond with first responders in disaster and crisis situation and to access real-time information about adequate responses; the formation of networks of parents of children who are considered susceptible to extreme ideologies to establish early warning and early-intervention mechanisms. What these examples have in common is that they give citizens an active role in co-creation and produce a practical use value.
Giving more emphasis on a co-creation procedure from the design phase could also overcome the corresponding lack of knowledge about how socially innovative solutions can contribute to increased security and security perception. Although citizens and local communities can successfully support as co-designers and beneficiaries to replicate and upscale best practices as well as systemic and cross-sectorial solutions that combine technological, digital, social and nature-based innovation, existing knowledge of such contributions is limited. Therefore, proposals should develop a societal development plan that builds upon a people-centred approach and examines how social innovations on security are organised, how they work, how and why they are adopted or rejected, their direct and indirect benefits and costs, including in vulnerability assessments, how they sustain, and which interfaces with other more formal security agents are established.
Proposals should map and analyse a social innovation in one or more distinct social spheres, in areas such as:
(a) Security disturbance at large (pop-) cultural and sports events;
(b) Security and security behaviour in public places, public transport or mobility;
(c) Radicalisation, dis-integration in local communities and social media;
(d) Digital identity, data portability and data minimisation with an attribute based society in control;
(e) Safety and security in remote communication, command and control of operation in risk scenarios;
(f) Mobilisation on human trafficking;
(g) Automatic detections’ use.
Proposals should consider the social relevance of research, social marketing, transferability and scaling of such social innovations as this is an area where there is limited research and experimentation, which could help to spread the use of such solutions. They should also consider education, training and change individual behavioural and social practices by involving citizens and local communities as generators, validators and end-users of the new horizontal/advanced technologies.
Proposals which have developed innovative ideas on societal resilience under the Destination Disaster-Resilient Society and which can transform them into social innovations for disaster crisis situations engaging citizens and local communities are not pre-empted to participate in this topic.
Consortia should give meaningful roles to all research and innovation actors, including security practitioners, system developers, the public sector, technology development organisations, civil society organisations[4], communication specialists on security research, researchers and Social Sciences and Humanities Experts from a variety of EU Member States and Associated Countries. In order to ensure a meaningful democratic oversight of the EU’s security research programme, projects and policies at national and European level, proposals should establish a multidisciplinary approach and have the appropriate balance of industry, representatives of citizens and local communities and social sciences and humanities experts.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
As indicated in the introduction of this call, project proposals should foresee resources for clustering activities with other successful proposals in the same or other calls, to find synergies, and identify best practices, and to develop close working relationships with other Programmes (e.g. the Civil Society Empowerment Programme (CSEP-ISF), Science with and for Society (SwafS), the Digital Europe Programme).
The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 4 years.

Social Innovation
[1]Responsible research and innovation is a process for better aligning research and innovation with the values, needs and expectations of society. It implies close cooperation between all stakeholders in various strands comprising science education, definition of research agendas, access to research results and the application of new knowledge in full compliance with gender and ethics considerations. Outcome of the Council Meeting 3353rd Council meeting Competitiveness (Internal Market, Industry, Research and Space) Brussels, 4 and 5 December 2014, p. 13.
[2]Social acceptance is seen as the process by which innovation becomes embedded in everyday practices, that needs to be supported by good design and creative, inclusive design methods. It enables a focus on enhancing the acceptability of solutions. This may imply careful attention to usability and the context of appropriation as it may require wider systemic change and will often depend on stakeholder value chain mapping, and methods of collaborative design and responsible research and innovation to which reference is made.
[3]“Social innovation can be defined as innovations that are social both as to their means and in particular those which relate to the development and implementation of new ideas (concerning products, services and models), that simultaneously meet social needs and create new social collaborations, thereby benefiting society and boosting its capacity to act""; European Commission Bureau of European Policy Advisors, BEPA, 2011, p. 9
The co-legislators adopted the BEPA definition two years later in Regulation (EU) No 1296/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on a European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (""EaSI"") and amending Decision No 283/2010/EU establishing a European Progress Microfinance Facility for employment and social inclusion, Article 2, paragraph 5.

","30 June 2022
","23 November 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced analytical capacity to support the programming of EU-funded security research and capacity building funds through a periodic and timely evidence-based policy feedback ;
Periodically aggregated and consolidated view of the capability needs and gaps in the thematic areas under consideration[1];
Periodically aggregated and consolidated view of the state-of-the-art technologies, techniques, methods and tools that can contribute to fill the identified capability gaps;
Periodically aggregated and consolidated view of outcomes (including on technological, industrial, legal and ethical issues), future trends, lessons learnt and best practices derived from past and current security research effort incurred in the thematic areas under consideration.
More systematic assessment and validation of the outcomes of EU-funded security research projects with respect to identified capability gaps through harmonised support mechanisms;
Common and updated map of opportunities and constraints for the exploitation of EU security research and innovation projects, with special focus on industrialisation, commercialisation, adoption and deployment of innovative solutions in response to common capability gaps;
Common and updated map of areas requiring standardised solutions and/or certification schemes to foster innovation uptake and market creation, as well as trainings and options for the implementation of such schemes.
Enhanced cooperation between research institutions, smaller private research agencies, security practitioners, SMEs and community representatives to support integrated participation in requirements determination and analysis, research and validation and evaluation of results.
Scope:
Innovation uptake is not a linear process, and even less a single-step process that happens only at the end of a research project and it is not automatically enabled by a successful research result. The innovation uptake process begins with the identification of a need and ends with an innovative solution deployed on the field of operations, being R&I only one of the many contributors to the overall process, but not the first and not the last. In other words, successful results of research projects are a necessary but not sufficient condition to guarantee the uptake of innovation.
Investment in security research needs to be designed taking into consideration how and when it can deliver outcomes that contribute to the development of security capabilities. Therefore, research needs to be undertaken, from its very early stages, in a way that addresses real needs while guaranteeing the impact in the final solutions. It should also ensure to identify and underpin the factors that could help in the implementation of its results. However, the programming of research is highly conditioned by the quality, reliability and timeliness of the evidence that supports its decision making process. This includes the identification and understanding of the contextual elements that can or will influence or be influenced by the research (process), the research team and the research projects themselves.
The European Commission and the EU Member States carry out this programming exercise periodically, taking into account a wide variety of inputs. The complexity of the challenge is notable, considering that the EU security landscape is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous in what regards the security threats, the capabilities required to face them, the evolution of modern technologies, and the skillset needed to deploy those. In order to carry out a sound programming exercise, the European Commission and the EU Member States strive to consult and involve all actors. With that aim, experts are gathered in different configurations and their inputs are coordinated at EU and national levels to be factored in by the decision-making bodies of EU-funded security research.
These experts require high quality, reliable and timely evidence to support their assessments, but information is often scattered, hardly visible and requires bespoke processing for the detection of patterns and for the generation of actionable intelligence. In other cases, it is simply not presented in the right format to unveil its value.
Applicants are invited to submit proposals for the establishment of Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation. The role of these networks is to collect, aggregate, process, disseminate and exploit the existing knowledge to directly contribute to the expected outcomes of this topic.
Networks must engage with the main sources of information in order to have a sound and updated picture of the aspects mentioned above. This includes interaction with security experts (beyond the members of the project consortium), organisations, projects or initiatives, but also an extensive review of available databases, studies, reports or literature (notably all information generated under the EU-funded security research programmes, and possibly under other EU or MS funding programmes).
The networks have to ensure the dissemination and exploitation of their findings to the different communities of the security research ecosystem, including policy makers, security authorities, industry, researchers and citizens. Special emphasis needs to be made on the contribution of these networks to the work of entities and initiatives established by the European Commission and the EU Agencies (e.g. Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network) to contribute to the security research programming effort. In this regard, the networks have to contribute timely and intensively to the work of the Thematic Working Groups of the Community of Users for Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies (future CERIS –Community of European Research and Innovation for Security) and of other equivalent innovation labs/groups set-up by EU Agencies (e.g. EUROPOL). The networks will have to contribute to these working groups with the quantitative and qualitative evidence required to carry out their activities in support to a more impactful EU-funded Security R&I and to a more frequent and systematic innovation uptake.
Each proposal should include a plan, and a budget amounting at least 25% of the total cost of the action to interact with industry, academia and other providers of innovative solutions outside the consortium, with a view to assessing the feasibility of their findings, give support in validation processes, promote competitive development (e.g. via prizes) or dissemination of results, among other options.
The networks must be in a position to deliver findings on the abovementioned challenges starting from the month 6 of the project and periodically every 6 months or less, in accordance with the information needs of the entities and initiatives they are contributing to.
Proposals should clearly describe the process and timing for the collection of inputs and the generation of outcomes. This plan should go beyond the description of project deliverables and milestones, and describe in detail how and when the findings will be disseminated and exploited during the project and in collaboration with the communities described above.
The consortia submitting the proposals should ensure sufficient representativeness of the communities of interest (including, but not only, geographical representativeness) and a balanced coverage in terms of knowledge and skills of the different knowledge domains required to face the challenge, including security operations, technologies, research & innovation, industry, market, etc. The applying consortia should demonstrate how the project beneficiaries guarantee the expertise required to steer the project activities in all the knowledge domains to ensure the success of the action. The work of the partners should be supported by solid and recognised tools and methods, also accompanied by the required expertise to put them in practice.
The networks should build to the extent possible on the work initiated by the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes. Should such networks be still ongoing, maximum cooperation and minimum overlapping should be ensured and demonstrated.
Under this call, the applicants are invited to propose networks on the thematic areas of:
Option A: Disaster Resilience
Option B: Fighting Crime and Terrorism.
The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 3 years.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

","26 May 2022
","27 October 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Meeting local and seasonal energy demands in agriculture and forestry with optimum agricultural and forest waste management and use while reducing the associated emissions is essential. If not managed, agricultural waste is often burnt in the fields and forests suffer from fires, thus increasing the environmental footprint of agriculture and forests. Soil and biodiversity improvement in agriculture could also benefit from renewable energy technologies. Demonstrating incorporation of renewable energy technologies to attain heat, waste and land management needs in agricultural and forestry will contribute to increase the penetration of renewable sources in the energy system and enable transformation of the energy supply across critical energy-consuming sectors, thus accelerating the achievement of the European Green Deal and climate and energy targets for 2030 and of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, while supporting the EU goals for energy independence and economic growth. Furthermore, it will support achieving the specific objective of the post 2020 Common Agricultural Policy[1] regarding contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as sustainable energy.
Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Promote decentralised renewable energy use and cost-efficient decentralized production of renewable energy carriers.
Reduce agriculture and forestry carbon footprint from own energy consumption and agricultural/forest waste management.
Increase sustainability and circularity in agriculture while creating positive effects on biodiversity.
Increase sustainability and circularity in forestry.
Foster regional development in rural areas.
Support farmers’ and foresters’ engagement as prosumers of renewable energy.
Scope:
Proposals should demonstrate incorporation of renewable energy technologies in agriculture or forestry to meet its electricity, heat, cold, waste and land management needs. Solutions should combine innovative renewable, circular and regional value chains from different renewables and adapted storage options to de-fossilize agricultural or forest processes trans-seasonally, taking into account hybridization compatibility. They should also address one of the two options:
Transformation of agricultural or forest wastes to renewable energy carriers in situ, e.g. by modular slow pyrolysis units, using renewable energy for process energy needs. Solutions should improve the cost-effectiveness and the sustainability of agriculture or forest seasonal energy demand based on renewables.
Development of renewable-based agricultural protocols for multiple and cover cropping and/ or mixed cropping which increase carbon sequestration and soil organic matter and reduce pesticides, combined with transformation to renewable energy carriers in situ, e.g. by biogas production, in a circular approach for soil nutrients and carbon. Positive effects on soil biodiversity/soil health and soil functionality as regards increasing soil organic matter, phosphorus and other nutrients and reducing the risk on groundwater contamination from nitrogen oxides should be assessed. Solutions should improve the cost-effectiveness and the sustainability (including biodiversity) of agricultural waste and land management through valorisation of wastes and secondary crops based on renewable energy technologies.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Assess the contribution of proposed solutions to the enhancement of smart readiness of buildings as rated by the smart readiness indicator under Directive 2010/31/EU.
Where relevant, rely on advanced monitoring and management solutions such as those that integrate digital models / BIM with energy modelling and simulation at building level and district level.
Implement and demonstrate innovative and competitive balancing, storage and generation services in buildings, while maximising building users’ and occupants’ health, comfort and satisfaction.
Demonstrate cost-effectiveness and economic viability of the proposed solutions and underlying business models for both consumers / end-users and the economic actors involved.
Demonstrate the use of large-scale interoperable platforms that bring together different actors and sectors (ESCOs, aggregators, DSOs, etc.) to exchange data and develop services.
Seek to involve major European innovators, including social innovators, in relevant fields (demand response, communications, smart appliances, building services, facility management, energy services, etc.) with limited experience of Horizon 2020.

Optimal mix distribution of land uses both in city centres and peripheries looking at the preferred rationales for achieving the best combination of residential, commercial, leisure and industrial space to reach the most sustainable mobility patterns according to the available and future transport supply and demand.[3]
Improved local authority capacity in the managing and collection of data, estimation and measurements of the impacts achieved by new measures and if a regulation is needed to ensure this happening.
Valorisation of data and information gathered from urban freight to better understand the impact of long-haul deliveries and e-commerce on the city as “just in time” deliveries are producing longer and more trips with more and emptier vehicles, leading to more congestion, air and noise pollution, Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and road risk in urban areas.
Optimise the potential mix of strategically positioned land, owned by public authorities (unused railway tracks and marshalling yards, real estate, parking) or by logistics service providers in urban areas, for developing a comprehensive policy strategy integrating transport, logistics and land use. The scope of this exercise includes the roll-out of new modes and increasing use of sustainable modes (waterways and rail). Better understand the impact of increasing transport and logistics patterns on the climate and environment, resilience and robustness of the transport network and the urban infrastructure. This exercise addresses as well the increasing impact of new modes, (electric assisted) cargo bicycles, light electric freight vehicles (LEFV) and vehicles on alternative fuels.
Optimize shared transport facilities for goods through smart solutions.
Improved space management and urban planning focusing on the “new normal” after the Covid-19 pandemic considering how cities are optimising their planning and allocation of space.
Demonstrate and deploy economically viable and sustainable solutions driven by relevant technologies (e.g. real-time traffic information, space management, floating car data) and demonstrate the convenience of consolidation, consistent with the full planning of loading and unloading spaces, to deliver the services and the goods.
New or upgraded sustainable urban logistics plan that includes the main stakeholders (cities, logistics operators, couriers, postal services, real estate and/or retail industries) and addresses to a minimum: development of safe and sustainable logistics and delivery models in cities, low emission zones, data collection and usage, consolidation and space management, clean and alternative vehicles, stakeholders dialogue, e-commerce.
Scope:
How urban space is being used and allocated can influence congestion, noise, road risk, air quality, GHG emissions as well as liveability. At the same time there is a gap for purpose-oriented freight data collection in cities to support their decision making towards sustainability targets such as climate neutrality, air quality, road safety reducing congestion and better use of public space.
Proposals should consider dynamic space re-allocation for the integration of urban freight at local level and the impacts of how urban space is being used as well as the optimal mix of space distribution and of land uses. Proposals should analyse the potential of strategically positioned urban (or peri-urban) spaces to develop and implement a pilot demonstration, (but without interfering with parks, trees or other recreational green areas). The aim is to reduce the impact of freight transport and logistics on the urban fabric.
Projects could consider involving real estate companies, logistics service providers, together with cities, to develop sustainable business models for open and clean hubs/consolidation spaces in cities (for example using/sharing existing private locations such as underground private parking, office buildings and other potential available spaces in cities – while respecting security constraints).
A more efficient policymaking on urban freight logistics requires cities to enhance their data collection capabilities, while private logistics or e-commerce (like food delivery) companies and services should be encouraged to share data. Potential applications are Urban Vehicle Access Regulations (UVARs), including Low Emission Zones (LEZ), smart parking and dynamic space management and better traffic planning. A vast amount of transport data from different parts of the transport system currently remains unexploited. Understanding barriers and opportunities as well as developing local capacity related to data collection within the urban and peri-urban transport system is a first step to encourage private and public organisations to share transport data. Potential benefits of the data applications need to be checked on how they could support the optimization of sustainable mobility plans (SUMPs) and sustainable logistics plans (SULPs).
A thorough evaluation should provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed measures in achieving local policy objectives should be evaluated and the possible barriers to their broad take up and deployment identified, together with recommendations on how to overcome them. This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the CIVITAS Initiative.
Proposals may include preparatory, take up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making. A demonstrated contribution to the implementation of the cities’ Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans is expected. If not already in place, the city can develop a Sustainable Urban Logistics Plan or other appropriate planning instrument to manage urban freight and logistics. Funding for major infrastructure works is not eligible. Proposals should plan for an active collaboration within the CIVITAS initiative.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Proposal results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
Robots with advanced physical functionalities, capabilities and efficiency (faster, safer, more agile and precise, etc.), to achieve wider variety of tasks efficiently. This includes beyond human capabilities (e.g. very large and very small scale capabilities or beyond human precision, or beyond human perception and decision making, for example by using multi-modal sensing).
Robots with greatly improved intrinsically safe and efficient human-centric human-robot and robot-environment/objects physical interaction capabilities, at natural human speed or more.
Robots with improved abilities and robustness, allowing them to adapt to changes in the environment, and making them more energy efficient in order to run autonomously for longer periods of time while maintaining trustworthiness and dependability.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to focus on technology and systems that significantly extend the physical capability of robots beyond the state of the art. Proposals should:
Improve the physical performance of robots (for example: improving robustness and resilience – to handle environment variations and unknown or unexpected situations - and energy efficiency to run safely and autonomously for longer periods of time, increased speed, some operating under extreme physical conditions such as under water, rough terrain, difficult climatic conditions, in the body, in the air, etc.).
Develop promising and innovative robotic concepts (e.g.: collaborative, modular and distributed, hyper redundant, highly reconfigurable, soft or miniaturised robotics) enabling adaptation to transformations of industry and society (including crisis), and in addition to examine design methods and tools for novel configurations and concepts.
Proposals should investigate novel scientific approaches or push the limit of existing ones to improve physical capabilities of robots relevant to industry and service needs in sectors where this is a barrier to uptake, such as innovative actuation principles (such as soft robotics, reconfigurable, hyper-redundant, modular robotics), or advance the field of miniaturised robotics, advanced control, improved hardware and increased trustworthiness and dependability (e.g. building on the latest results in mechatronics, advanced sensing and actuation, advanced materials, integrated and embedded systems for AI at the edge, neuromorphic computing).
Where relevant, proposals are also encouraged to embed, starting from the design stage, techniques, methods and tools that enhance the performance and interaction of robots in real world tasks where testability is limited and a “first time right” mentality must prevail; for example in space exploration, in dense urban environments, when developing applications for vulnerable people, or in safety critical infrastructures such as nuclear reactors, pressure vessels or chemical storage tanks.
Proposals are expected to rethink robot bodies, with improved physical and interaction capabilities (with the environment and with humans taking into account gender, age and disabilities as appropriate) to reach novel or advanced abilities, such as powerful, fast, precise, and intrinsically safe navigation, manipulation, sympathetic automated adaptation, etc. capabilities. The shape and size of robots can vary from miniature to large-scale, from soft, to more rigid structure, from manipulators, to ground, air, marine, in-vivo, exoskeletons and wearable robots, etc. Such proposals could also propose innovative approaches in building on and integrating the latest developments in key underlying technologies, or by exploiting multimodalities (audio, vision, AR/VR, haptics, etc.), improved safety mechanisms, physical collaboration, collaborative and swarm robotics. In addition, proposals can address energy efficiency, to address the current limitation of energy autonomy in robotics. Proposals could also focus on advances in cognitive mechatronics, where sensing and actuation are closely coupled with cognitive systems to deliver improved autonomy, dexterity, control, motion quality, interaction (including all modalities), adaptation and learning, and safer systems.
Proposals should also take into consideration trustworthy AI principles, as appropriate.
Progress should be demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring. Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project.
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[1], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[2], data platforms[3] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms.

Advancing AI, data and robotics, and automation for the optimisation of production and services value-chains, optimisation of products, services, processes, to increase competitiveness, improve working conditions, and environmental sustainability, and supporting the European Economy using AI, data and robotics technologies.
AI or learning systems (including, but not limited to self-learning, continuous and transfer learning, self-configuring systems) adapting production or services workflows to changing environments, dynamic and unpredictable resource constraints and to the capabilities and restrictions of humans and transferring results from one domain to another.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to integrate and optimise AI, data and robotics solutions in order to demonstrate, by addressing use-cases scenarios in actual or highly realistic operating environments, how they optimise production and service use cases.
Industry-empowering AI, data and robotics: enable and boost wide spread deployment of European technologies, in demonstrating clear benefits in particular applications coming from major industrial sectors, in improving processes, products or services, contributing to their competitiveness, quality of services, and strategy for environmental sustainability. Providing industry with more autonomous and more intuitive and easier to operate technologies they can trust and that are tailored for their needs, with the adapted and guaranteed levels of performance, reliability, safety, dependability, security and transparency. Providing trustworthy AI solutions combining various sources of data, sensors, interaction and information to address industrial challenges; combining the power of latest progress in AI, FAIR[1] data, autonomous or interactive robotics, smart devices and next generation networks and computing to increase automation and optimise processes, resources, and services, and addressing new technological challenges removing barriers for industrial deployment, and improving trust through more transparent and explainable AI. Where relevant latest development from low power consuming sensors, actuators and mechanisms, as well as new energy sources and batteries will be exploited to ensure energy autonomy for robotics. Promoting versatile, flexible, scalable, resilient physical and digital architecture that facilitate the future AI, data and robotics based services adoption.
Proposals should demonstrate how major European industries (covering all the sectors, from production[2] to services) can substantially benefit from optimising AI, data and/or robotics to maximise such benefits. Proposals are expecting to focus on specific use-cases to demonstrate such benefits, cross-sector use-cases are encouraged. Added value to the selected use-cases should be demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative industry and service relevant KPIs, demonstrators, benchmarking and progress monitoring.
While the proposals should be application driven, involving problem owners to define needs and validate the proposed solution, the focus is on optimising the enabling of AI, data and robotics technologies to maximise the benefit they bring.
Proposals should focus on demonstrating the added value of AI and/or Data and/or Robotics technologies to optimise value-chains, products, services or associated processes, including knowledge automation (including capturing and elicitation), to increase competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and where relevant, working conditions, for example, through added flexibility, configurability, adaptability, etc.
Digital twin approaches could be considered, where necessary and of added value.
Proposals should also address non-technical issues hampering the adoption of AI, data and robotics in the selected application domain, e.g. ethical aspects for the possible replacement of human operators, trust, human-robots collaboration and cooperation, security and safety.
Proposals will address the production or service sector, where substantial added value of AI, data and/or robotics can be demonstrated. This should be demonstrated with actual or highly realistic operating demonstrators at TRL6-7.
Proposals should clearly identify the sector it will focus on (either production or services).
Two types of proposals are expected:
Focused projects (EU contribution around EUR 3.00 milliom), involving the user industry and technology provider(s),
Larger projects (EU contribution around EUR 5.00 million), where a number of companies in a given application sector will identify in the proposal common challenges and use-cases, and organise competitive calls for AI, data and robotics solution providers to address such challenges. Competitive calls will be open to all types of companies, but only SMEs and Start-ups[3] will receive financial support to third parties, with a maximum of EUR 200 000 per third party[4] and 70% funding (100% for start-ups). At least 40% of the requested amount should be dedicated to financial support to third parties. The consortium will provide technical support with expertise in engineering integration, testing and validation to support the selected SMEs and start-ups acting as technology providers to demonstrate the added value of their solutions to address the challenges of the use-cases. Maximum one type of third party project will be funded per focused area (either production or services).
In all proposals user industries are expected to play a major role in the requirement and validation phases.
Besides financial support, these SMEs and start-ups successfully demonstrating the potential of their solutions, must receive support from business experts, provided by the action, to further develop their business and develop their market reach, and maximise their business opportunities.
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions, including public results developed in Member States and Associated Countries. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[5], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[6], data platforms[7] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms. Communicable results from projects should be delivered to the most relevant of these platforms so as to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.
Where appropriate, issues such as data access, data sovereignty and data protection should be addressed along the whole value chains, respecting all stakeholder interests, particularly SMEs.
The re-use and sharing of data collected and processed for AI and Data innovation should be encouraged to contribute to UN SDGs and the Green Deal (e.g.: sharing private data for the public good, B2G in addition to B2B; G2B data sharing may be identified, in view of helping businesses to increase sustainability and competitiveness).
Proposals should include dissemination activities to increase awareness about the potential value for society and people as well as the business of AI, data and robotics driven innovation.

Systems able to show high levels of reactivity and responsiveness and intelligibility when performing human-robot and robot-robot interactions in major application sectors.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to focus on application oriented use cases that enhance specific sectors in achieving significant improvements functional and economic performance.
Proposals will integrate novel robotics technologies into solutions that are capable of autonomously taking over dangerous, dull and dirty jobs, or that are capable of achieving tasks beyond human capabilities, in a range of innovative applications in key sectors or that are capable of reaching the level of reactivity, flexibility and adaptivity and natural intelligibility required for smooth and beneficial human-robot, as well as robot-robot collaboration and interaction.

Considering that human factors and socio-economic aspects can limit or lessen efficient use of robots, human-centred and socio-economic approaches in combination with multi-stakeholder co-design activities can contribute to sustainable development of new enabling technologies. Putting people at the forefront will ensure novel transformation pathways, which help utilise existing technology in novel ways, and propose feedback loop systems that engage human users in developing new sociotechnical learning situations and tools. Further, agile sociotechnical learning designs, can remedy e.g., less efficient technologies, by emphasizing human aspects of technologies in any application sector, from service to production, to domestic use. For this, an interdisciplinary approach involving both technical and SSH[1], in particular ethics, researchers is needed to improve interaction design and to provide expertise on trustworthiness and acceptability by workers, and address gender equality and intersectionality[3] where relevant.
The involvement of the user industry and the workers, possibly also the social partners, would be key to drive the proposals, not only to identify the needs and the application scenarios, but to be involved in the testing of the solutions and providing feedback to adapt the solutions to optimise the working conditions and performances. This is also essential for the acceptance of the technology. A human-centred approach will be key in all proposals, with deep involvement of the workers, professionals and other relevant stakeholders including experts in human-centred design, work safety, ergonomics, social partners or work organisation as appropriate. They will closely collaborate with the technology providers and integrators. The proposals should also take into consideration trustworthy AI principles including respect of human dignity and agency. Special attention will be given to including users of diverse age, gender and background.
Proposals are requested to dedicate at least 20% of their requested amount for FSTP to support SMEs or Start-ups in the development or enhancement of demonstrators, with a maximum of EUR 200 000 per third party[4], and 70% of the costs (100% for start-ups). The consortium will provide technical support with expertise in engineering integration, testing and validation to support the selected SMEs and start-ups acting as technology providers to demonstrate the added value of their solutions to address the challenges of the use-cases.
The selection of the application sectors should prioritise high impact sectors and use-cases where the technology can demonstrate maximum added value.
Each proposal will focus on one of the following use-cases:
Demonstrating substantial added value of robotics in major application sectors with high socio-economic and/or environmental potential impact, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of processes or services.
Demonstrating how robotics can improve human working conditions and satisfaction in taking over dangerous, dull, dirty or strenuous tasks, keeping workers away from unsafe and unhealthy jobs.
Proposals are encouraged, where appropriate, to develop configuration and deployment tools as well as tools for rapid configuration and re-configuration of robotics to improve deployability, reduce time to deployment, increase user driven (re)configuration, including through model-based approaches.
When possible, proposals should build on and reuse public results from relevant previous funded actions. Proposals should make use of connections to the Digital Innovation Hub networks, particularly those in Robotics, Data and AI. Full use should be made of the common resources available in the AI-on-Demand platform[5], Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics[6], data platforms[7] and, if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms. Communicable results from projects should be delivered to the most relevant of these platforms so as to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.
Proposals are expected to develop synergies with relevant activities in AI, Data and Robotics, primarily in destinations 1, 3, 4 and 6, but also in other destinations and clusters, and share or exploit results with relevant funded actions where appropriate.
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, Data and Robotics.
All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02. Where relevant, synergies with other PPPs are encouraged.

Truly mixed human-AI initiatives for human empowerment
Trustworthy hybrid decision-support systems
Scope:
Build the next level of perception, visualisation, interaction and collaboration between humans and AI systems working together as partners to achieve common goals, sharing mutual understanding and learning of each other’s abilities and respective roles.
Innovative and promising approaches are encouraged, including human-in the loop approaches for truly mixed human-AI initiatives combining the best of human and machine knowledge and capabilities, tacit knowledge extraction (to design the next generation AI-driven co-creation and collaboration tools embodied e.g. in industrial/working spaces environments).
Each proposal will focus on one of the two following research objectives, and clearly identify it:
Reach truly mixed human-AI initiatives for human empowerment. The approaches should combine the best of human and machine knowledge and capabilities including shared and sliding autonomy in interaction, addressing reactivity, and fluidity of interaction and making systems transparent, fair and intuitive to use, which will play a key role in acceptance. The systems should adapt to the user rather than the opposite, based on analysis, understanding and anticipation about human behaviour and expectations.
Trustworthy hybrid decision-support, including approaches for mixed and sliding decision-making, for context interpretation, for dealing with uncertainty, transparent anticipation, reliability, human-centric planning and decision-making, interdependencies, and augmented decision-making. Transparency, fairness, technical accuracy and robustness will be the key, together with validation strategies assessing also the quality of the decision of the AI supported socio-technical system.
All proposals should adopt a human-centred development of trustworthy AI and investigate and optimise ways of human-AI interaction, key for acceptance and democratisation of AI, to allow any user to take full advantage of the huge benefits such technology can offer, regardless of their age, race, gender or capabilities. This includes development of methods to improve transparency, in particular for human users, in terms of explainability, expected levels of performance which are guaranteed/verifiable and corresponding confidence levels, accountability and responsibility, as well as perceived trust and fairness. AI could also be used to empower humans in supporting them to improve responsible behaviours, where appropriate, but this should be done in full respect of the requirements ensuring trustworthy AI, including human autonomy.
Innovative scientific approach towards human-centric approaches will require multidisciplinary and trans-disciplinary approaches paying particular attention to intersectional factors (gender, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, disability) including SSH[1] and other disciplines relevant to stimulate novel research avenues, and eventually improve user-acceptance. Collaborative design and evaluation with users involvement should also be considered.
As a pilot activity, proposals in this topic will dedicate part of their activities on investigating novel ways of engagement by citizens or citizen representatives with AI development, with a view of optimising experience towards improving usability and experience for citizens (both at professional or daily life environment).
All proposals should contribute to build the next level of perception, visualisation, interaction and collaboration, and understanding between humans and AI systems working together as partners to achieve common goals, sharing mutual understanding of each other’s abilities and respective roles.
All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring, as well as illustrative application use-cases demonstrating concrete potential added value), and share results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform[2], a public community resource, to maximise re-use of results, either by developers, or for uptake, and optimise efficiency of funding.

Proposals results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Scientific progress in AI, addressing major challenges hampering its deployment.
Establishing a new pillars of the European AI lighthouse[1]
Reinforcing the leading unified European AI community
Scope:
To ensure European open strategic autonomy in critical technology such as AI, with huge potential socio-economic impact, it is essential to reinforce and build on Europe’s assets in such technologies, including its world-class researcher community, in order to stay at the forefront of technological developments.
As stated in the communication from the European Commission on Artificial Intelligence for Europe and the coordinated action plan between the European Commission and the Member States, while Europe has undeniable strengths with its many leading research centres, efforts are scattered. Therefore joining forces will be crucial to be competitive at international level. Europe has to scale up existing research capacities and reach a critical mass through tighter networks of European AI excellence centres. The proposals should develop mechanisms to reinforce and network excellence centres in AI, bringing the best scientists from academia and industry to join forces in addressing the major AI challenges hampering its deployment, and to reinforce excellence in AI throughout Europe via a tight network of collaboration.
Such networks are expected to mobilise researchers to collaborate on key AI topics and to increase the impact of the funding in progressing faster in joined efforts rather than working in isolation, with fragmented and duplicated efforts. Such networks, together with other mechanisms, will play an important role in reaching critical mass and in overcoming the present fragmentation of AI research in Europe.
Proposals will mobilise the best European teams in AI community to join forces to address major technical as well as sector- or societal-driven challenges: strengthening excellence, networking, multidisciplinarity, academia-industry synergies.
This initiative contributes to the initiative started in H2020 to develop a vibrant European network of AI excellence centres, and a vibrant AI scientific community, and continued in the first call of Horizon Europe. To complement and extend this initiative the proposals should create a network of excellence for the following topics:
Next Generation AI – covering foundational research and emerging and novel approaches, with a view of improving the technical performances of AI-based systems, such as increased accuracy, robustness, verifiability, dependability, adaptability, versatility, graceful degradation, etc. Research is also expected to address functional and performance guarantees.
Aspects to be covered include, but are not limited to: foundational research in artificial intelligence and machine learning including new paradigms, algorithms, architectures and novel optimization and regularization methods, hybrid AI, hybrid machine learning, data/sample –efficiency.
Scientific research and technologies prioritised in the latest SRIDA (Strategic Research, Innovation and Deployment Agenda of the AI, Data and Robotics PPP) , and complementing the previously selected Networks of Excellence centres (either in H2020-ICT48, or the first calls for Networks of Excellence Centres in Horizon Europe).
The selected proposals will maximise the coverage of the portfolio of networks of excellence centres in AI.
Composition of the Networks:
Proposals should be driven by leading researchers in AI and AI relevant technologies from major excellent AI research centres, and bringing the best scientists across Europe, including also from promising research labs. They will bring on board the necessary level of expertise and variety of disciplines and profiles to achieve their objectives, ensuring a multidisciplinarity and multi-sectorial research approach, while respecting equality and diversity among the attracted talents.
Activities of the Networks:
In order to structure the activities, the proposals will focus on important scientific or technological challenges with industrial and societal relevance where Europe will make a difference, by building on strengths, or strengthening knowledge to fill gaps critical for Europe.
Based on the identified challenges, the proposals will develop and implement common research agendas. The main vision and roadmap with targets within the projects, as well as methodology to implement and monitor progress will have to be specified in the proposal and can be further developed during the project.
Scientific progress will have to be demonstrated through testing on application specific datasets or use-cases. By extending the benchmarking of foundational research to application specific areas, the research community will simultaneously address advancements in AI and grand societal and technological challenges.
The proposals should define mechanisms to foster excellence throughout Europe, to increase efficiency of collaboration, including through networking and exchange programmes, and to develop a vibrant AI network in Europe.
Each network will disseminate the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the academic and industrial AI laboratories in Europe and involving them in collaborative projects/exchange programmes. (This could involve projects defined initially or via financial support to third parties, for maximum 20% of the requested EU contribution, with a maximum of 60k€ per third party[2]).
Each network will develop, where relevant, interactions with the industry, in view of triggering new scientific questions and fostering take-up of scientific advances
Each network will develop collaboration with the relevant Digital innovation Hubs and AI start-up initiatives, to disseminate knowledge and tools, and understand their needs.
These networks should also foster innovation and include mechanisms to exploit new ideas coming out of the network’s work (for instance via incubators).
Overall, each proposal will define mechanisms to become a virtual centre of excellence, offering access to knowledge and serve as a reference in their chosen specific field, including activities to ensure visibility.
The proposals should
include mechanisms to spread the latest and most advanced knowledge to all the AI-labs in Europe
develop synergies and cross-fertilization between industry, academia and civil society.
become a common resource and shared facility, as a virtual laboratory offering access to knowledge and expertise and attracting talents
provide broad access to AI excellence in Europe and also play an important role in increasing visibility
provide access to the required resources and infrastructure to support the R&D activities of the action, such as cloud and computing capacity, IoT, robotics equipment, support staff and engineers, where relevant, and the capacity to develop prototypes, pilots, demonstrators, etc.
include a number of major scientific and application challenges which will mobilise the community to join forces in addressing them. Continuous evaluation and demonstration of scientific and technological progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring processes) towards solving the targeted challenges will motivate the entire network and support publications and scientific career developments (providing reference benchmarks to publish comparative results, using the reference data, scenarios, etc.), and also showcase the technology in application contexts, to attract more user industries and eventually foster take up and adoption of the technology.
include mechanisms to share resources, knowledge, tools, modules, software, results, expertise, and make equipment/infrastructure available to scientists to optimise the scientific and technological progress. To that end, proposals should exploit tools such as the AI-on-demand platform[3] and further develop and expand the platform, to support the network and sharing of resource, results, tools among the scientific community, maximising re-use of results, and supporting faster progress. Mechanisms to test results and continuously measure and demonstrate progress should be integrated in the platform, which is also important to support the scientific community, allowing also for comparative analysis. Openness and interoperability of components are encouraged to develop synergies and cross-fertilization between different approaches and solutions (e.g. through modularity of components or open interfaces)
include collaboration mechanisms among the best AI and AI-relevant research teams, but also mechanisms to bring all European AI teams to the highest level of excellence. This is also in view of supporting and encouraging the adoption of AI technologies in all Member States and Associated Countries, with particular emphasis on geographical aspect and elimination of gaps between Member States/Associated Countries, as well as addressing existing gender disparities.
exploit and develop technology enablers, such as methodologies, tools and systems and exploit latest hardware development and data spaces, cloud and HPC resources.
These networks will also address a number of sector- or societally-driven challenges, mobilising the community towards achieving common goals in addressing such challenge that AI can help solving, demonstrating the potential positive impact on the society, economy and environment.
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project.
Proposals are expected to develop synergies:
With other Networks of excellence centres in AI funded in H2020 or Horizon Europe, with a view of, all together, create vibrant European network of AI excellence centres. To that end, the activities should integrate with and complement the activities of the H2020-ICT-48 projects. The proposals are expected to dedicate tasks to ensure this coherence.
With relevant activities in AI, Data and Robotics, primarily in destinations 3, 4 and 6, but also in other destinations and clusters (in particular with cluster 3 regarding security-related activities), and share or exploit results where appropriate.
All proposals are expected to allocate tasks to cohesion activities with the PPP on AI, Data and Robotics and funded actions related to this partnership, including the CSA HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01-02.
Background
The selected network(s) of excellence centres will contribute to the larger objective of the European Commission to establish the European AI lighthouse.
The AI lighthouse is expected to mobilise the AI community to collaborate on key AI research challenges and to progress faster in joined efforts rather than working in silos, leading to fragmented and duplicated efforts. This is essential to reach critical mass and overcome the present fragmentation of AI research in Europe.
The lighthouse will bring together stakeholders from research, innovation and deployment, to become a world reference in AI that can attract investments and the best talents in the field. The lighthouse will build on key pillars, each of them being a network of excellence centres specialising in a given topic where Europe has the potential to become a global champion.

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The target outcomes address disruptive research for complementary technologies enabling to support the full potential of future 6G wireless communications and service infrastructure, as presented in the SRIA. It covers:
The availability of fixed backhaul and longhaul networks with performance levels compatible with 6G KPI’s in terms of bandwidth, capacity, latency, and flexibility.
The availability of viable solutions, both from a technological and cost perspectives, allowing to bring beyond 5G and 6G services to places where terrestrial solutions are not economically viable, hence maximising coverage and access to services.
The availability of solutions addressing the need to develop 3D scalable networks capable to address flying devices, beyond current network solutions primarily designed for 2D usage.
Objective:
Please refer to the ""Specific Challenges and Objectives"" section for Stream B in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.
Scope:
The work covers technological progress in optical technologies, NTN technologies, IoT and short-range communication with specific focus on:
Flexible Capacity Scaling: The work addressed fundamental technologies on backhaul and long-haul networks able to reach rates of 10 Terabit/s optoelectronic Interfaces and multi-Petabit/s for optical fibre systems, operating at symbol rates of more than 100 GBauds, with viable transportation per bit cost especially for high demand multimedia services. It includes the flexible exploitation of new wavelength bands with progress in a wide range of technologies such as optical amplifiers, opto-electronics devices, and sub-systems. Techniques to safeguard optical network infrastructure against data leakage and unexpected service outages, improving system reliability are in scope.
Ultra-high Energy Efficiency: Develop novel switching optical architectures and new routing protocols, and design new semantic description and information models allowing the control of such optical networks, moving into essentially full-optical transport and control systems, considering new control mechanisms that optimise traffic flows across network layers, particularly if combined with optical space and wavelength switching, and bypass energy-hungry electronic functions.
Integration of Optical and Wireless Technologies from 2 different perspectives: i) technologies enabling the coexistence of fronthaul and backhaul networks and supporting end-to-end, wireless, and all-optical networks. This covers possible redesign of the backhaul/fronthaul application space such as packet switching with new packet friendly fronthaul interfaces in scenarios where many users generate a low amount of traffic data each, or multi-user mode (MU-MIMO) with an interoperable solution (Layer 2 and 3), reliability, durability, and energy efficiency; ii) in applicability of advanced light related technologies such as LEDs (light-emitting diodes), lasers, outdoor point-to-point devices (FSO — Free Space Optics), point-to-multipoint commercial applications (Li-Fi — Light Fidelity) or between devices (OCC – Optical Camera Communication) and Fiber Wireless Fiber (Fi-Wi), for the design of novel communication schemes, system architectures and protocols, in order to fully integrate these technologies in the communication infrastructure.
NTN infrastructures: A reference network architecture may be composed of a unified terrestrial and NTN multi-dimensional and multi-layered infrastructure, composed of space-borne and air-borne flying nodes possibly interconnected by means of wireless and optical links, to guarantee seamless and continuous connectivity. More importantly, the envisaged constellation would be structured hierarchically, i.e., flying nodes operating at different altitude and offering user centric coverage. Moreover, the flying nodes may also act as smart edge nodes by implementing storage and computation capabilities to pre-process and store large sets of information, eventually helping to reduce data rate requirements, increase energy efficiency, and guarantee end-to-end network connectivity. Based on the aforementioned network architecture, the focus of the activity will be the design of a novel concept for the seamless integration of NTN and terrestrial networks, with special emphasis on the design of a unified RAN, whose environmental sustainability should be properly addressed in all design implications. In this perspective, the main outcome of the activity will be three-fold. First, the activity should carry out the design of users’ antennas for the effective convergence of existing and future wireless networks with NTNs, hence relying also on low-cost flexible beam steering for NGSO satellite constellations and federated beamforming for satellites swarm. Second, a unified waveform will be developed by considering the peculiarities of both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (e.g., propagation impairments, doppler effects, delay). Third, horizontal/vertical handover procedures will be developed to allow for the seamless convergence between the envisioned networks, by building on novel cooperation schemes between the terrestrial and the envisioned flying nodes that may implement software defined payload for smarter and more energy-efficient coordination operations in space. The edge capability of flying nodes is also expected to be investigated to find out a trade-off between reduced data rate/increased energy efficiency and operational constraints (limited mass, power, storage) of flying nodes.
Integrated NTN service provision: Focus is on multi-layered NTN infrastructure service operations supporting service ubiquity, flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency, towards realisation of satellite-as-a-service. The work covers software-based non-terrestrial networks allowing full orchestration of the infrastructure resources such as power, bandwidth, time, space dimensions, node, coverage, and topology for a more flexible and dynamic system with overall better performance, efficiency, and sustainability. A software focus, disaggregation, and virtualization considering the ground and non-terrestrial segment, and their specific constrains are in scope. It should enable edge computing in space with computation and caching. Intelligent and autonomous resource management is sought, towards zero delay infrastructure reconfiguration, optimum orchestration of the infrastructure/service resources, dynamic spectrum management, beamforming and physical layer selection and optimization also by means of AI/ML strategies.
New IoT components and devices: The work targets the complex task of deployment and management of a large set of distributed devices with constrained capabilities, including components (micro-electronic components) and devices mainly for IoT and vertical sector applications as essential elements of future secure and trusted networks. The focus of the components and devices is on the requirements for the development of ultra-low power IoT (including self-powered and energy harvesting devices), extended to Tactile IoT components and on-IoT device AI techniques and methods. The research may also address IoT device management networking and service techniques that are adapted to the evolving distributed architectures for IoT systems based on an open device management ecosystem.
Troposphere Networking: The work addresses Tropospheric Networking as the new network serving all the “things” between the ground and ~15 Km altitude and focus on control and communication services for the drone, urban air mobility (future urban transportation systems that move people by air), balloon, aircraft, etc. Application scenarios covering both airplanes and UAVs should be defined and both data and control requirements identified. Solutions that rely on novel device to device (D2D), mesh, and cellular solutions for different types of mobility nodes may be considered, including approaches for unified RAN cellular (or cell free) coverage for both air and ground coverage, including high altitude dynamic beam steering, and efficient network level mobility management. This topic has a transformative potential for the infrastructure strand in general, and is considered particularly challenging if supported only by terrestrial technologies.
New Physical Layers and associated protocols: 6G networks are expected to operate over all types of communications, in multiple contexts. Research is sought on promising strategies to revolutionary new mechanisms for short range networks, technologies that expand the current limitations of cabled media, and technologies that provide low-power answers to interconnection of multiparty IoT resources.
Nano-Things Networking: The work addresses technologies to extend connectivity towards micro things, towards the realisation of nano-communications extending the reach of smart control to the level of small/tiny things, including molecules and cells. Materials with software-defined electromagnetic behaviour constitute applications t, paving the way for programmable wireless environments. The focus is on nanomaterials and nano-network architecture components (nodes, controllers, gateways) opening new prospects of usage of nano-scale things. At the PHY Layer, graphene antennas enable nano-communication within the 0.1 - 10 THz spectral window, which promises unprecedented communication data rates despite the nano-scale. At the MAC Layer, pivotal protocols could target Body Area Network (BAN) applications notably for health and self-monitoring and adapting industrial materials. This topic is considered of potential transformative impact across the communication ecosystem.
Projects may address one or more of the above topics."

Objective:
Please refer to the ""Specific Challenges and Objectives"" section for Stream B in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.
Scope:
The scope includes a set of complementary topics which will handle the securing of 6G technologies. Topics included are:
Human Centric methods that give the control to the user to guarantee privacy and confidentiality, for both service development and service execution. It addresses potential biased usage of AI and includes both the threats directly applicable to user data traffic, and their control and management. Methods for quantification of security to make the users aware of the systems and services used and associated risks is in scope as well as technologies for enhanced policy management (including huge data analytics, AI and cloud-native management and serverless approach) and facilitating human-understandable policies on trust and security of automated systems, to raise user awareness.
Holistic Smart Service frameworks which with secure lifecycle management and operation cover the development, provision, deployment, orchestration, and consumption of services for a new computing continuum that spans across multiple heterogeneous domains. Holistic Smart Service Frameworks include: a) IoT Device-Edge-Cloud continuum management and orchestration on virtualized and software-based elements, hardware accelerators, well as serverless frameworks, enabling zero-touch service automation; b) abstraction methods to support the network elements and providing flexible APIs, facilitating their combination addressing different orchestration styles at blurring RAN, MEC, Core and Cloud segments; c) new service developments to exploit of infrastructure slicing and sharing, capability exposure, discovery, and composition, for end-to-end management in the ICT continuum; d) end-to-end resource self-configuration and management based on key parameters such as service type, network traffic, channel conditions or mobility scenarios; e) composition methods able to handle situations where interconnected services are not known in advance, and able to model consequences (e.g., “digital twins”) with legal or ethical dimension, including new service-models that enhance human-centricity and interaction capabilities.
Secure Lifecycle management targets the provision of a smart, secure, adaptive, and efficient service management, spanning the lifecycle of smart networks and services (including vertical support), to manage risks and costs. It covers improved predictive orchestration algorithms for optimal usage of resources (processing, storage, networking) in terms of trust and risk level whilst bringing down OPEX and energy consumption for flexible provisioning of service instances and supports recursive deployments of functional components for secure multi-tenancy. It addresses AI-based service co-design to evolve DevSecOps methods that meet ethical, legal, social, economic, and energy-efficiency requirements together with tools for ‘security by design’ and for creation of “safer” services, to manage risks from dynamically evolving requirements and threats. Drastic incident reduction and response time for massive supervision of infrastructure elements is in scope as well as mechanisms for infrastructure and service certification for security and performance. The work also covers secured programmability with mechanisms to verify data authenticity and truthfulness (e.g., smart contracts, fact checking services), along with trusted digital interactions, especially in dynamically- composed service environments, including software engineering methodologies and tools and cost-effective certification in dynamically changing systems
Efficient security enablers build capability for untrusted environments. Security techniques using Artificial Intelligence, rule-based, statistical, contextual analysis and potentially relying in Distributed Ledger Technologies to improve trust in networking elements and service functions are in scope, as well as techniques to guarantee the trustworthiness and security of systems based on disaggregated cloud environments and able to reliably handle seamlessly any hardware of software element from different suppliers. Enablers can build upon developing technologies such as Full Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Multi Party Computation (MPC), Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), Anonymisation/pseudonymization, data integrity of AI-based process constitute a set of relevant topics. Enablers should help to anticipate known potential threats which will mature based on other technological advances within the timeframe of the development and potential first deployments of 6G. Such threats though not yet active, are well known and are anticipated by the ICT community (e.g. Shor’s algorithm). New cryptographic techniques, and techniques to manage and distribute keys, are in development and maturing. Such techniques may be applied to end-to-end smart network security, reaching beyond performance and protection capabilities of traditional symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic and associated key exchange techniques.
Projects may address one or more of these topics."

Objective:
Please refer to the ""Specific Challenges and Objectives"" section for Stream C in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.
Scope:
The target beyond 5G/6G experimental infrastructures provides the capability to demonstrate and validate the most ambitious use case scenarios as deriving from the European 6G vision. This includes the capability to interconnect the physical world, the digital world and the human world based on a connectivity and service platform with performance capabilities beyond current 5G platforms and IoT application scenarios. The target experimental platform hence includes validation capabilities at every relevant layer of the IoT-connectivity-service provision value chain, covering at least innovative components and microelectronic capabilities, fixed/multi radio access (including NTN), backhaul, core network, and service technologies and architectures, covering disaggregated scenarios like Open RAN, Core, or blurred RAN/core scenarios. It includes end-to-end virtualisation and network slicing as key components to support multi-tenant environments, integration of private/non-public and public networks and multiple vertical use cases. It also includes the device and IoT integration and the cloud edge capabilities with scale up capabilities for demanding services-based on a clear EU strategy for an edge integration into a complete cloud continuum. The experimental platforms will offer the capability to support disaggregated architectures enabling software and hardware implementations that goes beyond the 5G architecture and that will eventually be able to support 6G services. It is also futureproof by enabling to incorporate novel or disruptive technological approaches, and notably new spectrum and associated technologies, “AI-based service architectures”, communication and computing integration, AI-based zero-touch management and intelligence connectivity, integration of communication and sensing capabilities as typical, though not limitative capabilities. The experimental platform is also capable for supporting and demonstrating key non-functional properties and in particular end-to-end security, security provision in the context of further integration into a larger environment (hyperscalers), energy efficiency at both platform and use case levels, and EMF-awareness.
The demonstration capabilities of the target platform are to be assessed against a set of well-defined KVI’s and KPI’s. As 6G is still largely undefined, proposals may target in the first place KPI’s currently contemplated under authoritative industrial/research environments (e.g., 5G PPP ICT-52-2020 projects, and national 6G initiatives or of other regions of the world). However, the proposals should be flexible enough to accommodate new relevant KPI’s as they become available from the wider 6G community and from potential use cases.
Beyond technological validation of critical components, technologies and architectures, the experimental platform provides the required openness to host vertical use cases pilots. It is desirable that the platforms support open framework principles (e.g., both legal and technical like open APIs) enabling future vertical projects to access and use them. It is also strongly desirable that these facilities are built in a way that allows the evaluation of competing technologies where appropriate.
Such experimental infrastructure may be based on the integration of components in several solutions developed in the context of previous initiatives like the 5G PPP, IoT or cloud computing projects or in the context of ongoing European 6G initiatives, also at the national level, but this is not a pre-requisite.
Each Project may include multiple components in different locations/countries, targeting interconnections between them to create a pan-European experimentation Platform. It is important to note that the stakeholders will facilitate easy replication of results in the same or additional locations/countries if this platform will be selected for large scale trials as part of subsequent phase of Stream D.
The target experimental facilities and their modules should be open and accessible for a long enough period to allow for an easy handover from one phase to the other. Conditions should allow experimental facilities to be easily reused under fair and reasonable conditions for subsequent phases of the SNS programme implementation.
In view of ensuring maximum take up of the validated technologies, proposals should include a significant representation of European industrial players with strong demonstrated impact at standardisation level."

Objective:
The prime objective of the coordination and support work is to facilitate the activities of the European SNS Initiative, as outlined in the SNS contractual partnership, expanding first phase activities, and preparing for subsequent phases.
In addition to this, the CSA project has a second prime objective to capture and promote the European view on 6G, the achievements of the 6G SNS and monitor the development and impact of these results on the evolution of 6G in Europe over the period of life of the 6G SNS initiative. This work will also look to the future and consider what additional actions are necessary to maintain the European momentum and leadership in 6G and facilitate the uptake of 6G by the European vertical sectors.
During the planned 6G SNS initiative period a lot of the 6G developments, global 6G regulations and integration of 6G into sectorial business models and processes, need to be studied and stimulated to enable the full potential of 6G networks, services, and devices in Europe. A key activity will be to support international collaboration SNS CSA in promoting the 6G SNS initiative views across the wider community of 6G SNS stakeholders, from national authorities, European member states initiatives, peer initiatives (ESA, Eureka, etc.), European standards communities and the Global 6G discussion to ensure European leadership in the area. A very tight cooperation with the JU public and private members is expected

This project should provide a global end-to-end system framework building up on the 5G PPP results that are targeting 6G networks, provide new solutions for well selected topics and identify the place and role of each topic from the above-mentioned 4 strands. Results generated in other frameworks (e.g., national or international 6G initiatives) may also be considered as appropriate. The project should equally investigate both societal and technical aspects to cover citizen needs in 2030 and beyond.
It shall provide at least the following results:
A complete system perspective of future 6G SNS platform, from an architectural and functional perspective and from an end-to-end, user-to-user (human and automated) perspective, integrating key results of other strands of Stream B as they become available.
The consolidation of 6G KPI’s and KVI’s as federating SNS targets for European R&I in the field.
The identification of key 6G use cases, their requirements, and how they can be supported by the 6G retained architecture/technologies.
The identification of the most promising technologies, being evaluated under a complete system design approach, towards the realisation of the 6G vision.
The translation of societal/ethical use case needs, targets and objectives into technological requirements and the identification of the technologies that can match these requirements.
The identification of critical technologies for future standardisation work.
The project should, with equal importance and prominence, investigate societal needs, including KVIs and their related KPIs, as well as technologies in areas indicated in the above Stream B strands, that are promising to fulfil these requirements and needs. It is expected that the societal KVI outputs of the project can be used as a prominent platform to establish a dialogue with the civil society whilst the outputs on technologies and architectures support European voice in global technological fora.
Also, this project should provide well-defined means of communication with the 6G-IA[1] (i.e., 6G-IA Working Groups) for ensuring that the vision and directions of the European ICT community are appropriately captured. An advisory board of experts and representatives from key public and private stakeholders and organizations may be considered. In that context, the project should be open to incorporate, where relevant, results and approaches originating from key stakeholders beyond the project partners.
Objective:
Please refer to the ""Specific Challenges and Objectives"" section for Stream B in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.
Scope:
6G networks should take into consideration societal requirements as well as technological improvements. For that purpose, the project should equally address both aspects with the ambition to cover the duality of the European approach: “Sustainable 6G” and “6G for sustainability”. The overall goal is to Identify the technology needed to provide value to the society, being environmentally and economically sustainable.
The project should equally address both of the following aspects:
The consolidation of 6G societal and technical requirements, KVI’s and KPI’s, to serve 6G use cases and the associated architectural and technological avenues to realise them. It consolidates results of other technological strands and provides comparative assessments of the various solutions, pushing the limits if technology and building a generic 6G toolbox with trade-offs across topics that will be investigated by more than one project (e.g., minimization of the energy consumption, coordination of AI/ML solutions in deployed in different network domains).
The Societal focus and technologies to address societal goals is an important aspect. A widely validated approach should be developed to transform key SDG requirements into technological solutions and performance objectives.
The work also identifies key technologies to convey towards standardization with common approaches with users, towards the realization of a consensus framework including verticals from the onset. It is expected to be supported by the key 6G players of Europe across the value chain, including development of components and the needs of vertical industries, spanning industry to academia. This provides the view of a European technological solution for the consolidation of a 6G vision, objectives and technological developments leading to strong European position at standardization level, and paving the way towards future deployment.
The project is planned to start concurrently with other Stream B RIAs as several activities are needed before integrating the results and key findings of SNS Phase 1 Stream B projects. These activities indicatively include the definition of an appropriate set of 6G use cases, KVIs and KPIs incorporating the analysis of key findings from pre-6G technologies (5G PPP and other topic related initiatives). This should include the setup and work on key topics that the stakeholders of the project will identify as important for 6G networks and that may not even be included in other Stream B Strands, etc.

A close working relationship with the SNS coordination and support CSA
A strong cooperation with the operational process of the private Member of the JU, notably in support of R&I, events and stakeholder management at large having an international dimension
Objective:
The International Cooperation and Global Events CSA has the prime objective to present leverage and position the activities and achievements of the European SNS Initiative, as outlined in the SNS contractual partnership, in the major European forums and in the global context.
This work will also maintain dialogues on key strategic issues with the peer communities globally to facilitate consensus building on issues such as spectrum allocation, global 6G regulations, etc., with a view to ensuring recognition of the value and quality of the European 6G solutions.
A strategic aspect of the external relationships is to cooperate with projects outside of the 6G SNS Initiative, on the use and uptake of the 6G SNS network architecture(s) and interfaces. This involves supporting many relationships to national programmes, EUREKA Clusters (in particular the Celtic-Plus Cluster), Peer Partnerships (e.g., HPC, KDT, AI, Data and Robotics, Photonics Europe, CCAM, etc.) and Associations (e.g., 5GAA, 5GACIA, etc.) and other objectives in the HEU as possible.
International liaison and discussions are a critical part of positioning the European 6G SNS initiative on the global stage. It is essential that the 6G SNS JU results are available, and the achievements can be peer reviewed by other regions and initiatives to ensure that they are respected and used for consensus building as a precursor to international standardisation.
A further dimension of the 6G SNS liaison work will be the promotion and representation of the 6G SNS work in global fora. This will involve seeding project presentations at international fora and, in selected cases, orchestrating demonstrations at intercontinental meetings. The 6G SNS will be expected, in turn, to host some of these international meetings.
In all cases the 6G SNS results should be accessible and available to be promoted. Moreover, the CSA should strive to see that they can adopted in an uncomplicated way.

Objective:
Please refer to the ""Specific Challenges and Objectives"" section for Stream D in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.
Scope:
The target beyond 5G / 6G validation work through large scale trials is expected to cover at least the following domains:
- Application level: two cases may be considered: i) applications already possible with 5G like AR/VR. Validation should demonstrate clear benefits of the considered technologies and architectures in terms of scalability, security, and performance improvements in line with medium to long-term socio-economic scenarios. ii) applications that are not considered within the 5G current developments, such as applications to eventually create a 6G network with a sixth sense that intuitively understands human intentions, making human interactions with the physical world more intelligent, effective, and anticipating our needs (towards Internet of Sense). In that case, the validation should primarily address technological feasibility and affordable deployment.
- Management level: the validation should demonstrate the efficiency of the end-to-end resource management technologies and architectures, through two aspects: i) significant improvement of (new) resource usage efficiency, towards zero-touch management and effective OPEX; ii) additional capabilities offered to vertical users through open interfaces enabling more efficient implementation of use cases (e.g., AI for networks vs. network for AI at the application level).
- Societal level: the validation should demonstrate significant improvement of key parameters like energy consumption (both for the SNS platform and the vertical use case), safety (inc. EMF exposure), coverage and access, cost and affordability, trustworthiness, security and privacy being part of the priority SDGs to demonstrate in “user context”.
The Large-Scale Pilots should be carried out from an end-to-end perspective, with representative technologies covering the full value chain, including devices, connectivity, and service delivery. They should demonstrate the integration of different IoT/cloud/edge/computing environments (public and/or private) towards a distributed environment with a landscape unified management able to support the emergence of a European offer and capability in that domain.
It is expected that beyond the vertical sectors already quite advanced on 5G and structured around 5G Associations (e.g., automotive with 5G-AA and industry 4.0 with 5G-ACIA), other less advanced sectors will join the initiative. This applies notably to sectors highly related to public policies like healthcare, energy, and public safety, also more relevant in a post covid-Green Deal context.
Projects will involve and call for SMEs, scaleups and startups. SMEs, scaleups and startups are expected to play a key role in this process with new market-driven applications that can build value on the 5G infrastructure. This support will be a critical enabler of European-led innovation, fast track adoption, and stimulate private sector investment, across verticals.
The performance capabilities are to be assessed against a set of well-defined KVI’s and KPI’s. As 6G is still largely undefined, proposals may target in the first place KPI’s currently contemplated under authoritative industrial/research environments (e.g., 5G PPP ICT-52-2020 projects, national 6G initiatives or of other regions of the world). However, the proposals should be flexible enough to accommodate the view of KVI’s and new relevant KPI’s as they become available from the wider 6G community and from potential use cases. Also, performance improvement in all domains requires definition of a benchmark against which improvements may be evaluated. Cross project collaboration is needed to define such a benchmark that will be part of the target outcome KPI repository of the SNS Partnerhsip. Also, it is expected that software entities implement the target services in Open-Source Code and with open interfaces for further reutilisation in subsequent phases.
SNS LST&Ps are expected to attract the participation of vertical industries in view of stimulating a strong European participation in future downstream standardisation phases. Therefore, participation of industrial actors with demonstrated strong standardisation impact is desired.
In this early phase, the projects may leverage the existing platforms, or components from them, from 5G Infrastructure PPP Phase 3 End-to-End Facility projects or/and Vertical Pilots projects and/or relevant national or international (ESA) initiatives). The projects may also leverage as relevant/appropriate existing IoT/Cloud/Edge platforms or components that may be integrated together. A smooth transition is envisioned from 5G Infrastructure PPP activities to capitalize on existing results."

","26 April 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
The expected outcomes support the vision of a massively digitised economy and society calling for intelligent connectivity and service provision across a huge number of heterogeneous domains, resources, and with an unlimited number of application requirements. These cover the availability of:
An overall system functional architecture to cater for the expected extreme 6G use cases.
An architecture able to break the boundaries between different infrastructure, service, business, and application environments, capable for a unified service provision across heterogeneous communication and computing environments.
Solutions for inter-computing beyond the inter-networking capabilities of the Internet, making possible the execution of services across multiple heterogeneous but seamlessly inter-working domains, each possibly applying different policies (e.g., in terms of security, routing, access to resources, etc.), routing mechanisms, access mode to application services, etc.
An internet-like architecture supporting much higher dynamics and versatility for its topology and service instantiation while significantly lowering energy consumption.
Architecture and technologies enabling the connectivity and service infrastructure to be programmable with a single, unifying, and open controllability framework, spanning all resources a tenant is authorized to control, including resources from currently separate and heterogeneous domains, such as enterprise and telecom networks, virtual and physical, data centres and routers, satellites, and terrestrial nodes.
Objective:
Please refer to the ""Specific Challenges and Objectives"" section for Stream B in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.
Scope:
The scope covers the realisation of a unified and open communication and computing architecture beyond the current SBA capabilities. Such architecture will enable seamless operations and service execution across a multiplicity of heterogeneous domains, infrastructures, services, business, and application heterogeneous domains, whilst providing secure and reliable scalability towards an unlimited number of application requirements. Hence paving the way towards massive digitisation. It offers a consistent/reliable programmable environment enabling “tailor made” implementation of various tenants’ requirements. Focus is on complementary issues as follows:
Technologies for scaling Inter-computing systems: The work addresses technologies and system architectures able to efficiently span all resources, regardless of their type (compute, storage, networking), nature (virtual/physical) or location (remote/local/cross domains), dynamically adding and removing resources as they come and go. System control solution aspects effectively handling authentication, naming, addressing, routing and related functions for massive number of elements may also be examined. Resource control takes an end-to-end approach covering the device/IoT domains with service deployment at the deepest possible “edge” in the user vicinity. The work enables a fusion of data communication with distributed computing, transforming the best effort Internet into a sustainable, greener inter-computing system. The needs of service developers and end-users may be considered, such as time-to-market, continuous functional improvements, increasing volumes of data collection for AI, the overall energy cost of providing added intelligence, as well as software foundations and interfaces, with a design-to-cost and design-to-energy efficiency framework.
Control and controllability separation: Infrastructure programmability is creating a new level of decoupling between the platform delivering the service and the service elements. Network virtualization brings additional degrees of freedom in flow processing and combines edge and network in one logical entity. It addresses optimal system programmability deployment on top of a shared, distributed multi-stakeholder infrastructure (at a horizontal and vertical levels). This is composed of different resources, shared by instantiation from other executed services or slices, while establishing system integrity and self-preservation in runtime for a distributed, dynamic resource environment. The architecture should be able to manage elements of different configurations and implementations, different active modules, deployed on top of more generically capable resource pool, in a multistakeholder environment. Data quality and trust levels are key parameters to consider as well as potential disruptions in network/service operation and how the overall architecture should respond to these to meet an appropriate resilience level for the service providers and the end users. Concretely, the aspect to be explored here is the separation[1] of service- and tenant-specific control in terms of the generic, autonomic, unified infrastructure and resource controllability featuring high resilience facing resource dynamics, and providing equivalents of so-called “protected modes” known from other execution environments.
Frictionless inter-domain resource management: The work addresses frictionless and optimised resource management and orchestration across multi-stakeholder cloud, edge, and fog platforms to meet specific application requirements (e.g., latency, performance and other relevant 6G KPI’s), with efficient utilisation of resources for both service provider and verticals operating under specific constrains (e.g., resilience, timing, cost, energy, CO2, etc). It includes capability to swap computation loads as a function of efficiency and local energy availability under strict resilience and timing requirements. To address resource control, including resource pooling, service request scheduling and conflict resolution, AI is expected to play a relevant role (e.g., network orchestration).
Native integration of AI for telecommunications. The massive adoption of AI tools will exacerbate the problem of energy consumption of the ICT infrastructure. Native integration of AI/ML is in scope to implement adaptive decision making at different time scales with expected impact on energy and performance efficiency gains for such distributed multi-stakeholders’ systems. The adoption of these tools may trigger changes in the existing architectures. Therefore, it will be crucial to devise energy efficient architectures and computation algorithms to have energetically sustainable communication and computing paradigms for future mobile networks that adequately explore artificial intelligence technologies. Research needs to be done on: i) distributed edge AI solutions, covering consensus convergence, resource limitations, localized data management, transfer learning; ii) adequate development of training data for telecommunications; iii) AI security and comprehensibility of ML for the applications identified above; iv) strongly distributed AI/ML instrumentation integrated at the architecture layer.
New Data Transfer Paradigms with deep Edge integration: The work considers systems where edge, access and cloud are increasingly undistinguishable (i.e., used homogeneously by the service layer). This work addresses edge-specific requirements originating for example from IoT devices that are service dedicated, intelligent and are yet resource constraint (e.g., micro-electronics for battery driven components). This yields a richness of resources that are challenging when being integrated into a common resource worldview. To support this, novel suitable switching, resource management and scheduling mechanisms that take all constraints into account, whilst relying on edge-specific control agents enabling the enforcement of the policies underlying the switching decisions and scheduling solutions. This further includes new IoT device management techniques that are adapted to the evolving distributed architectures for IoT systems based on an open device management ecosystem. The complexity originating from the diversity of different types of physical devices and communication links is also considered (sensors, user terminals, edge and data centre computers, optical and electrical switches, fibre, and satellite links) together with the diversity of service requirements. Highly scalable resource management techniques with deep compute/communication integration across multiple domain components are needed.
Improve data plane performance: The work addresses innovative protocols in view of overcoming known Internet limitations as originating from new scenarios and vertical requirements (ultra-low latency, extreme mobility, ultra-high data rates, integration of end-terminals, controlled security, space applications), It addresses functional improvements of the basic transport mechanisms with guaranteed packet delivery, increased dynamics in network topologies as well as compute resources and the resulting required flexibility in routing, while also considering security and precision delivery. These protocols should be able to flexibly operate in local/global architectures and provide primitives to perform the integration of new localized environments in an intelligent ICT infrastructure (either as overlay or underlay protocols). Brown or green slate approaches may be considered, as well as challenges from hardware architectures, protocol design, semantic approaches, optimized software focused data planes, as well as a clear migration strategy from legacy technologies.
Deterministic Networking: The work opens an entirely new class of innovative application by enabling deterministic networking, beyond today’s best efforts Internet characteristics. It goes well beyond the current work of 3GPP Release 16 targeting industrial applications. It addresses major challenges notably performance requirements: < 75 µs latency (including fibre transmission which adds 5 µs/km), < 8 ns timing error, and several tens of Gbps throughput for critical signals, values which are outside of the current work. It extends deterministic networking across multiple stakeholders and domains, and the associated strict reliability requirements associated with such networking in dynamic environments should be covered. Key properties of the wireless communication link are considered as an integral component for the overall deterministic network design.
Proposals may address one or more of the topics above.

Objective:
Please refer to the ""Specific Challenges and Objectives"" section for Stream B in the Work Programme, available under ‘Topic Conditions and Documents - Additional Documents’.
Scope:
This work addresses the fundamental technologies required for developing the radio components of next generation 6G wireless communications for public or private networks, systems, its coexistence with existing technologies, as well as promoting easier deployment and migration from older RAN technologies. Focus is on:
Terahertz Communications and Ultra-Massive MIMO: Development of technologies and systems enabling Terabit-per-second (Tbps) wireless communications needed to support long term exponential capacity increase of mobile communication networks. Piggybacking on H2020 results in THz communication, the work further explores technologies above 100GHz with focus on channel measurements, modelling, and sounding strategies, as well physical layer, and signal processing techniques and, notably, waveform design. Due to the shorter wavelength, many antennas can be packed in a small area thus, leading to the concepts of mMIMO and ultra mMIMO which require further investigation. Meta-surfaces to control propagation are in scope as well as work in the computing domain to deal with the massive amount of processing needs of Terahertz communications. Technologies to change propagation characteristics of wireless channels, e.g., through intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) or large intelligent surfaces (LIS) are also in scope to enable the replacement of the current cell-/ network-centric approach by a user-centric one where the cluster serving a particular UE can be determined dynamically with realisation of a cell-free mMIMO and uniform services across the network can be offered.
Joint communication and sensing: Communication work is complemented by work in the field of location and sensing capabilities for devices. It includes joint radar and communications, with signal processing techniques for wideband beamforming, or spatial multiplexing, as well as transceivers for higher spectral efficiencies, better power efficiency, faster data converters, high density digital logic, chip-package-antenna co-design, and combination of silicon technologies with III-V technologies. Waveform design can extend to the radar domain to offer the potential for combined radar and communications capabilities. Experimental prototypes are in scope.
New Waveforms, Random and Multiple Access: Support scalability of future Machine Type Communication with massive number of connected devices transmitting very sporadic data, with minimum protocol overhead and energy consumption. While strategies relying in the CP-OFDM (cyclic-prefix OFDM) waveforms have been adopted in 4G and 5G, other waveforms (e.g., FBMC, GFDM) allow to relax the strict synchronization and orthogonality conditions of OFDM and, by doing so, increase the spectral containment of 6G systems. Besides other promising multiple-access schemes may also be considered such as Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) or Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) to enable grant-free access, or other novel promising directions with potential for adoption at standardisation level (considering not only dense cell but also sparse cell coverage).
Enhanced Modulation and Coding: Support to innovative channel coding approaches towards “error free” channel transmission. It should solve current bottlenecks in implementation issues such as computational complexity, algorithm parallelisation, chip area, energy efficiency, etc. whilst supporting hundreds of Gigabits per second and low latency. It is compatible with Increasingly massive MIMO-implementations and contribute to the future modulation and coding schemes, possibly mixing data-driven and model-driven approaches, as required for 6G, retaining reliable, energy-efficient characteristics.
Wireless Edge Caching: Support the capability to deliver Terabytes per month for all in a scalable and cost-effective manner. Focus is on the information theoretic foundations, in the coding and signal processing algorithms, and in the wireless network architecture design, to exploit the potential gain of content-awareness. It covers technologies exploiting edge caching in areas as Coding (e.g., combining edge caching with modern multiuser MIMO physical layer schemes), Protocol architectures (e.g., combining edge caching with video quality adaptation); and AI/ML based content popularity estimation and prediction, to efficiently update the cached content. Potential vertical-specific developments may be considered as well.
Human-friendly Radio systems: Support innovative antenna and physical layer technology for higher acceptability of radio infrastructures by citizens. It covers new antennas and new antenna systems, that need to visually blend seamlessly in the urban landscape through use of new designs or new materials, in the context of an increased density of base stations and more complex antennas to support higher frequency ranges. It also covers antenna systems for EMF control and awareness to minimise human exposure. The target antenna work should account for mMIMO and address the limitation of linear increase of the number of antennas to overcome the much higher path loss in THz-band.
Spectrum Re-farming and Reutilisation: Support future high bandwidth demand and versatile spectrum usage requirements by multiplicity of applications through optimised spectrum management, sharing and dynamic application aware allocation. It covers spectrum reutilisation between RAT’s, including NTN access, and addresses new THz spectrum. Novel approaches with use of AI/ML technology for real-time spectrum efficiency is in scope. It also covers specific sharing scenarios for unlicensed spectrum use, and fundamental work on these challenges for new terahertz bands will also be needed.
Proposals may address one or more of the topics above."

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Contribute to the objectives of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission by accelerating the transition towards climate neutrality in cities through the promotion of zero-emission, shared, active and human-centred mobility;
Increase the extent and speed of the take-up and upscaling of innovative, best practice and replicable safe, affordable and sustainable urban mobility solutions in the living labs involved in the proposals[1] (at least four cities/project and four follower cities, considering geographic diversity including in terms of regions’ level of development) while facilitating the common lesson drawing and learning at European level, in order to contribute to the priority of the Zero Pollution Action Plan's objectives, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the EU road safety policy framework 2021-2030 for a 50% reduction target for deaths and also for serious injuries by 2030;
Solutions for at least ten unsafe areas/living labs in urban/peri-urban areas using innovative planning, design and implementation approaches, including but not limited to co-creation and/or citizen engagement, modelling and AI, digital and smart enforcement tools, dynamic space reallocation, with a view to reduce road safety risks, reducing exposure to air and noise pollution and the perceived feeling of unsafety for pedestrians and cyclists;
Re-assess road and public space quality responding to needs of diverse groups (examples include but are not limited to: women, children, people with disabilities and older people); actions may include but are not limited to improving data collection for foot, bike and e-scooter traffic as well as the mechanisms for reporting pedestrian and cyclists, e-scooter injuries and deaths;
Address proactively potential risk raised by expected increases in cycling and e-scooters;
Rebalancing the attribution of public space to different modes of transport so that it better reflects the actual or desired local modal split as well as support reaching Vision Zero[2] and zero-emission objectives, thus increasing road safety and quality of life in cities;
Public space redesign actions targeted by the awarded projects should consider the circular economy principles, adaptation to climate change (in particular heatwaves), cross-sectoral synergies and not come at the cost of removing or deterioration of parks, trees or green recreational areas.
Scope:
The European Union is facing a multitude of interconnected demographic, public health and environmental challenges: the climate is changing, road deaths are stagnating, urbanization is increasing, air quality standards are still breached in over 100 cities, obesity is rising and the population is ageing.
But there is an increasing recognition at local, national and EU level that boosting the levels of active mobility, particularly walking and cycling, can play an important role in overcoming many of these challenges. Such a policy will also have economic benefits. Based on conservative estimates, even current levels of cycling in the EU produce benefits valued at around 150 billion euros per year[3].
During the Covid-19 pandemic, larger cities in Europe announced infrastructure changes to promote cycling and walking. For instance, they temporarily widened or created new cycle lanes to allow safe overtaking with physical distancing limits in mind while also implementing more 30km/h limits or 20km/h zones. The scope of this action is to support local authorities in accelerating mobility changes and address a significant concern, namely that people returning to work after the lockdown will seek out alternatives so that allocating public space, bicycles, pedestrians and public transport and reducing the space available for cars will encourage people to cycle, walk or use public transport rather than take the car.
Taking into account where possible the Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators[4], projects should collect data on differences between patterns, behaviours and habits in relation to the mobility of various categories of vulnerable road users. Such data should where possible, be integrated with cross-domain data, to ensure interdependencies and co-benefits are identified. Projects should identify specific mobility needs and public space re-design needs, taking into account actual and perceived safety and security of women, children and accessibility for people with disabilities e.g. blind people in shared spaces, people in prams, wheelchairs and other supporting vehicles. Measures should be taken to implement necessary changes within the timeline of the project.
In addition, projects should also provide clear guidance to cities and Member States and Associated Countries on how to systematically incorporate the vulnerable road users dimension into infrastructure planning, including aspects of safety and security, accessibility, digital and smart tools for enforcing speed limits and vehicle access, design and operation or services and public spaces, including mobility hubs, public transport and shared mobility.
The projects associated to this call topic should envisage cooperation with the SUMP coordination platform, ELTIS[5] and produce thematic a comprehensive topic guides stemming from the projects and accompanying the SUMP guidelines.
Projects should also take stock of lessons learnt during the period of imposition and lifting of Covid-related restrictions and propose suitable solutions for the future when it comes to resilience, safety and accessibility of public infrastructure.
A thorough evaluation, with a clear baseline in each city, should provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed measures in achieving local policy objectives on safety, security and accessibility as well as on climate and pollution should be evaluated and the possible barriers to their broad take up and deployment identified, together with recommendations on how to overcome them. This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the CIVITAS Initiative.
Proposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative through the signature of collaboration agreement. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan of the proposal. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined during the grant agreement phase. Collaboration with the Mission Platform (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) is essential and should take place through the CIVITAS initiative. The latter should establish, through a Memorandum of Understanding, clear links with the Mission portfolio for synergies and complementarities.
Proposals may include preparatory, take up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making. At the same time, projects would be expected to share their results and good practice with the upcoming European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Urban Agenda for the EU and relevant smart specialisation partnerships e.g. the Safe and Sustainable Mobility Partnership or EIT Urban Mobility with its objectives to deploying user‐centric, integrated eco‐efficient and safe mobility solutions in urban areas.

Projects results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Improved flows of innovation resources between innovation ecosystems at various levels of developments;
Improved quality of entrepreneurial education and local talents equipped with skills to support business acceleration and digitalisation[1];
Enhanced entrepreneurial activity in developing innovation ecosystems and its scale up across Europe or internationally;
Increased youth (self) employability;
Raised awareness of diverse business cultures and opportunities across sectors and / or geographies.
Scope:
Target group(s): Vocational schools, higher education establishments, public authorities in the field of education and employment, SMEs, corporations.
The transforming economy and rapid development of technology have changed employment conditions and the set of skills needed to grow one’s own business. More than ever should educational institutions work hand in hand with the business sector to prepare students for a rapidly changing working environment by nurturing their entrepreneurial competences. Compared to dense areas around economic centres, the entrepreneurial skills and activity gap is bigger in peripheral areas with lower economic activity, confirming the importance of closely interlinked ecosystems for sustaining entrepreneurial activity and employment rates.
The Expanding Entrepreneurial Ecosystems should enhance entrepreneurial skills of youth in ‘modest’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems by supporting entrepreneurial education through programmes designed in closed collaboration with the private sector and business acceleration entities. The proposals should leverage on the best practices of the private sector in Europe’s well performing innovation hubs and the existing collaboration with educational institutions. Only by building local talents, including female talents, and providing them with knowledge and opportunities to contribute to the local private sector or develop their own businesses, the local innovation ecosystem can expand based on sustainable and inclusive growth. The proposals should valorise high levels of technical skills in developing innovation ecosystems with hands-on knowledge and experiences in business management and international scale-up process.
The action supports co-designed programmes of activities, of at least two (2) study years, proposed jointly by educational institutions from ‘modest’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems and the private sector from innovation hubs (‘strong innovators’ and ‘innovation leaders’)[2], to nurture entrepreneurial skills by activities, for example:
engagement of business experts into the implementation of educational programmes;
engagement of students and graduates from various disciplines and departments into the respective companies’ structures, and engagement of educational staff in companies’ business processes, both with a target of gender-balanced participation;
organisation of co-ideation challenges, where students can propose innovative solutions in the field of partners’ expertise and are provided with resources and support to develop the product and its business development strategy.
To ensure that the impact of the action goes beyond consortium members and their respective countries, it is encouraged that the consortium works closely with innovation agencies from their respective territories and beyond, and seeks for synergies with relevant EU initiatives such as the European Institute of Technology and Innovation.

","04 October 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased access to capital and investments in less connected innovation ecosystems, enhancing their openness, competitiveness, and global potential;
Increased venture investments and enabled late-stage growth of local start-ups in less connected and developing innovation ecosystems;
Facilitated investors’ access to the flow of local deals;
Improved investors’ knowledge on regulatory frameworks and networks to support joint cross-border ventures in new markets.
Scope:
Target group(s): Business-acceleration providers such as incubators, accelerators, company-builders, innovation agencies, business clubs and networks, public and private VCs and their networks, national and regional promotional banks.
The lack of funding is one of the most problematic aspects of business growth in less connected innovation ecosystems and there are huge disparities between company needs and the available funding. Existing interventions by public and private funders are limited and further resources are necessary to bridge the gap. The lack of funding is harmful for local start-ups’ survival rate and the development of regional scale-ups, especially for women-led companies. While the established European start-up hubs attract significant money and attention, the innovation ecosystems in other areas try to keep pace with fewer resources. In the struggle for resources, many start-ups face the choice to either close their business or move elsewhere, while foreign investors struggle to enter new markets due to insufficient information about the market, its opportunities and regulatory frameworks.
The Expanding Investments Ecosystems should attract foreign investors into “modest’ and ‘moderate’ innovation ecosystems by raising awareness of local innovation ecosystems and their start-ups, as well as the potential of the whole region, to capital providers from across Europe.
The action supports co-designed programmes of activities, of at least two (2) years, proposed by business acceleration service providers and/or investor networks and clubs, located in less connected innovation ecosystems (‘modest’ and ‘moderate’) and innovation hubs (‘strong innovators’ and innovation leaders’)[1], to facilitate the entry of funders in less connected innovation ecosystems through activities, for example:
market orientation / introduction programmes for European investors, including establishment of central points of information for foreign investors providing them with knowledge on the ecosystem's establishment conditions, incentives, tax and legislation;
assistance to foreign EU and international investors / Venture Capitalists, including women investors, during the whole process of investment, from the pre-entry stage until the exit, by ensuring support in administrative, legal, linguistic and cultural issues;
organisation of European and worldwide international business forums, conferences and events to attract and connect international with local investors;
peer-matching of investors and other networking activities to encourage joint ventures;
a repository of best practices of market entry facilitation for international investors;
a list of recommendations for local authorities and European regulators to better address investors’ entry challenges and facilitate cross-border deals.
To ensure that the impact of the action goes beyond consortium members and their respective countries, it is encouraged that the consortium works closely with innovation agencies from their respective territories and beyond, and seeks for synergies with relevant EU initiatives such as the Enterprise Europe Network.

With their 14% of GDP purchasing power are not only potential launching customers of innovative solutions, they can also drive innovation by asking the market to develop new ones (market research and engagement) and by co-financing the innovation process (pre-commercial procurement, procurement of Research and Development services, Competitive Dialogue, Innovation Partnership, etc.). There are a number of obstacles, which prevent public buyers from buying innovative solutions: insufficient administrative capacity, lack of awareness, legal challenges in the transposition into Member State legislation, and risk-adverse approach to procurement, important differences among Member States but also among various level of buyers, e.g. local, regional, national and depending on the sector (health, infrastructure, education, municipality services, etc.). Similarly, the reach and benefits of innovation procurement procedures, in terms of results and outputs, are very often limited to the direct beneficiary, rather than spill-over more widely, even in the regional and/or national context.
The applicants are encouraged to consider a project duration of at least five (5) years and the proposals should focus on strategic oriented joint innovation programmes (multi-annual action plans), that will include activities aimed to enable national and/or regional and/or local authorities and/or municipalities, in association with the public and private buyers, to:
develop long-term innovation procurement policy frameworks and integration of innovation procurement in sectoral policies;
develop action plans, including spending targets and monitoring system to be implemented by different levels of public authorities; develop a set of incentives mechanisms to stimulate innovation procurement;
develop and improve data collection and monitoring of results to demonstrate the positive long-term impact for society in adopting the innovative solutions;
design a strategy and supporting tools for the further exploitation of the results and outputs of innovation procurement procedures by other EU actors;
support matchmaking, brokering and expertise gathering entities (including specialised buyers, facilitators/brokers, competence centres) at national but also at regional/city or sector level encouraging dialogue and co-design;
create and establish capacity in Member States and Associated Countries, support the competence building and preparation of innovation procurement (including legal advice, tender preparation, training);
contribute to the development of innovative solutions/products (development of product benchmarks, setting up of piloting spaces);
facilitate exchange of best practices on the legal set up, design and implementation of innovative public procurement.

","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Non-conventional energy sources, such as microwave, plasma, ultrasound and laser, as well as electrochemical and photochemical processes, have already been applied in process intensification, mainly at lab scale, showing significant improvements in process performance (e.g. improved selectivity, crystal nucleation, reaction speed easing raw material demand) for the benefit of energy efficiency. The processes powered by non-conventional energy sources are suitable for connection to the electricity grid. They allow variable throughputs to better follow market demand and enable leaner production paradigms (e.g. decreased stock, production on demand). Such technologies are suitable for downscaling and continuous processing, where they can also be coupled with real time monitoring allowing a finer control of the transformations.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to develop technologies applying non-conventional energy sources to processes of high industrial interest. The concepts proposed should:
Show potential for integration in a renewable electricity grid, and consider the relevant limitations (fluctuating nature of the electricity stream);
Provide significant advantages in terms of resource and energy efficiency, compared to the current state of the art processes (or similar ones, as relevant);
Provide improved flexibility, working at variable throughputs without major losses in the overall process performance;
Be applicable to continuous processes and/or show potential enabling the replacement of current batch ones;
Consider, where relevant, the possibility for containerised and/or mobile (e.g. biomass in situ processing) technologies;
Consider Life Cycle Assessment proving a reduced environmental footprint;
Consider replicability and scalability of the proposed concepts.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Allowing for a -30% to +30% energy input within RES fluctuations timeframes, without significant losses in specific energy efficiency;
Improvement in energy efficiency of 30%;
Improvement in resource efficiency of 30%;
Decrease in CO2 emissions by 40% (without considering the electricity generation and at steady state);
Decreased OPEX and CAPEX by 15%;
Effective dissemination of major innovation outcomes to the current and the next generation of employees of the SPIRE sectors, through the development of learning resources with flexible usability. These should be ready to be easily integrated in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programs.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

Specific challenge: The EU, together with ESA, initiated the high-level platform for space exploration with three dedicated international high level conferences at ministerial level (i.e. Prague in 2009, Brussels in 2010, and Lucca in 2011). The next conference will be hosted by the United States in January 2014. One of the potential outcomes of the International Space Exploration Forum (ISEF) as proposed by Europe is to advance towards the identification of possible future collaboration domains building on technology “demonstrator projects,” to be proposed by one or more actors and linked to exploration missions.
Scope: This topic will allow implementing the technology “demonstrator projects” to be initiated after the ISEF meeting. These demonstrator projects would target underpinning enabling technologies for space exploration, notably robotics, novel energy production and storage, propulsion or life support, as well as atmosphere entry, return/re-entry vehicles or communication and data handling systems. Actors, including international partners, interested to participate to such demonstrator projects could form clusters around several technology “demonstrator projects”. Technology demonstrator projects open to international partnerships would allow developing cutting edge space technology making an important success factor for European researchers and industry.
In line with the objectives of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012) 497) and the Commission Staff Working Document “A Role for Europe within a Global Space Exploration Endeavour” preparing for a European position for ISEF, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries active in space exploration.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impacts: Clusters around technology “demonstrator project” would meet and discuss how to build such projects, including governance, technical appraisal, costing aspects and possible funding arrangements. Workshops and information events should be part of the activity. Concrete results and further steps may be presented at the next ISEF meeting.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The space sector is a strategic asset contributing to the independence, security and prosperity of Europe and its role in the world. Europe needs non-dependent access to critical space technologies, which is a conditio-sine-qua-non for achieving Europe’s strategic objectives. ""Non-dependence"" refers to the possibility for Europe to have free, unrestricted access to any required space technology. Whenever possible multiple (>1) sources for the critical technologies shall be promoted across Europe. Reaching non-dependence in certain technologies will open new markets to our industries and will increase the overall competitiveness of the European Space sector.
Scope:
Research in technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness has been undertaken within the frame of the Joint EC-ESA-EDA Task Force on Critical Technologies for European non-Dependence, launched in 2008. The Joint Task Force recently updated the list of actions for 2015-2017[1].
Activities shall address technologies identified on the list of Actions for 2015/2017 focusing on those areas that have not so far benefitted from prior Framework Programme funding and representing the highest potential for being implemented through the types of action available in Horizon 2020.
Accordingly, the following priority technologies have been identified:
U14 - Active discrete power components.
U18 - Enhanced performance and space qualified detectors.
U19 - High speed DAC-ADC based on European technology.
U20 - Very high performance microprocessors.
U22 - ASICS: Deep Sub-Micron (DSM).
N27 - RF components.
Technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries and proposals are expected to provide advanced critical technologies that are of common interest to different space application domains (e.g. telecom, Earth-observation, science, etc.), or even with applicability to terrestrial domains.
Proposals should strive to go beyond the present state-of-the-art or, preferably, the expected state of the art at the time of completion if alternative technologies are being developed outside Europe. High level specifications and key requirements can be found in the list of actions for 2015-2017.
Proposals should include a work package dedicated to the development of a commercial evaluation of the technology, and should address how to access the commercial market with a full range (preload) of recurring products.
A maximum of one proposal per identified priority technology line will be selected for funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
Expected Impact:
Reduce the dependence on critical technologies and capabilities from outside Europe for future space applications, as identified in the list of Actions for 2015/2017 as part of the Joint EC-ESA-EDA task force on Critical Technologies;
Develop, or regain in the mid-term, the European capacity to operate independently in space, e.g. by developing in a timely manner reliable and affordable space technologies that in some cases may already exist outside Europe or in European terrestrial applications;
Enhance the technical capabilities and overall competitiveness of European space industry satellite vendors on the worldwide market;
Open new competition opportunities for European manufacturers by reducing the dependency on export restricted technologies that are of strategic importance to future European space efforts;
Enable the European industry to get non-restricted access to high performance technologies that will allow increasing its competitiveness and expertise in the space domain;
Improve the overall European space technology landscape and complement the activities of European and national space programmes;
Greater industrial relevance of research actions and output as demonstrated by deeper involvement of industry, including SMEs, and stronger take-up of research results;
Fostering links between academia and industry, accelerating and broadening technology transfer.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs within the Space domain with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of this domain.
Scope: Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of Space. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to the Space domain as well as to gender dimension of Research and Innovation, and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the Space part of Horizon 2020 and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Science with and for Society’.
Only NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries and other space faring nations and ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and motivated NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and  the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission considers that one proposal requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
•           An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
•           A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.
•           More effective participation of SMEs and of organisations from third countries, alongside European organisations, in line with the principles of mutual benefit.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Today, it is a critical challenge for Europe to establish a level playing field with its global competitors and support activities to bridge the digital gap across European regions and deliver broadband and telecommunications services to under-served areas and populations.
In the mid to long-term, the competitiveness of the space sector and its ability to serve EU policies, notably the Digital Single Market, depends on the continuous integration of pertinent technologies and the availability of demonstrated/validated systems and sub-systems. While European companies have managed to capture a significant share of the global commercial telecommunications satellite market, technological advances must consolidate competitive positions. An objective of the sector is to move towards the Terabit satellite systems (space and ground segment). Other approaches target constellations in lower Earth orbit.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to demonstrate, in a relevant environment, technologies, systems and sub-systems for satellite communications. The proposed work should address and demonstrate significant improvements in miniaturisation, power reduction, efficiency, performance, flexibility, resilience, versatility, security and/or increased functionality and should demonstrate complementarity to activities already funded by Member States and the European Space Agency (e.g. the ARTES programme).
Proposals that demonstrate technologies targeting TRL 6 are welcome.
In this context, proposals are sought with relevance for space in the following fields:
Advanced communication technologies for feeder or service links, preparing satellite networking in the Terabit-throughput including optical communication and RF communication at high frequencies (Q/V/W). Optical communication technologies will indicatively include laser communication terminals for ground and satellite segment. This could include transmitter and receiver technologies, hybrid RF-photonic technologies, pointing and tracking approaches, ground station design, site diversity technique to adapt to weather conditions, turbulence mitigation techniques (like Adaptive Optics, Predistortion and Transmitter Diversity), gateway management and interface with ground networks.
Photonics technology (for high capacity reconfigurable payloads).
Active antennas building blocks at different frequencies up to Ka/Ku bands and higher, GaN SSPA - Solid State Power Amplifier.
Flexible repeater (equipment enabling flexible frequency plans, flexible channelization, evolution to new RF bands such as Q- and V-band, etc.).
Reconfigurable coverages, flexible interbeam connectivity, antijamming and interference mitigation techniques, on-board spectrum monitoring, interference management and support for full duplex relaying.
New generation of waveforms and related protocols, as well as photonic building blocks and technologies, devoted to seamless integration of SatCom Systems with terrestrial networks (including hybrid terrestrial-satellite network architectures) with specific focus on mobile machine to machine (m2m) applications, high-security communication services, future internet architectures, SDN and Cloud Computing paradigms, and security needs.
End to end system enablers in telecommunications: technical enablers to increase the security, efficiency and performance of satellite-based communications solutions for weather conditions adaptation and optimisation of EO data distribution.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
Expected Impact:
Increase the maturity level of key satellite communication technologies with clear and measurable progress over the state of the art in terms of step changes in technical capabilities, as evidenced by improvements in performance.
Contributing by 2020 to a more competitive positioning of satellite communication manufacturers in the marketplace, in terms of their penetration in new or emerging markets.

Support the development of scientific instrumentation for science and exploration missions (including planetary exploration missions) enabling increased cooperation between scientists, engineering teams, industry and SMEs across Europe.
Scope:
Scientific instrumentation is understood in this context as mission payloads that perform scientific tasks. Proposals may cover different stages of development of scientific instrumentation from concepts, to breadboarding and prototype demonstration. Proposals are particularly welcome that develop novel and advanced technologies, such as new sensors and other sub-systems that may be used in scientific instrumentation. Projects supported through this call should address planned and future European scientific and exploration missions, as well as collaboration in the context of third country missions as a European contribution to global efforts.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The integration of scientific teams with engineering and industrial teams will stimulate new and improved instrumentation designs and lead to potential opportunities for spin-in/spin-out effects between space and non-space technology fields. This research topic should attract also active participation of researchers in academia and SMEs."

Space weather services exist already today in Europe and in several countries outside the EU. New services are also being developed (e.g. in ESA’s SSA programme and in EU Seventh Framework Programme projects). Their goal is to observe and to predict a range of solar events that may impact the near Earth environment including orbiting satellites and ground based systems. However there is a lack of understanding of the effects of space weather on space systems including spacecrafts, payloads and living organisms in space as well as on ground-based infrastructure.
Scope:
Exploratory work studying space weather with a view to enhancing the understanding of space weather and its impact. Proposals can cover the full range of space weather phenomena from the solar cycle, flares and coronal mass ejections to the effects of the solar wind in the near-earth environment and the evolution in between. There is scope for cooperation with international partners with relevant expertise (entities from third countries could benefit from EU funding under this topic).
This activity shall address space weather and its effects, impacts and mitigation techniques with application to aerospace and ground systems.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to improve the understanding of Space Weather phenomena and their impact on space systems and terrestrial infrastructure, and are also expected to analyse viable mitigation strategies, and to demonstrate how these add value compared to existing mitigation strategies.

Deadline date","Scope:
By using purchasing power to choose socially responsible goods, services and works, public authorities at different levels can set a positive example and encourage enterprises to make wider use of social standards in the management, production and provision of services.
Socially responsible public procurement provides incentives to companies to develop socially responsible products and services.
At EU level, the 2014 EU public procurement legal framework[1] entered into force in April 2016, opening up new opportunities for public authorities to promote socially responsible public procurement. A number of projects have been launched in order to encourage public authorities to include social clause to their purchasing procedures.
However, implementing socially responsible public procurement in practice remains a challenge and experience shows that the opportunities arising from the existing legal framework are still insufficiently used. In addition, different regional/local public authorities, given their competencies in the field and specific conditions, address this challenge with different approach and different success level.
The ""Socially Responsible Public Procurement (SRPP) Mission” will bring together a county accompanied by social economy stakeholders experienced in SRPP on one side and those counties accompanied by social economy stakeholders interested in the topic. The SRPP Mission will enable presentation and interrogation of the success story in more details, it will help to identify its successes and challenges and to understand existing procurement practices in other partner counties. It will provide a platform for exchange of views on more developed collaboration in the field.

Targeted awareness-raising campaigns and a number of different actions and projects for social economy stakeholders implemented at EU, national, regional and local level can contribute significantly to the raising interest in the topic of social economy and increased number of the recognised social economy stakeholders in recent years.
However, lack of systematic approach to the social economy model originates from insufficient supportive educational schemes. An unexplored potential of education and its impact on social economy community building and awareness-raising is enormous.
At the European level, to enable young people to take full advantage of the cooperative enterprise option, the European Commission decided to launch a preparatory action on that topic in 2019 to address challenges in that area entitled “Reducing youth unemployment: setting up co-operatives to enhance working opportunities in the EU”. The action will help to diffuse the cooperative concept and values towards young people. It will be complementary to projects aiming at boosting cooperative entrepreneurship currently being implemented under ERASMUS +https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/growth/item-detail.cfm?item_id=648248

Deadline date","Scope:
The specific objective of this call in relation to SMEs is to improve their access to markets inside the Union. Access to public procurement remains difficult for SMEs, who are only awarded 45% of the value of public contracts above EU public procurement threshold. This share is clearly below their weight in the economy.
The public sector can play a large role in helping companies, and in particular SMEs, overcome a classic market failure: finding a first group of customers for their innovative products and services. Innovation is constrained by a 'chicken or egg problem,' whereby suppliers will often wait until there is a demonstrated demand before they develop new solutions, while at the same time the potential buyers are waiting to see a new product or service enjoying some success in the market before they will risk buying it themselves (Cate et al, 1998)
This call for proposals is expected to contribute to a significant increase in the proportion of SMEs that have access to the public procurement market. It will also increase the visibility and awareness of the advantages of procuring innovation for a constantly increasing greater number of public buyers.
This call for proposals has three main objectives.
The first objective is to encourage cooperation between public buyers to promote the use of public procurement to contribute to the development of innovation.
The second objective is to use public procurement as a mechanism to pilot innovation in areas of strong public interest such as, for instance, clean energy (contributing to Paris targets for fighting climate change) or healthcare. This will in turn encouraging innovative EU companies, in particular SMEs, to develop new solutions to address societal challenges.
The third objective is to link and establish synergies with research and innovation projects funded by the EU (via Horizon 2020, COSME or EU funding programmes) whenever possible.

          To strengthen cooperation between EU and other countries and regions of the
world by combining political meetings with a business dimension (dooropening/
prepare steps to match-finding) on enterprise and industry policy issues.
          To enhance cooperation in areas of mutual interest of Enterprise & Industry Policy
(through signature of political documents in various sectors such as industrial
cooperation, innovation, standardisation, clusters, entrepreneurship, raw materials,
SMEs, space, tourism).
          To better understand the business climate in other countries and regions of the
world, promote business/investments there – seen through the lenses of European
business, EU officials get a better understanding of business environment in other
countries.
         To promote the internationalisation of European companies, including SMEs.
         To show and promote Europe as an investment opportunity for business: the
external marketing of Europe’s internal market.
Further information on these missions can be obtained at the following link:
http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/initiatives/mission-growth/missions-for-growth/.
In the year 2015, further four Missions for Growth could be organised (dates and
destinations to be defined). The European Commission can support a project enabling the
mobilisation of companies for two of these Missions via, inter alia, the network of national
trade promotion organisations.
The following categories of actions should be included in the offer:
1) the selection of companies in specific industrial sectors;
2) preparation of the business-to-business events with the companies from the third
countries including company training;
3) follow-up of the missions, including the evaluation of the mission results.
It is important that the project guarantees, via national trade promotion organisations
and/or other intermediary organisations, a coverage of all 28 EU Member States.

The objective of the European mini-slate development support is to foster the competitiveness of European independent production companies and to increase their economic weight on the market. The aim is also to increase the capacity of audiovisual producers to develop projects with the potential to circulate throughout Europe and beyond, and to facilitate European and international coproduction.
The support will also provide an entry point for emerging talent, giving them the opportunity to direct a short film supported by the strong foundation provided by experienced companies.
Expected results
A stronger position on European and international markets for companies selected under European mini-slate development.
Increased quality, feasibility, cross-border potential and market value of European works supported.
Description of the activities to be funded
Support will be given to independent European production companies able to develop a slate of 2 to 3 audiovisual works (fiction, animation, creative documentary). This should allow production companies to reduce risks and increase their capacity to attract and retain talents.
The European mini-slate development shall provide support to the development of minimum 2 and maximum 3 works for commercial exploitation intended for cinema release, television broadcasting or commercial exploitation on digital platforms or a multi-platform environment in the following categories: animation, creative documentary or fiction. Applicants may add a short film by emerging talent to their slate (optional).
The aim is to provide funds to audiovisual production companies to develop work with high creative value and cultural diversity and wide cross-border exploitation potential. Companies are encouraged to develop strategies for marketing and distribution from the outset of the development phase thus improving the potential to reach audiences at a European and international level.
Greater cooperation, including co-development, between operators from different countries participating in the MEDIA Strand is also pursued as well as strengthening the competitiveness of European audiovisual production companies by consolidating their capacity for investment in the development phase and expanding companies’ activities and their innovation capacity to explore new fields and markets.
Special attention will be given to applications presenting adequate strategies to ensure a more sustainable and more environmentally-respectful industry and to ensure gender balance, inclusion, diversity and representativeness."

Specific challenge:
Increasing resilience to crises and disasters requires an orchestrated set of actions, including standardisation. While dedicated research projects and new topics look into different aspects of resilience to be investigated and further developed, at the same time related opportunities and needs for standardisation to support disaster resilience have to be addressed. Such standardisation activities could e.g. significantly improve the technical, procedural, operational and semantic interoperability of command, control and communication systems for crisis and disaster management, or the interoperability of detection equipment and tools in the areas of CBRNE. An analysis of European standardisation needs has been carried out within the Mandate M487 to establish Security Standards, which has led to the identification of standardisation priorities, for three selected security sectors (CBRNE, Crisis Management, Border Security). Similar trends are developed worldwide, which opens the scope for international cooperation. Besides this, research is needed on a longer term to identify and further elaborate potential standardisation opportunities in other technological and non-technological areas where a significant contribution to improve the disaster resilience through standardisation can be expected.
Scope:
Proposals need to assess the feasibility and the expected impact of proposed standardisation activities that are not included in the sectors identified by the M487 Mandate (focusing on European Norms), including standards that could be developed at international level, the appropriate standardisation deliverable(s) and the expected time frame to finish the proposed activity. Relevant legislation on EU and Member State level, as well as international regulations, need to be taken into account appropriately, including potential ethical, societal and privacy issues of the proposed activities. Proposals need to show how duplication of efforts with relevant past or on-going research projects, and standardisation activities on European (e.g. CEN/TC 391) and international level (e.g. ISO/TC 223) will be avoided: how proposed activities will be coordinated with other, relevant activities like e.g. the EU action on enhancing the resilience of infrastructures[1], how a cross-fertilisation of work between the proposal and these relevant activities will be achieved and how the proposal consortium intends to involve itself in relevant CEN and/or ISO TC’s through international cooperation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €1m and €2m EUR would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going work within the European Framework Cooperation (EFC) should be taken into account.
Expected impact:
- better assessment of feasibility and impact of standards in the identified areas;
- establishment of a standardisation roadmap at international (ISO) and European (EN) levels;
- improved coordination of activities at EU and international levels and cross-fertilisation among different sectors;
- improved complementary contribution to disaster resilience of populations, crisis and disaster management / civil protection and/or CBRNE systems, tools and services:
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as standardization bodies, security agents in the CBRNE area and civil protection units.
Up to one project will be co-funded.

Specific challenge:
To increase Europe’s resilience to crises and disasters is a topic of highest political concern in the EU and its Member States and Associated Countries. This concerns both man-made threats (accidents, terrorism) and natural hazards such as e.g. floods, storms, earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis.While the term ‘resilience’ can be described as “The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions.” (UNISDR, 2009), it is necessary to break down and practically apply this definition to the different security sectors. Resilience concepts namely need to be developed for critical infrastructures (supply of basic services like water, food, energy, transport, housing/ shelter, communications, finance, health), but also for the wider public to integrate and address human and social dynamics in crises and disaster situations, including the role of the population, the media, rescuers (staff, volunteers and ad-hoc volunteers). . Resilience concepts need also to take into account the necessity to anticipate, to plan and to implement in the crises time a substitution process aiming to deal with a lack of material, technical or human resources or capacities necessary to assume the continuity of basic functions and services until recovery from negative effects and until return to the nominal position.
Resilience concepts need also to take into account the necessity to anticipate, to plan and to implement a substitution process in a crisis or disaster, aiming to deal with a lack of material, technical or human resources or capacities necessary to assume the continuity of basic functions and services until recovery from negative effects and return to the normal situation. Moreover, as resilience management and vulnerability reduction are closely related, it is necessary to link the on-going efforts link and share EU-wide risk assessment and mapping approaches[1], e.g. physical exposure mapping with relevant resilience management approaches, to ensure that risk assessment is followed by the development of resilience concepts in the various security sectors, based on the results of the risk assessments.
Scope:
Proposals should first survey worldwide approaches how to define, develop, implement and evaluate resilience concepts, including relevant EU sectoral approaches. In a second step, promising implementation approaches and elements should be identified which can be adapted to one or more of the above mentioned critical infrastructures, and/or the public, and assessed regarding their potential to serve as a basis for a general guideline on resilience assessment and implementation. In a third step, such a general resilience management guideline should be developed, linked with the EU Risk Assessment Guidelines, and operationalized in one or more of the security sectors, and/or the public. The successful pilot implementation of the developed guideline need to be demonstrated and tested in an operational environment, e.g. Air Traffic Management, electricity grids, gas transmission networks or space infrastructures, or other appropriate infrastructures.
This pilot implementation should include a dedicated risk assessment and risk management approach, addressing e.g. the issue of cascading effects. Proposals need to show that the proposed research does not overlap with activities proposed under the current “Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security Related Risks” (CIPS) [2] programme and its successor in the Internal Security Fund, and that it is linked to the “European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection” (EPCIP) programme[3] and its new revised approach. Findings from relevant Seventh Framework Programme projects need to be taken into account, and integrated into the research where possible. Furthermore, a close collaboration with the major EU demonstration project on aftermath crisis management (SEC-2013.4.1-1, expected to start in 2014) should be sought, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and to facilitate cross-project contributions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact:
-          the development of European Resilience Management Guideline and demonstration through pilot implementation;
-          more efficient uptake of risk assessments through Member States and Associated Countries and Critical Infrastructure Providers; and
-          more effective and coherent crises and disaster resilience management, including improved trainings for rescuers and population engagement.
 The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as civil protection units, first responders and critical infrastructure providers.

Specific challenge:
As the EU, the  Member States, Associated Countries and the EU Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs)  progress towards the development of appropriate responses for adapting to climate change, there is a pressing need for developing a coherent research and innovation agenda, to provide:
         The coordination and the clustering of research and innovation activities on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation in different sectors, also in relation to long-term risk reduction from extreme weather events;
         A more standardised basis (including transferable, widely applicable tools and methods) for assessing potential climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, costs, benefits, risks and opportunities;
         A strengthened knowledge base, through a more coherent approach to the identification and assessment of the performance and impacts of different adaptation measures, with a view to prioritise relevant interventions;
         Support for the development of innovative adaptation and long term risk reduction options, fine-tuned to specific natural and socio-economic conditions across Europe, with the aim to protect and reduce the vulnerability of sensitive resources, economic sectors, green and technical infrastructure, and society from climate-change related threats.
Scope:Proposals must address one of the following (a,b):
a) Coordination and support actions [2014][1]
Proposals should aim to:
Developa platform to organise consultations and facilitate dialogue among different stakeholder groups at the EU and Associated countries level and at different geographical scales, throughout the duration of Horizon 2020, paying due attention to, and establishing linkages with international developments in the field; as well as
Support clustering and close cooperation among international, EU and nationally funded initiatives in the field of climate change adaptation, and disaster risk reduction, promote foresight and large-scale dissemination activities, and foster the science-policy interface across the EU.
The action is expected to proactively target coordination needs and requirements of end-users, such as the Commission services dealing with climate change adaptation, EU, national, regional and local authorities that manage a prospective research agenda in this field, as well as key actors that participate in the development and implementation of adaptation strategies and in the mainstreaming of adaptation requirements into sectoral plans.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between the range of 2 to 3 million euro would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Up to one proposal will be selected for funding.
b) Research and innovation actions [2014]
Proposals should aim to:
Develop standardised methods to assess climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, and risks, and to identify and assess the performance of adaptation measures (technological and non-technological options). Methods should focus on long-term climate change and extreme events for European sectors of particular socio-economic and environmental significance, paying due consideration to uncertainty, and encompass indirect, cross-sectoral effects and cascade impacts, where relevant.
Provide state-of-the-art decision support tools tailored to facilitate decision-making by different end-users (e.g. individuals, businesses, other private sector firms, local authorities and planners, governments), while developing adaptation plans and measures.
The ambition of the challenge suggests that proposals with a requested EC contribution in the range of €6 million to €8 million (or more) may be appropriate. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
a) Better coordination, dissemination and communication of research and innovation activities on disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and synergies among EU-funded (e.g. ClimateAdapt, Climate KIC, FP projects), Member State-funded (e.g. JPIs, national programmes) and international activities in the field (e.g. UNEP/PROVIA).
b) Improved and concise information for decision making (at both public and private sectors) on climate change impacts, disaster risks and relevant options to address them. Enhanced implementation in the medium-term of the EU Adaptation Strategy and national and local efforts towards climate-proofing of key European economic sectors and services, as well as of the EU Disaster Prevention Framework.

Specific Challenge:
Governance regimes tend to lack integration when facing large-scale disaster events. State-civil society relationships, economic organization, and societal transitions have implications for disaster management. Various measures can be employed to assess management and resilience of major natural and man-made disasters. However, more research is needed in this field of study on factors that contribute to effective management of major disasters and crisis, including risk analysis and cost modelling. In particular, demonstration is needed to further improve on-field management of international and humanitarian crises operations, civil protection assistance, including deployment (before and after a crisis) of EU teams, materials and services (humanitarian logistics), possibly repatriation of EU citizens.
Scope:
The demo should aim at demonstrating the EU deployable disaster and crisis management capabilities to be applied in real situations outside the EU (in typical crisis scenarios in which damaged and poor infrastructure exist and distance to the crisis will require fast response with the deployment of support facilities and equipment and evacuation of personnel). The proposals should investigate the consequences of poor and/or late situational awareness reducing the ability to comprehend the scale of a crisis, they should evaluate means to improve and restore situation awareness and communication with the in-situ teams (police forces, civil protection, etc.), and should take into account the identification of risk areas and vulnerable groups, especially for people with mobility, hearing and sight problems. Proposals should explore the cost-saving effect of comprehensive risk and threat prevention systems as well as the management cycle from the detection of a crisis event, the planning of actions and the prioritization of efforts through the mobilization of responders to the delivery of information to the responders on site. It should combine dynamic data (from sensors, aerial networks etc.) with static information (maps, infrastructure, assessment templates) keeping in mind the security of the information exchanged. Interoperability should be considered as well as health, environmental, climatic, dual-use, legal and ethical aspects.
The implementation of this crisis demonstration programme is expected to link policy, research and end-users in order to make it useful at the end, thus directly contributing to improving cooperation between science and society. It should bridge the current gaps and allow testing and validating research solutions that a later stage could be applied directly for disaster management.
Sound governance and a good knowledge of resilience factors are crucial during large scale disasters due to the involvement of a large number of actors and the uncertainty and lack of information that characterises major identified disasters and crisis. This is even more acute for situations outside the EU. In order to prepare solutions for an improved coordination, the demo should identify and take into account comprehensive and representative scenarios that will trigger as many aspects of the different crisis situations as possible, involving the tactical, operational and strategic level.
The population is always a key actor in crises and disasters, both as the affected and as the very first source of response. Enhancing the disaster resilience of societies in relation to EU external assets means first and foremost preparing the population, thus a strong citizen focus should be an important driver of the demo. In this sense, social networks and their particularities in terms of communications could be taken into account, in particular in the way they can be used for improving large scale disaster management.
Cost-efficiency should be introduced in all aspects of the disaster management activities. As such the demo should include it as a key factor (best use of available resources). In particular, the costs of coordination activities and logistics and the cost-effectiveness of disaster prevention and preparedness should be addressed with special care, reinforcing mutual confidence with a rationalisation of end-user's resources.
The demo should present a ""next generation"" approach to the problems targeted and solutions offered, demonstrating a clear innovative approach, going beyond activities already conducted within the EU.
The demo should build on existing tools and results of completed and on-going Seventh Framework Programme and national projects, and combining them with legacy systems and tools. Knowledge and experiences from other fields such as health, environment, climate change, transport etc. could be useful and could be brought into the demo if relevant. Finally, lessons learnt from past incidents, preparedness activities and simulations should also pave the way for future actions.
The demo should give importance to integrating adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in on-going discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities. Funding for third countries is however still subject to the evaluations.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going work within the European Framework Cooperation (EFC) should be taken into account.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €10m and €20m EUR would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
- increasing our capacity to anticipate, prepare and respond to disasters occurring outside the EU - including those potentially affecting EU external assets - through better risk assessments, monitoring and planning, including an improved use of existing assets and logistics;
- enhanced capability to deploy disaster and crisis management assets in real situations outside the EU;
- faster assessment and feedback of data to coordination centres and communication including communication and database interoperability issues;
- improved prevention, preparedness, response in line with the EU and the UN approach to Disaster Risk Reduction;
- enabling a better risk assessment and improved decision-making;
- improved communication and coordination of response actions and sharing of information with the public;
- boosting the competitiveness and visibility of EU disaster and crisis management services.
The action will also contribute to:
- support EU policy priorities in the area of disaster and crisis management , where serious major disasters or crisis require immediate action and that may affect the lives, infrastructures, the environment and EU external assets.
- contribute to the general orientations of the post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction (HFA2) coordinated by the United Nations International Strategy for Risk Reduction in which the EU is a working party;
- take into account the recently adopted legislation on the Civil Protection Mechanism.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as national and local law enforcement agencies, civil protection units and first responders.

Specific Challenge:
Emerging diseases and their pandemic potential pose a great security threat at national and EU level, particularly in the era of globalization when disease can spread more rapidly than in previous eras. Thirty four percent of all deaths worldwide are now attributable to infectious disease, while war only accounts for 0.64 percent of those deaths. Improving capacity-building is key to fight epidemics and the European Union must increase its efforts to improve domestic and global risk assessment, surveillance, communication capability and governance. Additionally, reducing disease transmission through public education and related measures is also crucial to minimizing pandemic impacts, i.e. for health security and protection in case of large-scale pandemics, further capacity-building is essential.
Scope:
Based on the consolidation and exploitation of results, tools and systems from previous R&D efforts and building on existing projects, the overall aim is to develop viable innovative concepts. Approaches should integrate relevant research as well as aspects related to risk assessment, communication, education and governance, thus contributing to improve cooperation between science and society. Concepts should be developed with a view to cross-border approaches. The proposal should aim at identifying gaps and research and priorities to be addressed in a second phase focusing on demonstration.

Specific challenge:
Extreme weather and climate events, interacting with exposed and vulnerable human and natural systems, can lead to disasters. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), some types of extreme events (e.g. flash floods and related landslides, storm surges, heatwaves, fires, including vegetation fires) have increased in frequency or magnitude, and in the meantime populations and assets at risk have also increased, leading to greater disaster risks. In order to better forecastand manage the immediate consequences of weather- and climate-related disasters, in particular regarding emergency responses, improved measures and technologies are needed.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on the potential of current and new measures (including local measures) and technologies to enhance the response capacity to extreme weather and climate events  affecting the security of people and assets. Proposals should focus on emergency management operations and cover the whole crisis management, linking awareness and early warning to effective responses within society and coordination with first responders, including the use of adapted cyber technologies to gain time and improve coordination in emergency situations. Proposals should also explore the links and eventual adjustments of the warning and response systems facing the observed or anticipated changes in frequency and intensity of extreme climate events.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €5m and €12m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities.

Expected impact:
- more effective and faster emergency responses to extreme weather and climate events; Faster analysis of risks and anticipation;
- publicly available online now- and fore-casting systems for disasters triggered by (extreme) weather conditions;
- improved coordination of emergency reactions in the field, including the use of adapted cyber technologies;
- improved capacity to provide adequate emergency responses to extreme weather and climate events;
- shorter reaction time and higher efficiency of reactions;
- enhancement of citizen's protection and saving lives. The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as national law enforcement agencies, climate and weather services, civil protection units and public and private operators of critical infrastructures and networks.

Specific challenge:
A fast detection of exposure or contamination with CBRN substances (including toxins) using traceable toolsand rapid identification of critically exposed individuals  is essential to gain time in the triage of victims in case of accidents or terrorist attack. Research on traceability and monitoring of a large number of people in case of a massive CBRN incident is therefore needed to differentiate between contaminated and/or exposed persons and those individuals not contaminated persons on-site or in hospital zones.
Scope:
The objective of this topic is to integrate existing tools and procedures along with the development of novel solutions in order to rapidly determine, in case of accidents or terrorist attack, if victims have been exposed/contaminated or not (by a CBRN agent) as well as the level of contamination / exposure (including making use of point of care diagnostic tests), develop and establish a decontamination / treatment / medical follow up based on the level of contamination / exposure, ensure the tools and procedures fit in overarching search & rescue systems, establish guidelines for hospitalisation and admission to intensive care units (or other specific units) based on the contamination evaluation. A special attention should be given to gender, ethical, religious and privacy aspects, for instance for pregnant women, disabled individuals, etc. The ethical implications and social acceptance of the proposed solution needs to be studied, contributing to an improved cooperation between science and society. Dual-use aspects will be considered with possible synergies being established with the European Defence Agency. Existing networks of end users from all affected fields (e.g. defence/security experts, firemen, rescuers) need to be actively involved in both technologies and procedures.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €5m and €12m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
-          faster and more efficient treatments, detection and monitoring technologies of exposure to or contamination with CBRN substances (including toxins)  in the case of accidents or terrorist attacks;
-          new integrated, interoperable and centralised system to improve the triage and monitoring of victims, including the reduction of risks of cross-contamination between non-contaminated and contaminated victims.
-          improved CBRN (including toxins) detection and monitoring capabilities;
-          improved crisis management in case of a mass contamination/exposure through integration of information via a centralised system, involving all relevant stakeholders.
-          improved cooperation between science and society through ethical screening of the developed solutions;
-          higher cost-efficiency through dual-use applications;
-          contribution to ongoing standardisation work.
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as national law enforcement agencies, first responders and civil protection units in the CBRN area.

Specific challenge:
The Lisbon Treaty contains specific and important changes regarding Civil Protection that provide competence to the EU to: a) carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of Member States and Associated Countries at national, regional and local level in risk prevention in preparing their civil-protection personnel and in responding to natural or man-made disasters within the Union; b) promote swift effective cooperative action within the EU between national civil protection services; c) promote consistency in international civil protection actions. A comprehensive European approach on security issues based on the capitalization of knowledge existing at EU and national level will considerably help the development and implementation of civil protection decision-making solutions.
 Scope:
The proposals should carry out a survey leading to a mapping of new and promising civil protection decision-making solutions developed in the Seventh Framework and national programmes in transnational crisis and disaster management situations, including in fast developing and changing distaster and crisis situations.
 Proposals should prepare the ground for a future PCP for civil protection solutions, including public-private cooperation at local, national and EU level, with a view to test technological solutions and protection, deployment and intervention equipments (e.g. tents, relief equipments, basis needs supply, Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS)), sensors and tools (e.g. situation awareness) in order to make them more cost effective and interoperable.
 Expected impact:
-          create a network of potential procurers, including through the exchange of experiences between (public) stakeholders on civil protection and;
-          initiate a concrete debate on the mid-to-long term public needs that would require the development of new civil protection technology solutions with a potential role for pre-commercial procurement strategies;
-          create a roadmap for a future PCP topic to be included for an upcoming Horizon 2020 Secure Societies research call;

Specific challenge: The ability to assess, manage, reduce, mitigate and accept risk is paramount for an effective protections against cybersecurity threats and incidents. The dependence of networks and information systems, that are essential for the functioning of our societies and economies (including Critical Infrastructures), on public communication networks and off-the-shelf components is an additional risk. However, in the area of cybersecurity, recent developments and trends render traditional (i.e. static and iterative) risk management methodologies ineffective and rapidly obsolete.
There are however no generally accepted best practices guidelines for risk management, nor a consensus on the minimal requirements for the market actors concerned, neither at a sectorial, nor at cross-sector level. For this reason, the NIS* public-private platform (Network Information Security Platform) will seek to identify best practices on risk management, including information assurance, risks metrics and awareness raising.
Scope: The proposals should implement a pilot to demonstrate the viability and scalability of state-of-the-art risk management frameworks. The risk management framework will have to encompass methods to assess and mitigate the risks in real time. Work should include a socio-economic assessment to evaluate the cost-benefit of implementing the framework. The framework should be dynamic, continuously adapted to new ways of managing risk to keep up with the ever evolving threat and vulnerability landscape. New ways of dealing with the security risk resulting from on-demand composition of services and massive interconnectivity should be developed.
The work on risk management frameworks can be complemented with the development of tools to evaluate the risks and its impact on business, tools for preventive assessment of risk and trustworthiness of customers and providers, tools providing a simple view and understanding of a complex system, and tools to detect social engineering attacks. Where necessary risk management can include ICT supply chain security.
Current assurance models and the resulting control and audit frameworks should be revisited. The applicability of the methods to the calculation of insurance premiums should also be investigated.
The selected pilots will have to engage with the NIS platform, contribute to its objectives and take due consideration of its recommendations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m EURO  would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end user alike. Proposals are encouraged to include public security end-users and/or private end users.
Expected impact:
A risk management framework has to be put in place allowing the comprehensive comparison between sector specific or national approaches, and providing an assessment on the residual risk. The framework will facilitate the implementation of legal obligations on risk management, identify gaps in existing legislation, while remaining adaptive to possible changes in the legal frameworks.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In line with technological developments and emerging threats, the improvement of performance and efficiency of cryptographic solutions is a persistent need across ICT.
Scope:
Proposals may address one or more of the areas/challenges described below but not necessarily all of them:
- Functional encryption solutions that offer more flexibility and make it feasible to process encrypted data held on the Internet. Research should aim for solutions beyond the current only partial homomorphic encryption algorithms under development.
Activities should also deal with measurement of information leaked when allowing for flexibility and preserving data formats. Additionally, means to reduce this leakage (e.g., anonymization or obfuscation) should be researched.
- For application areas such as the Internet of Things, implantable medical devices and sensor nodes that harvest energy from the environment there is a need for ultra-lightweight cryptology. Additional means to protect privacy in these applications (e.g. anonymity in communications) should be developed.
Even if Moore’s law would hold for the next 10-15 years, the progress in bandwidth and storage capacity grows faster than the computing power; and so this means that there is a need for ultra-high-speed cryptographic algorithms that are fully parallelizable and energy efficient as well as high speed encryption applied directly to the physical layer, for example using quantum cryptography. This challenge is related to the challenge of ultra-lightweight cryptology but the optimization target is very different and hence completely different designs are expected.
- Implementation (hardware or software) is often the weak point of the strongest cryptographic protocols: physical cryptanalysis, including tampering, side channel, faults injection attacks, has to be taken into account in the early phases of a development. A specific attention should be paid to the security of the implementation and its validation.
While development tools today include support for good software practices that avoid many common implementation errors, these tools insufficiently support good practices that can bring cyber-secure primitives and applications. Therefore, more progress is needed in the development of toolkits that integrate encryption seamless in their toolbox environment.
- Authenticated encrypted token research for mobile payment solutions and related applications. Most currently existing payment solutions emulate a credit or debit card payment scheme. Tokenized payment solutions can effectively reduce the risk of cyber-fraud and open options for alternative payment options to European citizens. The proposals should aim to create a real e-currency without compromising security or opening doors for criminals. Different projects may be envisaged, such as an e-€ wallet that can be held on a mobile and used to pay anywhere anytime combining convenience, flexibility and security without compromising the instrument with (inflated) transaction costs or possible criminal misuses.
- Innovative cryptographic primitives and complementary non-cryptographic privacy-preserving mechanisms to enforce privacy at various levels (e.g. pairing based cryptography).
- New techniques, such as quantum safe cryptography, which are secure from quantum computers and other advances in computing and cryptanalysis.
- Proposals on quantum key distribution addressing challenges such as improved performance (higher bit rates, increased loss and noise resilience), network integration (coexistence on existing infrastructure) and the development of new protocols beyond key distribution. Proposals on quantum key distribution should include experimentation and validation with end-users in realistic and relevant scenarios such as for mobile communication backhauling, optical access networks or data-centre to data-centre communication.
- Automated proof techniques for cryptographic protocols.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 million and EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The outcome of the proposals is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 5; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific challenge:
The implementation of trust eServices in specific applications areas like health, public administration, eCommerce includes the provision of electronic signatures, e-seals, timestamps or certified electronic delivery. The deployment and widespread adoption of these eServices is hampered by the lack of globally interoperable solutions, mutually recognized or compatible trust models and the absence of solid business cases for the reliance on electronic signatures, e-seals, timestamps or certified electronic delivery. In addition, the impossibility of transparently assessing the security assurance and trustworthiness of such eServices, in particularly when coming from third countries makes it difficult for citizens and businesses to confidently rely on them.
Scope:
The objective is to devise demonstrators for the automated comparison and interoperability of electronic trust services covering aspects such as security assurance levels, operational security audits, state supervision systems, data protection regimes or liability of trust service providers. Solutions should rely on state-of-the-art technology, interoperability linking existing electronic identification and authentication systems, taking into account different jurisdictions. Key elements of the initiative will be the differential assessment of technical and organisational standards for trust services, as well as the development of a framework for 'global trust lists'.
Validation platforms able to handle the specificities of various jurisdictional or national systems could be created to provide easy to understand assessments of the trustworthiness of any given trust service.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €8m EURO would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end user alike. Proposals are encouraged to include public security end-users and/or private end users.
Expected impact:
Demonstrate a positive business case and the economic value for the use of and reliance upon trust eServices. By paving the way for global interoperability of trust eServices, the initiative should contribute to empower and protect users in their digital experiences like e-contracting, e-bidding, e-invoicing, accessing social networks, or accessing the services of local or national administrations (e.g. issuing documents like driver's licence, visa, …). The initiative should create the conditions for more commercial applications and services to integrate the use of e-signatures, timestamps, e-seals and certified electronic delivery. Enhancing the trustworthiness of electronic transactions will ease the dematerialisation of processes, reduce administrative overhead for citizens and businesses and, last but not least, facilitate higher availability of eGov services.

Connected and automated driving systems for heavy commercial vehicles have great potential to bring a disruptive change to the trucking industry, fleet operators and the whole logistics sector. They can improve safety and efficiency of freight transport and make vehicle operations more comfortable. Fuel efficiency gains can be achieved through automated truck operations, such as platooning. Various automated trucks and truck platooning concepts are being tested in several countries. Positive impacts can be expected when highly automated systems will be used in logistics operations going from hub to hub including both operations in mixed traffic and in confined areas.
There are a number of specific challenges that need to be addressed before connected, cooperative and automated driving technologies for heavy commercial vehicles can be widely deployed: vehicle technologies, driver/user interaction/collaboration, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, operational challenges in confined areas (ports, logistics terminals, consolidation centres, truck parkings, etc.) and in mixed traffic on public roads.
Scope:
The focus of this topic is to develop, test and demonstrate connected and automated systems for heavy commercial vehicles in real logistics operations.
Proposed actions should include all the following aspects:
Identify logistics operational needs and analyse new, emerging business and operating models and related technologies for efficient, high capacity and safe connected and automated heavy commercial vehicles (preferably low-emission vehicles) and optimised links with other parts in the logistics chain.
Develop, design, test and validate enhanced connected and automated vehicle technologies for heavy commercial vehicles for improved perception and localisation, vehicle control, connectivity (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-cloud and vehicle-infrastructure), system resilience and dependability, functional safety, cyber security, interoperability and system cost optimization, reduced emissions and fuel consumption at fleet level.
Test and demonstrate innovative, efficient and safe connected and automated heavy commercial vehicles for real logistics operations on hub-to-hub corridors, on open roads in mixed traffic or in confined areas addressing mixed traffic capabilities to prepare for operation in real road conditions..
Enhanced interaction between connected and automated heavy commercial vehicles and their users and other (vulnerable) road users. Innovative services for automated freight logistics of individual transport units.
A cost-benefit analysis will demonstrate the added value and economic viability of automated systems in real logistics operations for users and stakeholders.
The active involvement of shippers, freight forwarders and truck manufacturers is strongly encouraged. The cooperation with organisations linked to actions of the TEN-T network is encouraged.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should foresee cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and/or Australia.

Significant progress has been made in developing technologies for connected and automated driving in Europe and many large-scale demonstration projects are already ongoing. Automated driving functions for passenger cars at SAE Level 3[1], such as Traffic Jam Chauffeur or Highway Chauffeur, are expected to be introduced into the market from 2020 onwards.
However, several challenges remain, in particular for highly automated vehicles, before we will see them on the roads. Highly automated vehicles must achieve very high levels of availability and effectiveness of the vehicle functions and their performance has to be better compared to the performance of human drivers. Based on ongoing demonstration pilots, new large scale, cross-border corridor projects for highly automated driving systems are needed to ensure that no new risks are introduced and to study user and customer expectations and acceptance, market potentials and risks.
Scope:
The proposed actions should include all the following aspects:
Demonstrate the robustness and reliability (functional safety) and user acceptance of connected and highly automated driving technologies and systems for passenger cars (SAE level 4[2]) for different use cases in particularly challenging and complex environments that are expected to be introduced into the market after 2020.
Test innovative connectivity technologies for connected and automated driving since communication and cooperation of automated vehicles with other vehicles, infrastructure and other road users has the potential to increase the safety, comfort, productivity and the enabling of innovative business models of automated vehicles and to improve the efficiency of the overall transport system.
The use of the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (Galileo and EGNOS) should be encouraged to achieve the full potential of advanced satellite positioning for automated driving functions.
Optimised use of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data for automation should be considered.
Conduct cross-border demonstrations to ensure that new services and systems are compatible and interoperable at European level, to optimise the use of digital technologies for automation between countries, to coordinate investments towards reliable communication coverage and to exploit the full potential of hybrid communications between short-range and long-range technologies and technologies within the 5.9 GHz spectrum band.
Develop and test solutions for smooth communication and interaction between automated vehicles and their users and other (vulnerable) road users, taking into account gender differences, when relevant.
Holistic concept for cybersecurity to protect automated driving systems (and its connectivity points) to avoid any (conscious) manipulations of the information enabling automated driving functions and to assure confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. This concept should also include the protection of the information collected by the automated vehicles and the external data transferred to the vehicles. Provide support to the development of testing and validation procedures of connected and automated driving functions, including their performance related to cyber-security.
Evaluate effects of connected, cooperative and highly automated driving systems on transport system efficiency, safety, security, environment as well as on user behaviour and user acceptance, taking into account gender differences and other intersectionalities, when relevant.
Lessons learned (data, knowledge and experiences from the project, including disengagements and edge cases) should be provided. Consortia should commit to make the data collected during the pilots available through common data sharing frameworks in order to foster further research.

The automotive industry commits significant efforts and resources to test and validate advanced driver assistance functions. For systems with high levels of automation, the need for testing and validation will drastically increase as a comprehensive range of driving situations and scenarios have to be considered. Current available procedures do not provide an efficient and cost-effective solution. There is a great need for a comprehensive approach to develop common procedures for testing, validation and certification for highly automated driving functions in various traffic scenarios.
Scope:
Research should focus on the development of testing and validation procedures of highly automated driving functions for different use cases in various traffic scenarios, including cross-border travelling. Proposed solutions shall seek broad consensus and agreement among involved stakeholders across the value chain. Therefore, a large participation of stakeholders from industry and Member States is crucial. Data and knowledge gathered from on-going and future pilot tests across Europe should provide a sound scientific basis to define comprehensive validation procedures for highly automated driving. Data obtained by proposed actions should be made available for all manufacturers and stakeholders. Procedures for merging the real-time simulation of driving environments with real tests on complete vehicle or on one or several subsystems in parallel should be researched to reduce testing time and costs, foster the collaboration between different stakeholders and analyse complex interactions in complete sets of tests. Proposals should elaborate common criteria for model-based validation and simulation on vehicle level as well as on vehicle components, and V2X communication systems level. The consideration of new testing procedures and tools for reliable and accurate positioning as well as for cyber-security vulnerability assessment would be an asset.

It will be necessary to catalogue and analyse existing procedures and parameters and to identify gaps and weaknesses and potential synergies. Proposals should look at the possibility of employing new approaches to testing and validation, for example procedures already used successfully in other sectors which could be transferred and adopted to highly automated driving functions. The development of testing and validation procedures should also take into account the needs of type approval.

A major challenge is to produce the novel nano-pharmaceuticals to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) quality, maximising bioavailability and stability and in sufficient quantity for late pre-clinical and clinical testing. To this end the production of the nano-pharmaceuticals needs to be scaled-up from a small laboratory scale in the milligram range to a larger scale. A high level of GMP quality needs to be ensured, for example in terms of particle size and sterility (where appropriate), as required by the regulations for medicines.
Scope:
Open Innovation Test Beds (OITB) should upgrade or develop nano-pharmaceutical materials production facilities and make available to industry and interested parties, including SMEs, services for the design and development of production processes, characterisation and quality control of nano-pharmaceuticals;
The OITB should provide GMP certified batches of nano-pharmaceuticals suitable for late pre-clinical and clinical testing and in accordance with European regulatory requirements for medicines;
The OITB need to provide guidance for late pre-clinical and clinical testing, which itself could be done outside the OITB, benefitting from already existing infrastructures, and/or within the same OITB;
Open access at fair conditions and cost as well as outreach and dissemination across Europe, based on a distinct methodology;
The users / clients of the OITB will typically be SME's and laboratories with innovative proofs-of-concept and IPR for developing novel nano-pharmaceuticals and demonstration of the scalability of the production process of the technology.
Proposals submitted under this topic are encouraged to include actions designed to facilitate cooperation, across Europe, with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Proposals should therefore include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the LEIT Introduction in this Work Programme. In particular, they should demonstrate the likelihood of an additional turnover of at least 4 times the requested EU funding, within 5 years of the end of the grant.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 7 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The OITB should improve the European infrastructure and competence in nano-pharmaceutical process development, characterisation, quality control and pilot production, while taking into account the medical regulatory requirements. Proposals must address all the following impact criteria:
Realise open and upgraded facilities at the EU level for the development, characterisation, quality control and production of nano-pharmaceuticals, easily accessible to users across different regions of Europe;
Improved availability and flexibility of nano-pharmaceuticals supply with GMP quality for late pre-clinical and clinical trials, meeting medical regulatory requirements;
Increase of the attractiveness of Europe as a location-of-choice to carry out advanced medical and nano-pharmaceutical research and product development, due to improved nano-pharmaceuticals supply capacity and availability of a rich eco-system of related suppliers of products and services;
Contribution to demonstrating the effectiveness of nano-pharmaceuticals for medical therapies and / or diagnostic procedures (e.g. medical imaging);
Improvement of user’s knowledge on medical and pharmaceutical regulatory aspects, especially of academics and SMEs;
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

In order to make business decisions, industry requires material model workflows spanning from materials design to materials processing and manufacturing validated in an industrial context, which meet specified technical as well as business requirements (with quantified key performance indicators). An open access materials modelling platform can build and execute such complex workflows chosen by industry based on information provided by e.g. the Open Translator Environment, Business Decision Support Systems and Materials Modelling Market Place[1].
Easily accessible and standardised workflows that are swiftly implemented at the platform would assist in the evaluation of materials and materials processing possibilities.

The aim is to establish an open innovation platform for integrated materials modelling and materials processing development for industry that would facilitate setting up experiments, reduce error and enhance efficiency of the development process.
A modelling framework applicable to a certain type of materials and their related processing technologies should be developed. This modelling framework should develop a seamless and standardised integration of third party physics-based models, solvers, post-processors and databases based on existing and emerging standards for semantic interoperability across domains, resulting in an open framework.
The proposals should also:
Develop apps that can be integrated readily in Business Decision Support Systems and in the Open Translator Environment to assist rapid and efficient decision making;
Develop validation methodologies and benchmarks. In depth success stories including gap-analysis of existing models should drive future concerted research activities and efforts aimed at enhancing existing models;
Provide contributions to the development of a standardised ontology covering modelling, characterisation, materials processing and materials manufacturing;

The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) will federate existing and emerging research data infrastructures, and provide researchers with services for Open Research Data (ORD) storage, management, analysis and re-use across disciplines. The move towards a thematic EOSC section for food and nutrition security (FNS) - or Food Cloud - would accelerate and support the ongoing transition to a more Open Science and Open Innovation model for food and nutrition systems, stimulate intra- and interdisciplinary research, and increase the impact and efficiency of research investments and infrastructures. It would address the increased complexity of data sharing and analysis as well as reproducibility within and across scientific disciplines, as well as the sharp growth in data volumes. Although the components needed to create a first generation Food Cloud are largely there, they are fragmented, spread over EU Member States and across different scientific communities, and lack interoperability. There is a lack of widespread awareness of the value of open research data and of incentives and possibilities for data sharing. There is no dedicated and mandated effort or instrument to co-ordinate EOSC-type activities within the area of FNS research.
Scope:

Proposals shall support a food systems approach to research and innovation for FNS, focus on use cases that can significantly contribute to the priorities defined in the European Commission Staff Working Document FOOD 2030[1] and that address researchers' needs especially in data intensive fields such as microbiome research. The Food Cloud demonstrators will build on progress of relevant projects (e.g. e-ROSA[2], EOSCPilot[3], ENPADASI[4], RICHFIELDS[5]), integrate existing communities, and make use of relevant learnings from parallel thematic initiatives being developed under Horizon 2020 (e.g. Blue Cloud[6]).

","Coordination and support action

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Web technologies and mobile apps have become an essential means to delivering and accessing information and services. With 1 in 4 people in the EU aged 16 or over suffering from a long-term disability [1] and an ageing population, web accessibility has become crucial. Web accessibility means that everyone, including persons with disabilities, will be able to better perceive, understand, navigate and interact with the Internet. Web accessibility thus enables the participation of millions of Europeans that may otherwise be at risk of exclusion from the digital society.
The Web Accessibility Directive [2] establishes accessibility requirements for the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies, which public sector bodies need to start to apply as from the 23 September 2019. The resulting public offer of inclusive digital services and accessible information should give a positive impetus to the private sector to follow suit.
Recent studies [3] show that there is a significant divergence in the practical implementation of accessibility solutions and know-how across Member States. This may give rise to inefficiencies if not addressed with supportive actions.
Scope:
To help harmonise approaches across Member States, to ensure a cost-efficient provision of accessible information and services and to enable the participation of all relevant communities in the Digital Single Market, it is important to support the relevant stakeholder communities (such as Member States, public administrations, service providers, academia and associations representing people with disabilities). This can be done by raising awareness of the current state-of-the-art as regards digital accessibility solutions and to offer opportunities to make use of existing know-how and best practices.
Proposals under this action should set up a 'digital accessibility observatory' with the aim to:
1.take stock of market and technological developments in the area of solutions for digital accessibility. This in order to identify gaps as well as available and affordable solutions and services, for fulfilling the accessibility requirements of the Web Accessibility Directive. People with disabilities may be involved in the identification of these gaps, issues and barriers and in the testing of possible solutions;
2.monitor progress of market development in digital accessibility and the deployment of cost efficient solutions across the EU;
3.create, maintain and update an open and dynamic repository of all the project's findings, such as a digital accessibility platform;
4.provide opportunities for exchange of best practices among Member States and other stakeholders;
5.promote awareness raising, and capacity building.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around 1.5M€ would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will support the implementation of the Web Accessibility Directive. It will support both public administrations as well as other relevant actors, committed to providing accessible information and services, in identifying the most appropriate accessibility solutions. In the long term, it could result in scalable and more affordable solutions. Overall, the actions will contribute to the widespread recognition of the benefits of accessible digital services and information in an increasingly digital society and economy.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
This activity is directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders. It is excluded from the delegation to Research Executive Agency and will be implemented by the Commission services

De Europese Commissie (hierna “de Commissie”) doet via haar Vertegenwoordiging in België een oproep tot het indienen van voorstellen voor de selectie van partners voor het beheer van een EUROPE DIRECT in de periode 2021-2025.
EUROPE DIRECT legt op proactieve en doorlopende basis contact met burgers om te zorgen voor een grotere betrokkenheid bij het Europese project. Door informatie- en betrokkenheidsactiviteiten te organiseren, stelt EUROPE DIRECT de burgers in staat weloverwogen keuzes te maken over de toekomst van de EU door volledig deel te nemen aan het Europese democratische proces.
Door een beter begrip te bevorderen van de manier waarop de EU en haar parlementaire democratie werken en van welke kwesties onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de EU vallen, maakt EUROPE DIRECT de burgers er beter van bewust dat zij dagelijks voordeel halen uit de EU en wijst zo op de toegevoegde waarde van de EU.
EUROPE DIRECT helpt bij het bepalen van de aspecten van het EU-beleid die op lokaal niveau belangrijk zijn en kan boodschappen en activiteiten afstemmen op de lokale behoeften. Via voorlichtings- en betrokkenheidsactiviteiten helpt EUROPE DIRECT de weg te banen voor de strategische beleidsprioriteiten van de Commissie en het Parlement.
EUROPE DIRECT luistert ook naar de verwachtingen van de burgers en kan de EU-instellingen van feedback voorzien.
EUROPE DIRECT werkt nauw samen met de Vertegenwoordigingen van de Commissie en met de liaisonbureaus van het Europees Parlement (hierna “de EPLO’s”) in de respectieve lidstaten. EUROPE DIRECT werkt ook samen met andere EU-outreachnetwerken en lokale contactpunten, waaronder relevante lokale netwerken (indien deze bestaan), en bevordert onderlinge uitwisselingen en samenwerking.
Vijf kerntaken
Taak 1: Informatie voor en betrokkenheid met de burgers
Taak 2: Contacten met lokale media en multipliers
Taak 3: Bewustzijn van gevoelige EU-onderwerpen op lokaal niveau
Taak 4: De EU in scholen

La Commission européenne (ci-après la « Commission »), par l’intermédiaire de sa Représentation en Belgique, lance un appel à propositions afin de sélectionner des partenaires pour la gestion des EUROPE DIRECT pour la période 2021-2025.
Les EUROPE DIRECT nouent un dialogue proactif et continu avec les citoyens afin de renforcer le sentiment d’appartenance envers le projet européen. En organisant des activités d’information et de dialogue, les EUROPE DIRECT permettent aux citoyens de faire des choix éclairés concernant l’avenir de l’UE en participant pleinement au processus démocratique européen.
En favorisant une meilleure compréhension de la manière dont fonctionnent l’UE et sa démocratie parlementaire et des questions qui relèvent de la responsabilité de l’UE, EUROPE DIRECT sensibilise les citoyens aux avantages que leur procure l’UE au quotidien, tout en mettant en évidence sa valeur ajoutée.
EUROPE DIRECT contribue à relever les aspects des politiques de l’UE qui sont importants à l’échelle locale et à adapter les messages et les activités aux besoins locaux. Par des activités de sensibilisation et de dialogue avec les citoyens, EUROPE DIRECT contribue à préparer le terrain pour les priorités politiques stratégiques de la Commission et du Parlement.
EUROPE DIRECT est également à l’écoute des attentes des citoyens et permet un retour d’information aux institutions de l’UE.
Les EUROPE DIRECT travaillent en étroite collaboration avec les Représentations de la Commission et avec les bureaux de liaison du Parlement européen (ci-après les « bureaux de liaison ») dans les États membres respectifs. Ils cherchent également à coopérer avec d’autres réseaux et points de contact locaux de l’UE, y compris des réseaux locaux (lorsqu’ils existent), et promeuvent les échanges et la coordination mutuels.

Punkty EUROPE DIRECT stale i w aktywny sposób komunikują się z obywatelami, aby przyczynić się do zwiększenia poczucia odpowiedzialności za projekt europejski.
Działania informacyjne i służące zaangażowaniu obywateli prowadzone przez punkty EUROPE DIRECT umożliwiają obywatelom podejmowanie świadomych decyzji dotyczących przyszłości UE poprzez zapewnienie im pełnego uczestnictwa w europejskim procesie demokratycznym.

Dzięki rozpowszechnianiu wiedzy na temat sposobu funkcjonowania UE i jej systemu demokracji parlamentarnej oraz wiedzy na temat kwestii, za które UE ponosi odpowiedzialność, punkty EUROPE DIRECT przyczyniają się do zwiększenia świadomości obywateli na temat tego, jakie korzyści wynikające z członkostwa ich państwa w UE czerpią oni w swoim codziennym życiu, oraz podkreślają ich wartość dodaną.

Punkty EUROPE DIRECT ułatwiają zidentyfikowanie tych aspektów związanych ze strategiami UE, które są istotne na szczeblu lokalnym, i mogą pomóc w opracowywaniu komunikatów i działań dostosowanych do lokalnych potrzeb. Prowadzone przez punkty EUROPE DIRECT działania komunikacyjne i działania służące zaangażowaniu obywateli przyczyniają się do przygotowania gruntu pod realizację strategicznych priorytetów politycznych Komisji i Parlamentu.

Punkty EUROPE DIRECT wsłuchują się również w oczekiwania obywateli i zapewniają im możliwość przekazywania informacji zwrotnych instytucjom UE.

Punkty EUROPE DIRECT prowadzą ścisłą współpracę z Przedstawicielstwami Komisji i Biurami Kontaktowymi Parlamentu Europejskiego (zwanymi dalej „EPLO”) w poszczególnych państwach członkowskich. Dążą one również do nawiązania współpracy z innymi sieciami informacyjnymi i punktami kontaktowymi UE, wliczając sieci i punkty lokalne (gdzie takowe funkcjonują), a także wspierają wymianę informacji i koordynację podejmowanych działań.

Driven by the anticipated future threats in the air combat domain, mainly the existence and proliferation of highly integrated and networked air defence systems, fighter aircrafts of fifth generation and the expected limitations in use of the electromagnetic spectrum, the Capability Development Plan (CDP) highlights the need to integrate and “combine manned and unmanned platforms in a larger operational system”.
The development of future air combat systems will be characterized by an information centric networked approach. The next generation of air combat capabilities is envisaged as a combination of manned platforms – both newly developed and enhanced legacy fighter aircraft platforms–, teamed with a variety of unmanned systems, all equipped with a diversity of sensors and/or effectors.
To enable the variety of different assets to operate during an air operation together jointly and synchronized, to share sensor and effector resources, to share information and situational awareness overall leading to information and ultimately decision superiority to achieve the mission, a highly integrated multiplatform mission management capability will be required.
In the context of this call, this multiplatform mission management capability must be understood as the capability to enable a group, composed of several air combat platforms (manned and unmanned) of different types and capabilities, achieving a common mission task or goal. Moreover, such multiplatform mission management capability must be able to coordinate several groups of air combat platforms in time and space.
Current European air combat systems (e.g. Rafale, Eurofighter, Gripen, European MALE RPAS) are foreseen to be embedded as “enhanced legacy platforms” in the future air combat system(s). Concepts for other unmanned air combat platforms (e.g. remote carriers, smart cruise missiles, UCAV (Unmanned combat aerial vehicle)) are under development in several EU Member States. In the context of multiplatform command and control/mission management, concepts and demonstrators (such as manned-unmanned teaming) are also in development.
With regard to integration and combination of air combat platforms in Europe, on the long-term within a future air combat system, on the mid-term by trying to enhance European air combat capabilities by partial combination and integration of existing systems, the challenges are:
EU Member States lack a consolidated perspective of use cases, applications, high level operational and technical requirements with regard to multiplatform management capabilities between air combat platforms, manned and unmanned;
the further development of platform and operating concepts and architectures in national EU Member State silos is prone to hamper interoperability of later on systems and products, causing the need for further investments to harmonize developments at a later stage;
the need for a contemporary initiation of the development of early multiplatform mission management capabilities based on legacy fighter aircraft platforms to enhance European air combat capabilities in the mid-term, by ensuring later on interoperability with future air combat systems.
Scope:
The proposals must address the generation of a consolidated perspective of interested EU Member States and industries with regard to mid- and long-term development of an EU multiplatform management capability for air combat systems, manned and unmanned.
The proposals must consider manned fighter aircraft from EU origin (and potentially connectivity with those from non-EU origin), and unmanned combat platform assets/concepts like “Remote Carriers”, UCAVs and “Smart Cruise Missiles”.
The proposals must consider scenarios for air combat operations in contested and highly contested environments.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study and design, not excluding downstream activities, of an EU multiplatform management capability for manned and unmanned air combat systems.
The targeted activities must in particular include:
the development of potential use cases, scenarios and applications for multiplatform mission management capabilities;
the derivation of high level operational and technical requirements including human factors or artificial intelligence (AI) elements with regard to multiplatform mission management capabilities;
the description of the solutions’ space by selected multiplatform mission management concepts;
the assessment of EU existing technologies with regard to multiplatform mission management and respective technological enablers (e.g. network connectivity);
a gap analysis of technologies to define respective roadmaps and conduct cost risk mitigation evaluation;
the identification of “first” mid-term multiplatform mission management application (i.e. potential “quick-wins” based on “enhanced legacy fighter aircrafts”);
the study, design and implementation of one or several small scale demonstrator(s) and its (their) concept assessment. The output must include:
a dynamic display of selected contemporary technologies and small-scale technological demonstrators, in order to make tacit expert knowledge accessible and conduct a nation-specific exchange;
the assessment of operational, technical and legal boundaries and limitations, and national specifics.
As a modus operandi, the proposed action must ensure the participation of respective ministries of defence’ representatives, including through interviews and workshops.
Main high-level requirements
The proposed capability should at least be based on:
significantly improving mission capability and mission efficiency;
existing and emerging flight safety and airworthiness rules;
mission joint operativity within a fleet of mixed air platforms;
MUM-T key operational aspects (including joint ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition & Reconnaissance) supporting combat);
service oriented architecture principles;
connectivity/interoperability management principles to set up secure, resilient, agile communication infrastructure and architecture and to provide connectivity services;
data distribution management principles;
existing and to be defined open standards and other European initiatives (e.g. ECOA (European Component Oriented Architecture), ESSOR (European Secure Software defined Radio)).
The implemented capabilities should provide enhanced cyber secured interoperability of Member States’ systems involved in air operations (including C2 ground or air assets) and be upgradeable and scalable.
The proposed capability should ensure interoperability with NATO and consider other coalition situations.
Expected Impact:
Generation of a consolidated EU perspective of the subject matter within EU Member States’ ministries of defence and EU industry;
Identification of potential “quick-wins” in the context of multiplatform mission management applications with regard to mid-term enhancements of European air combat capabilities;
Generation of prerequisites and inputs for the long-term development of future air combat systems definition;
Provision of a vehicle for cross-ministries of defence and cross-industry exchange in the subject of multiplatform mission management;
Provision of a potential starting point for developing EU standards to enable further development of interoperable products by EU nations and industry;
Evaluation of increased mission capability, efficiency and force in air combat missions;
Identification of technologies for the mission management capability for enhancement of EU Member States combat capability;
Generation of European technology for multi mission management independent of third countries."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The fast-changing geo-political situation, as well as the evolving operational context, drives future capability needs. In addition to the past decade’s focus on peacekeeping, anti-piracy and patrol operation, navies will also have to operate again in the upper end of the spectrum in terms of threat and intensity, to sail in more remote and extended areas and reduce the need of highly skilled embedded crews. This translates into:
Stronger emphasis on detectability, survivability, perseverance and battle hardening;
Capabilities to sail and operate in more demanding conditions, in particular extreme climates both tropic and arctic;
Worldwide operation and permanent protection of the exploitation of marine resources and sea lines of communication against all kind of threats;
Sea-basing at a large scale;
Increased adaptability to different mission-profiles both in a solo role or as part of a flotilla;
Reduced crew ship operation through autonomy and automation;
Increased operational availability of naval assets;
Emphasis on emission reductions and energy efficiency improvements;
Integration of new weapon systems against new short or long-range threats and targets.
The first challenge in developing a new generation of naval vessels is not the concept itself but the development of technologies that once integrated form the essence of the concept. This requires common feasibility studies to evaluate the state-of-the-art, the potential and the impact of integrating such technologies on a platform and its payload.
With several Member States currently undergoing replacement programmes for their navies, the results of the study should lay ground for the development of recommendations about potential building blocks within the European Defence Fund and/or at national level.
Scope:
To address these challenges, the study should be structured around the investigation of the potential impact of a number of existing as well as future systems and technologies on the performance of a naval platform, in a high-level threat environment (surface and subsurface).
New development are relevant, such as those having a high impact on capabilities to conduct missions and to increase adaptability to different mission-profiles; detectability; survivability against modern threats; ship-motion control; electric power generation and storage; capability to operate in extreme climates; increased autonomy & automation and connectivity to sea port.
The feasibility study should recommend a number of game-changing developments in the framework of EDF, to bring the TRL (Technology Readiness Level) and SRL (System Readiness Level) level of the block to its maximum.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover a study over a period of maximum 30 months.
Main high-level requirements:
Based on the CDP recommendation, the feasibility study shall address the following issues:
1. Lower detectability
The level at which a naval platform is detectable by adversaries is a major consideration when confronted by those adversaries.
The study shall address to what extent ship signatures can be further reduced or augmented compared to today’s levels and/or camouflaged in order both to minimize detectability and improve effectiveness of own sensors and soft kill measures. Signature management in off-design conditions shall be addressed too.
Solutions to make the vessel invisible for radar (RCS (Radar Cross Section)), to mitigate the effect of the earth magnetic field, radiated noise, infrared and other energy sources shall be studied as well as measures to improve the stealth capability against interrogating acoustic, electromagnetic and hydrodynamic sensor systems. Solutions for signature modelling shall be studied as well.
2. Higher survivability against modern surface and subsurface threats including against high-speed threats and swarming threats
Ultimately, the cheapest way to strengthen our defence is to prolong the use and survivability of a naval weapon-system in a confrontation. A focus on technologies also applicable for on service ships will be specifically considered
The study shall look into solutions for:
Improved redundancy, protection and damage containment;
Blast and shock tolerant structures;
Capability to recover lost fighting / sailing / floating capabilities (reconfiguration, self-mending / healing systems);
New advanced and light weight armoured materials (active armouring, ceramic armouring, protection against RPG7-like anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher, in particular for bridge protection);
Innovative lay-outs;
The study shall also take into account the latest developments in future weapon systems and sensors including the effect it will have on the development of the platform solutions.
3. Reduction of ship motions
Operations with helicopters, UAV/USV (Unmanned Air Vehicle/Unmanned Surface vehicle) and UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) systems are limited to a window set by ship motions. Solutions are multi-faceted and offer a lot of potential improvements.
New developments offer new opportunities to control ship motion in all direction and thus extend the use of the above-mentioned systems. The following developments shall be addressed:
Naval architecture: identify architecture options for hull shapes and appendages, allowing gains in sea keeping and minimizing vertical accelerations;
Improvement of stabilization: new stabilization modes (mobile mass, active foils...);
Operation in higher sea states;
Use of prediction: measuring and calculating waves in advance and evaluating their impact, motion sensors;
Interactions with other systems: UxS (Unmanned Systems), aircraft, small vessels;
Human factors: improve crew working condition to operate the ship (aided system for environment perception like artificial horizon, systems reducing impact of motion, etc.).
The study shall investigate the potential of these (combined) developments for frigate sized platforms and formulate required further steps.
4. Improved electric power generation and storage
Innovative solutions to cater for a new generation of energy-demanding weapons such as laser and electro-magnetic guns, as well as to comply with the requirements of environmental legislation, will be necessary.
The study shall look into the potential of energy efficiency improvements, and their impacts and integration challenges of the use and development of alternative fuels, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, sustainable sources, LED (Light-Emitting Diode) sources smart electric power distribution: ""NAVAL GRID"" (modelling – simulation), new power to thrust conversion systems and new materials / improved yields.
5. Capability to operate in extreme climates
Taking into account the changing political importance of remote geographical areas as well as the effects caused by climate change in terms of more extreme weather conditions and the access to so far closed-off areas (artic, ant-artic) future naval systems design will face additional requirements such as:
Ice strengthening;
More stringent requirements for on-board platform systems : air-conditioning, lower operating temperatures, etc.;
Insulation.
6. Topside
The purpose is to study topside technologies in order to cover permanently around 360° and to use simultaneously all integrated sensors and radiating effectors. The main topics are:
Analyse and evaluate innovative antenna technologies (meta materials, ferro fluid, plasma…);
Identify and evaluate design and validation EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) tools for integrated topside;
Feasibility study for topside functional and physical integration (interface standardization);
Analyse the feasibility of topside functional ship wall.
7. Increased autonomy and automation
To enable further crew reduction and autonomy at system level, the study shall also address the technologies and systems relevant to damage control, firefighting, replenishment at sea, close proximity manoeuvres.
Expected Impact:
The feasibility study results shall:
Set up a common definition to identify future naval systems and technologies;
Define the state-of-the-art of the identified naval systems and technologies;
Deliver an analysis of the potential improvements, impacts and related cost of their integration into a surface or subsurface platform;
Develop concrete requirement to enable further development and their successful integration on-board future naval platforms;
Elaborate concrete recommendation and proposals for further development programmes, within the EU or national frameworks."

Surveillance of maritime zones, land borders or critical assets is key for European operations. Various solutions are currently used to perform the surveillance of maritime zones, land borders or critical assets, but no proper solution has been found at this time:
Current observation satellites provide daily revisit frequency, upcoming constellations of small satellites will certainly propose a revisit time within the hour. However, this will still be too high to properly understand the behaviour of a terrestrial target, and to track it;
Large Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) can provide permanence over an area but with a limited duration and a very high cost. No predictable near-future evolution is anticipated.
Recent advances in technology developments pushed by industry initiatives can be a solution to this issue. Since the 90’s, international initiatives have been devoted to the application potentialities of the High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS). With respect to terrestrial and satellite networks, technical advantages provided by HAPS are many, among which:
Better propagation conditions for connectivity, lower latency, better image resolution;
Ability to remain continuously and persistently on an area for a long period.
HAPS, operating in the stratosphere, can provide an efficient solution to European defence forces, featuring simultaneously a capacity of permanence and endurance over a large area. HAPS can complement the terrestrial and satellite systems for the surveillance and monitoring services, e.g. keeping a stationary position (at a first approximation) with respect to the ground and thus acting like a fixed observation platform. They can be used to cover environmental “hotspots” providing almost continuous observations, with high spatial resolution, low costs and long duration, equipped with on-board visible, infrared, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensors. They can also be equipped to receive AIS (Automatic Identification System) data and be used as relay for coast-ship communications, as well as broadband communication media for RPAS.
Main HAPS applications are:
Surveillance missions, using radar, optical and Signal intelligence sensors;
Accurate urban surveillance missions, especially in situations that require detailed mapping of impact on high value assets or frequent revisits;
Telecommunication missions, embarking a powerful telecommunication relay.
The development of HAPS solutions necessitates solving specific technological, industrial and operational challenges:
Maturity of the key technologies required to develop such platforms;
Adaptation of the sensors and payloads to the stratosphere environment and high altitude position;
Self-protection of the platform (and ground stations) to the electromagnetic/cyber threats;
Industrial capacity and means to manufacture and integrate such large vehicles;
Simple and autonomous command/control for low cost flight operations;
Real time processing of the very large data flow, to derive actionable information for location based intelligence purposes, exploiting innovative artificial intelligence techniques and fusing data provided by HAPS with other multi-source and heterogeneous earth observation satellites and non earth observation data;
Development of the concept of operation of such innovative assets, with specific operational capacities, together with operational and environmental constraints.
Scope:
The proposed action should contribute to design, develop, manufacture and validate a HAPS solution and as such make a substantial contribution to European defence and security applications.
Benefiting from improvements in composite materials, low-power computing, battery technology and solar panels technologies, HAPS development projects lead by industry have recently reached more advanced stages of development, in particular in Europe.
The proposals will include:
Definition of the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) of HAPS solutions in their various missions, taking into account their specific operational capacities, together with operational and environmental constraints. Such CONOPS will be used to derive the scenarios to be executed by the demonstrator to demonstrate operational capacities for the European forces;
Study of the current and foreseen technology status and identification of the road maps for each product involved. A definition of the demonstrator vehicle and mission chains should then be derived from such road maps;
Design, development, qualification, manufacturing and industrialization of the HAPS platform demonstrator (including command/control ground segment);
Design, development, qualification and manufacturing/procurement of the missions chains, its ground segment and payloads used for the demonstration, derived from existing products used on other systems;
Design and development of HAPS mission data value added exploitation platform and service architecture according to the defined CONOPS;
Design of maintenance program and logistic support;
Certification activities;
Execution of operational scenarios to validate the CONOPS and demonstrate the operational capabilities for the benefit of the European forces definition of future applications and services.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover the initial phases of the development of the platform and associated surveillance mission systems including in particular:
Feasibility study, CONOPS definition, system specification, Detailed Requirements Review (DRR) and architecture definition;
Detailed design of the system, including the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and finishing with the Critical Design Review (CDR).
The proposals shall also include the development of technological demonstrators, in order to support decision making during the design phase.
A detailed planning of the subsequent development phases shall be generated, including the identification of implementation priorities, according to operational needs of the Union and Member States. Subsequent phases up to operational readiness shall include in particular prototype development, qualification and test activities, following a spiral approach, to reach incremental operational capabilities.
Main high-level requirements:
Defence forces are looking for:
High altitude of operation (typically 20 000 m);
Permanence, necessary to detect critical threats;
Endurance with an objective to stay in flight for one year. Ability to support operations without limitation during all its duration shall be investigated;
No ground logistical impact on the operational theatre;
A large payload capacity of several hundred kilograms and several thousand watts, that can embark large scope and long range sensors, such as powerful radars, optical or signal intelligence sensors, necessary for surveillance missions (terrestrial or maritime);

Large radar coverage using a powerful radar;
Powerful optical (visible and infrared and/or hyperspectral) instrument;
Signal intelligence sensors.
Applications for maritime and land (border) surveillance (air and sea);
Applications for monitoring of migratory routes and flows in transit countries or at the EU external border;
Applications for communication and electronic intelligence;

Telecommunication applications, embarking a powerful telecommunication relay (as an option);
Capacity to embark diverse payloads and sensors, according to the mission and to the user requirements, thanks to a modular design and a standardized interface (“plug and play”). Each Member State can define its own payload, based on its own sensors. This capacity will be demonstrated by swapping payloads for diverse purposes and diverse origins;
Ability to work as GNSS-pseudolite (Global Navigation Satellite System) shall be investigated;
Ability to transfer imagery to reach back centres like processing, exploitation and dissemination cells, potentially with the help of artificial intelligence shall be investigated;
Ability to be easily integrated in C2 systems;
Electromagnetic and cyber resilient platform and payloads.
Expected Impact:
Support of European critical defence and security solutions, through the development of innovative solutions in the domain of HAPS;
Ensure secure and autonomous availability of high performance and trustable (re)configurable solution to military end-users;
Contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of the Union industry and help improve its global position through the development of innovative technologies along a new European manufacturing value chain;
Improve competitiveness of the European industry in and beyond the defence and security sector."

The role of Earth observation (EO) and geo information within defence, security and intelligence operations is increasing both from a strategic and tactical point of view. High resolution EO data are undergoing an explosive growth, increasing complexity, like the diversity and higher dimensionality characteristic of the data. EO data are regarded as “big data” and their management requires techniques to solve data-intensive problems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is key to cope with this challenge.
The huge amount of available data sources requires new methodologies to assist the intelligence community streamline their processing and exploitation. The Activity Based Intelligence (ABI) complements the geo spatial activities by rapidly integrating data from multiple sources to discover relevant patterns, determine and identify changes, and characterize those patterns to drive collection and create decision advantage.
The challenge is to define and test a prototype of a system that implements the concept of ABI which is able, in particular, to:
Extract entities (e.g. events, changes, features) from different data sources in an automated way;
Derive insights from the aggregation, correlation and monitoring of such entities in terms of patterns and anomalies.
The challenge is then to provide the ABI system as a new means for ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) to fulfil the command and control needs. This would be achieved by providing tools to analyse in an interactive way the ABI information linked to contextual intelligence information.
Scope:
The already introduced ABI represents a new analysis methodology focused on the “time dimension” and aimed at discovering relevant patterns, detecting and characterising changes, analysing a target’s behaviour and highlighting anomalies. Detected patterns feed a never-ending observation cycle by driving new collections and generating decision advantage.
Consequently, AI has evolved dramatically over the last years especially with the emergence of deep learning techniques. These techniques rely on the traditional neural network approach and, by exploiting hardware evolution (graphics processing unit availability and cloud), are able to reach unmatched accuracies in the traditional machine learning tasks, such as classification, detection, segmentation, etc. Deep learning is applicable to all the different data analysis needs of ABI, relevant to both EO data (Very High Resolution satellites (VHR), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, constellation of micro-satellites, etc.) and un-conventional data sources (social network data, news feeds data, etc.).
The scope of this new system is to support the automated information extraction by applying AI techniques whenever possible and in particular for the extraction of entities such as:
Events, extracted from news feeds and social networks using natural language processing and image analysis with deep learning techniques;
Changes and features from satellite imagery “time series” using deep learning techniques such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
After the extraction of information from heterogeneous sources, ABI includes the ability to aggregate entities and fuse them using spatio-temporal analysis (e.g. density maps of events over time) in order to create insights on different phenomena.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover the development of a prototype that implements the concepts of ABI and that includes in particular:
Analysis of automated methods for entity extraction from EO and non-EO data;
Design of the prototype system including the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and the Critical Design Review (CDR);
Development and demonstration of the prototype.
Main high-level requirements:
The proposals shall fulfil the following general requirements:
State-of-the-art for automated multi-SAR/optical and multi-platform data interpretation focused on time series analysis for ABI;
Analysis of existing satellite missions to be exploited and fused for ABI tasks and definition of mission requirements to fill gaps in data availability;
Support to the geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) analyst in the definition of the most suitable satellite and non-satellite data planning and data collection strategy to carry out ABI tasks. As an example, regarding the different sensor types, it is important to underline that:
SAR missions offer a primary source of information thanks to their reliability (no clouds or atmospheric effects), geo-location accuracy and capability to detect changes;
VHR optical missions and, above all, new missions based on constellations, offer the capability to classify and recognize targets with unprecedented revisit time;
MWIR (Medium Wave Infrared), TIR (Thermal Infrared) future missions are able to detect parameters such as heat as an indicator of activity over specific targets.
Exploitation of innovative AI tools and methodologies (machine learning/deep learning) to support the extraction of relevant information and behaviour from large quantities of unstructured data;
Extraction of motion information as a powerful activity indicator and for pattern-of-life analysis by exploiting:
The capabilities of SAR sensors to highlight moving targets and therefore provide information about “instantaneous activity” over a target area;
The capabilities of new missions to provide high definition videos, taken from space, lasting tens of seconds.
Implementation of functionalities for entity extraction applicable to EO data based on deep learning techniques in order to detect changes and recognize entities;
Implementation of functionalities for entity extraction applicable to non-EO data to overcome the limitation of data sources like social network and news feeds (e.g. data bias, geo-referencing, multi-language);
Integration of multiple sources of information to derive insights, including remote sensing (satellite and airborne), local sensors and open source information such as social network data, properly organized, interpreted and analysed;
Specification and implementation of unconventional data analysis methods on existing data. An example is the use of SAR images to detect and characterise signal from ground-based radars or other electromagnetic devices (interference analysis);
Use of large-scale (both space and time wise) data filtering and analysis in order to develop an understanding by correlating heterogeneous data sets;
Provision of specific workflow for ABI tasks for maritime and land application in order to support the GEOINT analysts work;
Development of the system in a modular and expandable way to incorporate new data streams, new analysis methodologies and operational procedures.
Expected Impact:
Enable the application of ABI for large scale, highly automated analysis of multi-source EO (including high revisit and/or high resolution constellations) and non-EO data;
Use innovative and scalable methodologies to discover location based behaviours and activities relevant for intelligence purposes, taking advantage of the recent technological developments in EO, AI and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) infrastructures for big data management;
Enhance the European industry’s capabilities and competiveness to provide operational ABI services exploiting state-of-the-art EO and non-EO data, platforms and methodologies;
Foster the debate inside the user community about the requirements and challenges of ABI approach for GEOINT applications including, but not limited to, data sources availability and accessibility, data management tools, analysis methodologies, information confidentiality;
Establish a proof-of-concept or a prototype, which can act as reference for the independent user assessment, in light of product extensions and service improvements and for the further technological developments;
Provide tools and best practices for the operational application of ABI principles within the intelligence user community;
Reduce operator workload for data preparation and information extraction in order to concentrate effort on GEOINT contextual analysis;
Improve reaction time for decision making by leveraging continuous data streaming analysis;
Implement information superiority."

In Europe, the lack of different airborne ISR capabilities is assessed as critical. The 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) underlines the permanence of the need for tracking of ships, aircraft and other equipment through a continuous air-space wide-area via interoperable unmanned surveillance system able to operate in all weather conditions and all types of environment (including denied) and with assured data integrity. Tactical RPAS systems and sensors are a key element to information collection and the timely delivery of the information obtained for use in the production of intelligence and situational awareness.
Additionally, the 2018 CDP long-term analysis indicates that Member States of the Union need the ability to create and use a real-time common operational picture, through the fusion of various types of intelligence, as a collaborative planning and task-execution tool on all unit levels, thus enhancing operational effectiveness through a unified information exchange system. The interoperability of unmanned systems (including tactical RPAS), in terms of both Command and Control (C2) data and ISR product exchange is a key enabler towards that direction.
Finally, future long-term capability requirements are projected to include systems with evolving levels of autonomy in order to improve swarming of unmanned systems in air, land or maritime domains and, among other tasks, assist in the gathering of intelligence.
Scope:
Proposals shall address feasibility, detailed design and prototyping of a tactical RPAS system, capable of performing ISR missions, which includes the aircraft, ground control station and ISR product library. Several key aspects of the system need to be addressed in the proposals:
Interoperability in terms of both C2 and ISR product exchange in near real time, always depending on the availability of a suitable communication infrastructure, since this approach will allow intelligence fusion with additional sources towards the creation of a useful Common Operational Picture (COP);
Support for multiple versatile sensor payload configurations and suitable on-board processing capable of extracting useful information from the captured data so that a useful COP can be provided to tactical personnel in near real time;
Low observability and/or other cost effective self-protection measures, which can maximize the survivability of the tactical RPAS system;
Support for multiple, independent communication systems used in various configurations (redundant, parallel, roaming);
Autonomy and swarming capabilities to improve ISR operations while maximizing the survivability of the tactical RPAS system.

The proposals shall cover the initial phases of the development of the tactical RPAS including in particular:
Feasibility study: concept of operations (CONOPS) definition, system specification, Detailed Requirements Review (DRR) and architecture definition;
Detailed design of the system, including the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and finishing with the Critical Design Review (CDR);
Development of a tactical RPAS system prototype.
The proposals shall also include any partial tests in order to support decision making during the design phase and reduce the development risks.
A detailed planning of the subsequent development phases shall be generated, including the identification of implementation priorities, according to operational needs of the Union and Member States. Subsequent phases up to operational readiness shall include prototype development.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) indicates that ensuring an effective and safe access to the airspace, notably in a Single European Sky context for existing and future manned and unmanned air capabilities in order to train for, and conduct, security and defence missions in peacetime, crisis and conflict is a priority in particular to facilitate the integration of military RPAS in non-segregated airspace.
This topic aims at the design and validation of a 100% European Detect And Avoid (DAA) solution for safe insertion of large military Remotely-Piloted Air Systems (RPAS) in the European air traffic with an objective of standardisation, interoperability and certification.
While unmanned air systems (RPAS) have been used to support military missions since long, these assets are still limited to operate in segregated airspace. Current operations require special provisions that severely limit the use of these assets, in particular in dense European airspace. To overcome these limitations, RPAS need to be able to integrate into non-segregated airspace, safely flying along with manned aircraft, interoperable with both military and civil Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, including interaction with Air Traffic Control (ATC) where required. This capability, often referred to as Air Traffic Insertion (ATI), is a key enabler to allow significant expansion of RPAS operations. It is particularly useful for large RPAS (MALE (Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance) and tactical categories) which have range and endurance performances allowing them to address a large scope of missions, including flight operations in civil airspace in Europe.
The absence of a pilot on board means that technological and procedural enablers have to be put in place to allow RPAS operating like any other airspace user. This capability, referred to as Detect And Avoid (DAA), ensures that the RPAS will be able to safely handle collision hazards with any other air vehicles in the sky. For that purpose, it relies on a combination of sensors for traffic detection, and algorithms for collision risk assessment and avoidance manoeuvre. It also provides the remote pilot with a required view of the traffic, Situation Awareness (SA), in order to keep the RPAS away from collision hazard by the appropriate separation minima (remain well clear).
European cooperation (particularly the MIDCAS (Mid Air Collision Avoidance System) project) has already addressed the definition of a DAA solution and the flight evaluation of a proof-of-concept demonstrator. Furthermore, the MIDCAS Standardisation Support Phase (MIDCAS SSP) is well into standardisation of DAA by working actively in the EUROCAE (EURopean Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment) Working Group-105 development of required standards (OSED (Operational Services and Environment Definitions), MASPS (Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards) and MOPS (Minimum Operational Performance Standards)) for DAA. However major efforts remain to be made to reach higher maturity levels and to design an integrated and certifiable solution. The proposals will address the main remaining technical challenges (gaps) of DAA through two main streams of effort:
Qualify the overall performance of a DAA solution and its compliance with safety objectives, for operations in both A-C airspace classes (cooperative traffic) and D-G airspace classes (cooperative and non-cooperative traffic);
Increase the technological maturity level of non-cooperative sensors (visible, infrared and radar) up to TRL 6 through Size Weight & Power (SWAP) optimization and improvement of data processing.
Scope:
Proposals shall address the development and validation of a 100% European DAA solution, which does not contain technology subject to control or restriction by a third country or by a third-country entity (in particular free of any control regime by third countries), able to operate worldwide, in all airspace classes, compliant with applicable regulation & standards, adaptable to a variety of RPAS/drones platforms (MALE, fixed-wing tactical RPAS, vertical take-off and landing RPAS), leveraging on available European background. The proposals should also cover the activities needed to increase the maturity level of non-cooperative sensors (i.e. visible, infrared and radar) through SWAP optimisation and improved robustness of data processing.
The proposals will address two main applications:
IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) flight operations insertion of RPAS in controlled airspace (A to C) with an initial emphasis on MALE;
IFR flight operations in uncontrolled airspace classes (D to G) for application to large tactical RPAS.
With the above, the proposals shall provide operational capability supporting initial (IOC) integration of RPAS in the European (A-C) airspace using cooperative DAA, as well as taking necessary steps towards full integration in all airspace classes (A-G).
These activities will be fully aligned with the RPAS 1 and RPAS 2 steps of the EU RPAS roadmap as well as the SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) European ATM master plan.
The proposals shall foresee a maximum reuse of building blocks and technologies already developed under European cooperation.
The proposals should also fully support the ongoing standardisation and regulatory work within EUROCAE WG-105, EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency), JARUS (Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems) and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), as well as SESAR2020 and other relevant European programs (including EDA (European Defence Agency)-coordination DAA programs MIDCAS and MIDCAS-SSP).
The proposals should not address the insertion of small drones in the so-called U-Space and the operations in Very-Low Level airspace (VLL) but should consider the interoperability with U-space.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover the necessary activities for the design, and where required prototyping, testing and qualification, of a European DAA solution applicable to military RPAS and to various types of platforms (MALE, fixed-wing tactical and vertical take-off and landing RPAS).
The proposals shall cover at least the design activities (and possibly upstream and downstream activities) from the following overall programme of work:
Design improvements of the detect function: sensors miniaturization (SWAP), robustness of sensor processing and fusion algorithms, adaptation to European platforms and related concept of operations;
Design, prototyping and extensive testing of two DAA solutions:
For operations in A-C airspace classes (cooperative);
For operations in D-G airspace classes (non-cooperative).
Design, testing and qualification (through extensive simulation) of a Collision Avoidance (CA) function according to European reference scenarios;
Formal validation of safety case through extensive qualifying simulation programme using reference scenarios, models and conditions provided by Eurocontrol or Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), completed by flight tests;
Design and testing of a Remain Well Clear (RWC) function;
Implementation and flight testing of a TRL 6/7 demonstrator.
The proposals shall cover a view of the complete programme of work up to the operational system with a detailed description of the remaining work to be performed.
Main high-level requirements:
The system shall fulfil the following general requirements:
Support safe integration of RPAS into controlled and uncontrolled airspaces, by assuring SA, RWC and CA functionalities with the applicable target level of safety for both cooperative and non-cooperative traffic;
Enable RPAS operating IFR and Beyond Radio Line-of-Sight (BRLOS) with all capabilities needed for operation in all airspace classes;
Embed cooperative (e.g. ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast) receiver or Bearing-less Active Surveillance (BLAS)) and non-cooperative sensors (visible, infrared and radar);
Embed miniaturized non-cooperative sensors (visible, infrared and radar) allowing their integration in tactical RPAS. The sensors shall be compatible or compliant with draft MOPS RADAR (RTCA (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) and EUROCAE) and draft MOPS EO/IR (Electro-optical/Infrared) (RTCA and EUROCAE);
Embed automatic traffic detection using a combination of cooperative and non-cooperative sensors;
Support integration of external systems data/information on fixed obstacles, weather hazards and no-fly zones;
Be able to fulfil civil and military requirements for different categories of RPAS with initial focus on MALE and tactical systems;
Be integrable (minimizing the customization process) in different categories of RPAS with initial emphasis on MALE and tactical UAS (Unmanned Air Systems) (fixed-wing and vertical take-off and landing RPAS);
Be in line with evolving European standards and regulatory framework as well as the future European ATM, as defined by SESAR;
Comply with European R&D activities on RPAS Integration, i.e. SESAR OSED/SPR (Safety and Performance Requirements)/INTEROP documents on RPAS IFR integration (SESAR2020 PJ10.05 and Wave 2 developments when available);
Comply with EUROCAE DAA OSED and draft DAA MASPS standards;
Comply with risk-ratio defined in the DAA performance metrics defined by ICAO;
Be interoperable with existing and future collision avoidance systems (TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System), ACAS (Airborne Collision Avoidance System)-X, ACAS-Xu), by meeting interoperability standards for CA;
Perform its intended functions in en-route and TMA (Terminal Control Area) phases at any height above ground (take-off, landing and ground operations are not considered);
Have system performances validated with European air traffic models and parameters.
Pure ground based DAA system is not considered feasible for long term evolution of the functionality, and therefore not recommended.
Expected Impact:
Operational impact:
Provide military users with a flexible and safe use of RPAS everywhere, in all airspace classes and anytime;
Allow extension of military RPAS operations in European airspace for training purpose and security missions (border/maritime surveillance, law enforcement, homeland security, protection of major events…).
Strategic impact and operational sovereignty:
To contribute to the Union strategic autonomy in particular through independence to operate military RPAS in worldwide operation;
Ensure the DAA solution does not contain technology subject to control or restriction by a third country or by a third-country entity, directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediate undertakings.
Industrial impact: ensure European industrial capability and competiveness in a key technology area for RPAS/UAS and autonomous systems (military and civil);
Programmatic impact:

EU requirements for increased maritime surveillance calls for a capability to detect and track stealth targets and targets difficult to be detected by conventional radars, without running a risk of being detected and jammed. In this regard, the solution of passive bistatic/multistatic radars is considered as a promising alternative.
Additionally maritime surveillance should take into account archipelago, harbours and coastal urban areas, the surveillance of which requires the deployment of a dense network of sensors. Passive radars are by nature of lower cost because they do not include high power transmitters and the associated modules (i.e. high voltage power supplies, cooling circuits, etc.). Therefore, it is possible to comply with the above mentioned requirement by using a large number of passive radars which will exploit existing RF transmissions (transmitters of opportunity).
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of a passive, highly performant, resilient, reconfigurable and deployable radar system, with respect to multiple defence application scenarios and diverse target specificities.
The proposals must address at least the following points:
detection of sea and air targets at all altitudes. Current commercial solutions respond only to lower tier targets;
efficiency assessment of candidate transmitters of opportunities;
capability to fuse detected cues using different type of illuminators;
demonstration of the capability of operation in network (multiple sensors exploiting one common or multiple transmitters of opportunity);
where possible, use of COTS technologies currently available from European supply chains;
development of SDR (Software design radio) modules tailored for PCL (Passive coherent location) technology;
assessment of innovative antenna configurations;
reconfigurable technologies to achieve long term adaptability and application migration.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study, design, prototyping and testing of the proposed solution, not excluding downstream activities.
The targeted activities must in particular include:
feasibility study, CONOPS definition, technology/system specification, detailed requirements review (DRR); analysis of possible extensive cognitive capabilities.

development of small-scale technological demonstrators, in order to support decision making during the design phase of the final prototype;
development, testing and validation of the final prototype system;
A detailed planning of subsequent project phases must also be generated, including the identification of implementation priorities according to operational needs of the EU and its Member States.
Main high-level requirements
The proposed system should fulfil the following requirements:
detect sea and air targets at all altitudes, including RPAS and low observable targets;
measure target’s bearing, distance and speed;
assistance to the point / areal air defence of navy units and coastal infrastructure;
provide limited cognitive capabilities (i.e. eliminating clutter and multipath);
improved CFAR (Constant false alarm rate) responses within a multistatic network for the detection of low observable / low RCS (Radar cross section) targets;

Expected Impact:
Develop critical technology enablers for counter low observable air and sea targets including RPASs and aircraft flying hidden by geographical profile;
Reinforce interoperability between EU Member States’ armed forces and reinforce cross force protection;
Improve maritime situational awareness for the security of the EU and its Member States;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Consumers should be considered at the heart of the energy system and become active market players. The future private consumer should be more aware, active, energy sufficient, as well as being a prosumer producing energy for their own consumption, where this is possible. Furthermore, in view of the fluctuation in energy prices, consumers are spending an increasing share of their income on energy, with estimates stating that more than 50 million Europeans are affected by energy poverty[1]. Energy efficiency, energy savings and increased use of locally produced, including own produced, renewable energy are key tools in addressing fuel poverty.
In this context, engagement actions are needed across Europe in order to achieve behavioural change towards more sustainable choices and decisions for energy. This includes increasing and understanding consumer 'apetite' for higher efficiency products.
Although awareness on the benefits of collective consumer action in the field of EE and RES has increased in past years, such action is still hampered by a number of barriers, including financial and regulatory barriers and inconsistencies in grid integration practice. In addition, insufficient use of relevant ICT solutions and insufficient understanding of energy bills contribute to hampering the achievement of a more sustainable energy system.
Scope:
Develop and roll out tailored and effective and innovative engagement actions to motivate changes in consumers' sustainable energy behaviour that would result in reduced energy consumption in buildings, heating/cooling systems and/or appliances. The proposed actions should focus on clearly defined target groups of private consumers (individuals or collectives), using market segmentation[2]. The proposed actions should demonstrate an understanding of different types of behaviours and consider the different approaches needed to influence them. The actions should also address the risk of ""rebound effects"", propose measures to counteract them, and apply current theory and practice on consumer decision making processes (e.g. effects of new technologies on energy behaviour). All relevant stakeholders necessary for the successful implementation of the action should be involved and it is expected that relevant consumer organisations, in particular, are either directly involved or their support is clearly demonstrated in the proposal. Where relevant for the proposed action, gender issues should be taken into account, in particular the role gender characteristics may play in influencing consumer behaviour. Actions should preferably cover a wide geographic area through complementary actions covering various parts of the EU. In addition the proposed actions, when relevant, should include policy lessons from the action to contribute to policy development.
The proposed action should cover one or more of the following:
Empower and facilitate actions for consumers to become prosumers, or to form collective consumer groups/consumer cooperatives (addressing energy efficiency and/or renewable energy, and energy storage, where applicable, with a focus on action).
Support clearly defined groups of vulnerable consumers in tackling fuel poverty by facilitating more sustainable energy behaviour and choices in their everyday life, without compromising comfort levels. This should also aim at achieving structural changes of national policies to specifically address fuel poverty and could include the transfer of best practices for the active engagement of vulnerable consumers.
Facilitate wider deployment and consumer adoption of existing ICT-based solutions, for energy efficiency and information on energy consumption and costs, with a focus on action and resulting in improved understanding of ICT interfaces and information depiction (including smart metering and related systems).
Facilitate consumer understanding of energy bills (on and off line), leading to actions allowing for a reduction in energy consumption. Such actions should ensure robust monitoring to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed,
Create better instruments for improving consumer understanding and routing purchase decisions towards higher efficiency products, without compromising comfort levels, and with no additional relevant environmental impacts,
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below (wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets), depending on the scope of the proposal:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project within its duration (in GWh/year per million Euro of EU funding);
Number of people changing their behaviour and taking informed decisions, documenting why and how changes are an effect of particular measures taken, as well in terms of the sustainability of the behavioural change;
Number of consumers engaged by actions aiming at improving consumer understanding and routing purchase decisions towards higher efficiency products;
Renewable Energy production and Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project within its duration (for actions on prosumers/consumers groups, respectively in GWh/year and million Euro of investments per million Euro of EU funding);
Policies and strategies created/adapted to include fuel poverty (for actions on fuel poverty), to be measured in number of citations / statements from governance bodies.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Gender
[1]EESC (2013/C/341/05) referring to the European Fuel Poverty and Energy Efficiency project, 2009
[2]Market segmentation: this involves dividing a bigger target group into subgroups of consumers with common needs and priorities, and developing and implementing specific actions to target them. As an example, vulnerable consumers may be considered too wide a target group and further segmentation would be expected."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The control, automation and monitoring tools that can be integrated into buildings are becoming more and more sophisticated. In order to guarantee energy efficient operation, building service systems need to deliver adequate control and monitoring of building energy parameters. It is essential to develop and demonstrate interoperable energy automation, control and monitoring tools for efficient heating, domestic hot water, ventilation, cooling, lighting, shading, storage, energy generation, and other building systems while ensuring a high quality indoor environment. This includes the investigation of demand response and energy management of individual customers as well.
The challenge is to integrate demand response enabling elements into Energy Management Systems and thus create 'building – energy system interaction' towards optimising, at building level, energy consumption, production and storage considering the availability and price of energy supplied via the grid. A specific challenge is that Energy Management Systems and smart home devices are often not interoperable but are linked to a certain brand, technology and/or standard. Therefore full interoperability between grids, systems and products for seamless integration of all required components in building energy management systems is crucial.
Scope:
At the building and building unit level (residential or non-residential) the focus should be on optimisation, integration and demonstration of cost effective and interoperable solutions, including testing of new technologies and systems in real life situations.
The proposed solutions shall be demonstrated for buildings which incorporate intelligent Energy Management Systems and new technologies (smart home devices). They should ensure interoperability, evolving and adapting to the operational environment (self-learning), including indoor and outdoor conditions, the availability of energy from local RES generation, the availability and price of energy from grids and local energy storage capacities. Also the possibility of clustering individual demand response services, self-generation and storage at district level should be considered. Such solutions should be effective and resilient, ensuring low operational and maintenance costs and could include functions for predictive maintenance. Solutions should be compatible and appropriately integrated with smart grids via open standards, taking into account existing standards as well as standards under development. The proposed activities should clearly involve and engage building occupants, helping them to become an interactive part of the demand response solution, as well as better managing their energy demand. Proposals should involve energy suppliers (DSOs) and industrial technology suppliers.
The topic EUB-02-2017 (""Utilities: energy management at home and in buildings"") in Part 5.i Information and Communication Technologies of the Work Programme is also relevant and addresses similar challenges.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic will be implemented under the PPP on Energy-efficient Buildings. The activities are expected to be implemented at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6-8 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Facilitate the deployment of solutions that would improve demand response in buildings.
Real time optimisation of energy demand and supply integrating demand-response into intelligent building energy management systems and/or other systems.
High replicability across the EU.
Energy cost savings through integrated home automation solutions.
Higher indoor environmental quality and adaptability to external conditions, leading to improved comfort and living standards, while optimising energy consumption.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In industrial and service sectors, energy efficiency investments, which can lead to important energy savings beneficial for the company and society as a whole, are often not implemented due to combination of factors and barriers faced by the actors involved (employees, decision-makers, auditors, ESCO, financial community etc.).
According to the Energy Efficiency Directive, large enterprises are subject to mandatory energy audits unless they are implementing an energy or environmental management system, and SMEs are encouraged to undergo energy audits within the coming years. This represents an opportunity for energy efficiency investments. However, as mentioned in the EEFIG report[1], to ensure that energy audit recommendations lead to actual implementation, it is necessary to change the approach in order to ensure that the results of energy audits provide the relevant financial data and can be addressed at board level.
Energy efficiency also relies on people behaviour and improvement of the energy culture of enterprises and their supply-chain.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on one of the following topics:
Capacity building programmes for qualified and/or accredited experts carrying out energy audits to ensure that they include the necessary financial and technical data which allows decision-makers and financiers to make informed decisions on implementing the energy saving measures identified; this could include the integration of LCCA (Life Cycle Cost Analysis) or NPV (Net Present Value) in energy audits.
Staff trainings and capacity building programmes to enhance corporate policy towards energy efficiency, energy culture (motivations, behaviour change, mitigation of perceived risks and barriers) and sustainable supply-chain initiatives. All actors (from decision makers/corporate board members to employees in each department including purchase) should be targeted.
Proposals should demonstrate how the proposed activities will be continued commercially beyond the project lifetime. Involvement of relevant multiplier organisations is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below (wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets), depending on the scope of the proposal:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project within its duration (in GWh/year per million Euro of EU funding);
Market stakeholders with increased skills/capability/competencies (to be measured in number of people with increased capacity) and long-lasting training tools;
Number of people/enterprises with enhanced energy culture documenting why and how changes are an effect of particular measures taken, as well in terms of the sustainability of the behavioural change.

In order to reach the EU's energy and climate targets, a qualified building workforce is needed. Improving the skills of middle and senior level professionals and blue collar workers in the area of sustainable energy efficient construction is therefore of key importance. This should be done throughout the entire value chain of the buildings sector. Professionals and blue collar workers also need to be aware of new upcoming challenges relating to nearly-zero energy buildings (for example new materials and, products; the integration of renewable energy sources; new systems or processes such as standardisation and common voluntary certification of buildings and use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools, etc.).
Scope:
The focus of submitted proposals shall be on upgrading or setting up large-scale qualification and training schemes. Proposals are to address coordination and accompanying measures (e.g. voluntary certification schemes, accreditation, mutual recognition, incentives to encourage the participation of craftsmen, sustainability of the schemes, etc.). Running training actions will not be in the scope of the proposal. Proposals may also focus on setting up a mutual recognition scheme of qualifications and certifications among different Member States. Proposals should include a strategy to ensure that qualification and training schemes are sustained after the end of the project. For financial support to trainees, proposals should link to other sources of funding available at national level such as the European Social Fund, including the Youth Guarantee Scheme.
The objective is to increase the number of skilled building professionals and/or blue collar workers across the building value chain (designers, architects, engineers, building managers, technicians, installers[1], blue collar workers including apprentices, and other building professionals) with a specific focus on the engagement of SMEs. Training schemes can also consider operation and maintenance activities. Ultimately, the aim is to improve the overall quality of renovations and new constructions, to accelerate the renovation rate and to ensure proper interactions between different trades and professions. The submitted proposals need to be focused and are not necessarily required to address the whole range of professions and crafts involved in the building sector.
Proposals should take note of the BUILD UP Skills initiative, in particular the strong links with National Qualification Platforms and the implementation of the recommendations of the national qualification Roadmaps, and taking into account the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). They could also be developed with consideration to Erasmus+ actions and in particular the Sector Skills Alliances, which are focused on vocational training. Proposals should develop and roll-out appropriate certification and accreditation schemes to continuously improve knowledge and skills of the building workforce and to increase the quality of construction.
Proposals should focus on improved multidisciplinary approaches and understanding across different trades, for example using BIM, and involving Open BIM initiatives at the national level. They should also focus on improved appreciation of the end user's needs including the quality of indoor environment (thermal and visual comfort, acoustics, air quality, etc.) and improved operation and maintenance. Proposals may include the entire design chain (e.g. manufacturers) and material life cycles and embodied energy in the required skills.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

According to Article 9 of the Energy Performance Buildings Directive (EPBD), Member States shall ensure that by the end of 2020 (2018 for public buildings), all new buildings are Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEB). However, progress is slower than expected and requires the development of market ready cost reduction solutions. Cost-effective integration of renewable energy production elements into NZEB in a form that fits with the construction industry’s design and procurement process is a major challenge. Widespread application and roll out of means for cost effective development of NZEB would accelerate the market. The significant cost reduction that is required to mainstream NZEB by 2018 is likely to revolve around processes rather than technologies. There is an additional need to look beyond NZEB performance with a longer term perspective. Support is also needed to ensure that end users and occupants appreciate the role they play in the building's energy performance.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on reducing the cost of designing and constructing new NZEB in order to increase their market uptake. Proposals should explore how improved performance beyond the NZEB level can be reached whilst maintaining an overall focus on cost reduction.
Proposals should explore the cost-effective ways in which renewable energy generation elements can be integrated into NZEB, either on-site or nearby through district solutions. Proposals could take into account the ways in which these buildings can interact with each other at the district level. Proposals could additionally explore and monitor solutions that improve the end user's experience of these buildings, and which would contribute to greater public acceptance of the need to reduce energy consumption in buildings.
Cost reduction and energy savings should apply to the whole life-cycle of the building. This challenge addresses the whole of the construction process, including inception, planning, design, pre-fabrication, on-site operations and post-construction reviews. Proposals could address one or more aspects of the whole process.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Measurable reduction of construction-related costs compared to the current cost of a new conventional building that meets current building regulations;
Measurable nearly zero (or beyond) energy consumption (including on-site or nearby renewable energy sources) and nearly zero impact of materials used over the whole life cycle;
Demonstration of co-benefits which can have an impact on the real estate value of such buildings and on living/occupancy standards.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Europe needs a robust e-infrastructure supporting Open Access policies, also for Horizon 2020. This infrastructure, based on already existing e-infrastructures (institutional and thematic repositories, aggregators, etc.), should support reliable and permanent access to digital scientific records. A key element will be capacity building to link literature and data in order to enable a more transparent evaluation of research and reproducibility of results. Such an action will include an analysis of alternative means of public support to Gold Open Access in order to identify the optimal approach. The Open Access mandate and the Open Data Pilot of Horizon 2020 impose new requirements for the infrastructures to fully support participants to comply with their obligations and objectives. Therefore, a key objective will be to provide service driven infrastructures to enable wide participation in the Open Data Pilot.
Scope: Proposals should address all the following activities:
(1) Service-driven data e-infrastructure responding to general and specific requirements of researchers and research organisations for open access to and deposit of scientific information (including journal articles, books, monographs, conference proceedings, thesis, grey literature, software and data, as well as services linking literature, data and software). This e-infrastructure will further develop the research capacity through a coordinated and participatory architecture linking institutional and thematic repositories across Europe with scientific information to be used by humans and machines. An essential part of this service-driven approach will be helpdesks designed to support the producers and users of scientific information, human networks to support data sharing and implementation of Open Access policies in Europe, as well as the promotion of technical solutions for sharing of sensitive data (e.g. patient data). The e-infrastructure should be incorporated as a legal entity within the first year of the project.  Relevant indicators on the take-up of open access in Europe including for both publications and data should be elaborated and reported upon regularly. The project will promote a limited set of biblio- and webometrics that reflect open access policies. It will collect bibliometric data on publications, citations, data citations, etc. on all Horizon 2020 scientific output (including on the Open Data Pilot) and produce both standard and on-demand statistics.
(2) Developing proof of concept and prototyping new services in support of open science (e.g. new forms of publishing, innovative services based on data mining, new forms of peer review etc.), assisting researchers and educators in everyday tasks. This includes the accessory task of piloting a mechanism to stimulate publishing in open access journals by paying authors part or all of the article processing charges they incurred after the end of their grant agreement with the Commission[1]. The proposal should indicate the maximum amount to be paid per ‘Gold’ open access publication. Up to three post-grant publications that occur within the two years following the related EU grant expiring may be eligible. Any other conditions that would be necessary to enable as many authors as possible to participate and to ensure that this service contributes to the development of a sustainable and competitive market for scientific open access publishing should be indicated. The duration of the pilot should be 12 to 24 months unless the available budget is exhausted before. Proposals should consider barriers (including legal) to data sharing in the context of these new services and assess the possibility of pan-European information sharing agreements considering the authentication and authorization infrastructure described in topic EINFRA-7-2014.
(3) Supporting the global interoperability of open access data e-infrastructures and linking with similar initiatives across the globe in order to complement the physical access to research facilities with data access and to ensure that Europe plays a leading role in international collaborations.
It is expected that one proposal will be selected. A maximum of EUR 4 million of the total budget for this topic is foreseen for the article processing charges under point (2).
Expected impact:  The intellectual capital of Europe is available to researchers, business and citizens to generate economic and scientific advances now, and that capital is safely preserved for further exploitation by future generations. Open Access publications resulting from Horizon 2020 funded research are available and easily findable online. Data needed to validate published results is linked to the publications and publicly shared whenever possible. Accurate science metrics for Horizon 2020 can be produced with almost no effort. Most of the European institutional repositories (at least 80%) as well as the principal thematic repositories are part of the same interoperable repository network.

Platforms and services are first designed, prototyped and piloted with ""supply and demand-side"" approaches triggered by to the most demanding cases. The innovative developments bringing state-of the-art technology need to evolve and mature to be integrated and offered as dependable e-infrastructures.
Scope:
Proposals will address parts (a) or (b), but not both:
(a) Support to Public Procurement of innovative HPC systems, PPI (proposals should address all points below):
(1) procurement of innovative HPC solutions supporting the deployment in Europe of world-leading HPC capability infrastructure
(2) ensuring and reinforcing European access to European leading-edge supercomputing Tier-0 infrastructures and services, by making available a substantial percentage of the new systems to European researchers in the frame of the Pan-European High Performance Computing infrastructure and services (see EINFRA-11-2016)
(3) diversify the available leading-class HPC capabilities through a rich set of HPC architectures featuring the most advanced technology made available by R&I (Research and Innovation) in Europe, in order to satisfy the needs of a wider range of users in very different key application areas
(4) contribute to the coordination of plans and procurements for the provision of leading-class HPC capabilities at European and national level in view of the implementation the European supercomputing strategy , encompassing funding and technical specifications
(b) Research and Innovation Actions for e-Infrastructure prototypes:
Proposals will address only one of the points below. At least one proposal for each point will be selected:
1. Universal discoverability of data objects and provenance (proposals should address all points below):
Prototyping an e-infrastructure service, based on standards and best-practices, for the uptake of a Digital Identifier e-infrastructure for digital objects (articles, datasets, collections, software, nomenclature, etc.), researchers and contributors, which cuts across geographical, temporal, disciplinary, cultural, organisational and technological boundaries, without relying on a single centralised system but rather federating locally operated systems to ensure interoperability. The requirements of all relevant stakeholder groups (researchers, libraries, data centres, publishers, etc.) should be addressed as well as global interoperability through agreed mechanisms (e.g. in consensus building through the Research Data Alliance).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that one proposal will be selected.
2. Computing e-infrastructure with extreme large datasets (proposals should address all points below):
Develop service prototypes to cope with very large data resources. It should include the basis software layers supporting applications such as modelling, simulation, pattern recognition, visualisation, etc. The developments should be supported by robust mathematical methods and tools. Prototypes should follow an open source approach and aim at common interfaces to access and analyse underlying data collected/stored in different platforms, formats, locations and e-infrastructures and be tested against requirements of very large or highly heterogeneous research data sets. Clean slate approaches to high-performance computing and data management (e.g. HPC-through-the cloud, support of most innovative server’s architectures for distributed computing in particular high Memory/Cores ratios allowing “in memory” processing) targeting 2020+ 'data factory' requirements of research communities and large scale facilities (e.g. ESFRI projects) are encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2.5 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
(a) Support to Public Procurement of innovative HPC systems, PPI: This action will contribution to the European HPC strategy through the creation of a European procurement market for the benefit of the HPC actors in Europe (in particular technology suppliers) and catalysing the efforts to vitalise the European HPC ecosystem.

There is a need to support user-driven design and prototyping of innovative e-infrastructure services and applications to meet the needs of those communities that push the envelope in scientific and technological domains requiring top-of-the range capacity in the long term. It is also important to promote multi-domain community-driven approaches to fully exploit core e-infrastructure services with high economic innovation potential. With the support of, for example, independent software vendors, engineering companies, innovation clusters and Research and technology organisations, e-infrastructures should open up to innovative stakeholders, including researchers, citizens and SMEs, to exploit a wide range of technology developments, research results and data.
Opening e-infrastructures to develop and test innovative functionalities and advanced technology entails the support to Open Science and stairways for excellence to increase citizen's trust in science, bridging the gap between the leading research and education communities and the wider population.
Scope:
Proposals will address only one of the points below. At least one proposal for each point will be selected:
Exploitation of e-infrastructures for user-driven innovation and pilots responding to community specific challenges
(1) Proposals are expected to support, through open e-infrastructure resources, specific requirements of European initiatives addressing societal challenges (e.g. on environment and marine sustainability, agriculture and biodiversity, health and human brain etc.). e-Infrastructures should enable fast prototyping and development of innovative networking, data and computing intensive application and services promoting adaptation, extension and repurposing of basic services. Special attention should be devoted to standardisation to make data and software reusable across the board. The network, data and computing services should lead to economies of scale and facilitate access to resources by innovators.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(2) Proposals are expected to stimulate the innovation potential of innovative actors, SMEs in particular, either as suppliers of technologies and services for e-infrastructures or as users of e-infrastructures to improve their own product and service offering. The proposals shall involve actions led by innovative actors (notably SMEs) for which financial support will be granted (minimum 80% of the EU funding requested by the proposal)[1]. If the maximum financial support per innovative actor exceeds EUR 60.000 (it should however never go beyond EUR 150.000) the proposal should explain why this is necessary for the objectives of the action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that one proposal will be selected.
(3) Development of a pan-European identity federation services for researchers, educators and students, in compliance with existing identity inter-federation efforts (including Eduroam and Edugain). Stimulate AAI services supporting communities involved in the emerging data-rich science era to manage and share their resources. It shall respond to requirements of cybersecurity and information assurance towards integrated identity management across-disciplines and be interoperable at global level.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2.5 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that one proposal will be selected.
Innovation for Open Science e-infrastructures and services
(4) Reuse and improve (performance, quality, reputation, etc) the open access repository and publishing platform infrastructure for prototyping new infrastructure services in support of open science (e.g. new forms of publishing, machine-assisted knowledge extraction services from heterogeneous data resources and strengthening of machine readability and other discovery services). Prototyping of open review and research certification services engaging researchers, educators and students. Also registration and archiving services can be targeted. Developing further and widening the scope of the European Open Science e-infrastructure. Proposals should address an open scientific knowledge management infrastructure in which scientific and educational information repositories and publishing platforms form a visible part of an inter-connected and global knowledge system. Proposals can target any relevant parts of the scientific information ecosystem to enhance the links between literature, data, software, models and other digital objects. The proposed prototypes should have the potential to become part of an interoperable framework in order to enable more efficient digital science as well as transparent evaluation of research and reproducibility of results. Proposals should consider barriers (including legal) to data sharing in the context of these new services and assess the possibility of using pan-European authentication and authorization infrastructures.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Exploitation of e-infrastructures for user-driven innovation and pilots responding to community specific challenges: These actions will accelerate the development of innovative data and computing intensive services in areas of social relevance such as Health, Environment monitoring and management. It will foster the use of open e-infrastructures eco-systems to innovative use promoting smooth collaboration among and between the large European Policy data intensive initiatives. It will bridge the gap between adjacent but not connected scientific communities and promote wide dissemination of data including to the citizens engaged in science. It will support collaboration in data provision and exchange across regional and national related infrastructures allowing the integration of data from a myriad of resources and research communities.
Successful proposals will increase the number of SMEs that are aware of available e-infrastructures resources and services and become active innovators as users and or suppliers of e-infrastructures. Stronger links between e-infrastructure operators and other actors in the innovation chain, such as independent software vendors, innovation clusters and Research and technology organisations, will be put in place. The value of existing scientific information infrastructures will increase with the addition of new interoperable and/or integrated services. Successful proposals will have an impact in making European and global intellectual capital available to researchers, business and citizens. This will support scientific advances now and generate innovation with economic impact leveraging e-infrastructures such as GÉANT. The knowledge capital will be better preserved for further exploitation by future digital-born generations.
Innovation for Open Science e-infrastructures and services: successful proposals will support the objectives of Open Science and contribute, with innovative services, to the modernization of the underlying e-infrastructures and improve access to content and resources through federated management.

Specific challenge: Establishing a limited number of Centres of Excellence (CoE) is necessary to ensure EU competitiveness in the application of HPC for addressing scientific, industrial or societal challenges. CoEs will be user-focused, develop a culture of excellence, both scientific and industrial, placing computational science and the harnessing of 'big data' at the centre of scientific discovery and industrial competitiveness. CoEs may be 'thematic', addressing specific application domains such as medicine, life science or energy; 'transversal' on computational science (e.g. algorithms, analytics, numerical methods etc.); or 'challenge-driven', addressing societal or industrial challenges (e.g. ageing, climate change, clean transport etc.); or a combination of these types.
This topic will be carried out in the context of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in HPC, contributing to the implementation of the EU strategy on High Performance Computing (HPC), in particular to achieving excellence in HPC application delivery and use.
Scope: The CoEs are expected to be:
(1) User-driven, with the application users and owners playing a decisive role in governance;
(2) integrated: encompassing not only HPC software but also relevant aspects of hardware, data management/storage, connectivity, security, etc.;
(3) multidisciplinary: with domain expertise co-located alongside HPC system, software and algorithm expertise;
(4) distributed with a possible central hub, federating capabilities around Europe, exploiting available competences, and ensuring synergies with national/local programmes;
Proposals for CoEs will address:
•     Provision of services such as: developing, optimising (including if needed re-design) and scaling HPC application codes towards peta and exascale computing; testing, validating and maintaining codes and managing the associated data; quality assurance; co-design of hardware, software and codes; consultancy to industry and SMEs; research in HPC applications; and addressing the skills gap in computational science.
•     Working in synergy with the pan-European HPC infrastructure, including by identifying suitable applications for co-design activities relevant to the development of HPC technologies towards exa-scale.
•     Sustainability embracing a wide range of service models and funding from a mixture of sources, including through sponsorship by industry or hybrid public-private models. Clear business plans are expected to be presented in the proposal.
•     Creating communities around specific codes that impact the target sectors, involving ISVs (independent software vendors) where appropriate, and exchange of best practices in particular for SMEs.
•     A governance structure driven by the needs of the users. Commercial management expertise will be needed along with technical expertise to manage industry clients and supply chains, in addition to users from academia.
CoE should provide pan-European support including to European countries and regions with less HPC-resources.
8-10 CoEs are expected to be funded in this topic in order to test the concept. A follow up call is expected in the future that will build on the results and lessons learnt from the present call.
International co-operation is encouraged where there are clear mutual benefits and the partners have the relevant HPC capacity.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:  
         Improved access to computing applications and expertise that enables researchers and industry to be more productive, leading to scientific excellence;
         Improved competitiveness for companies and SMEs through access to CoE expertise and services;
         European leadership in applications that address societal challenges or are important for industrial applications through better code performance and better code maintenance and availability;
         More scientists and engineers trained in the use of computational methods and optimisation of applications.

Specific challenge: HPC competence centres have been set up in some Member States to facilitate access and take-up by industry and in particular SMEs of HPC services. As yet these centres do not cover the whole of Europe. Supporting one network of HPC competence centres will promote access to computational expertise anywhere in Europe and enable the dissemination of best practice in HPC industrial use particularly for SMEs. This topic contributes to the implementation of the European HPC strategy, in particular to foster the use of HPC by SMEs.
Scope: Proposals should address at least the following activities:
(1) networking of existing HPC competence centres providing HPC services to exchange best practices and pool technical, expertise or business resources;
(2) awareness raising and visibility activities of the benefits of HPC for SMEs in particular for countries that do not currently have such centres;
(3) identification of the pool of SMEs and available expertise in the different business areas at European level, and mechanisms to match SME needs and the available expertise;
(4) training (in synergy with the activities carried out by other organisations providing specific training for SMEs in HPC);
The aim is to support one network which will address coordination, outreach, training and the exchange of best practice and software components between the participating national and regional competence centres, complementing their current activities and services with actions of a clear European added-value that cannot be performed at local level. Direct support to adoption of HPC by individual SMEs is not expected to be carried out by this network.
This action will be complementary to the actions carried out in the Nanotechnologies, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing Work Programme 2014-2015 in the specific call for manufacturing, (H2020-FoF-2014/2015) ICT Innovation for Manufacturing SMEs (I4MS) (topic FoF-9-2015).
Expected impact:  
         The network of HPC competence centres will be a reference for best practices for supporting SME competitiveness through access to HPC;
         Increased number of SMEs that are aware of the potential and/or become users of HPC;

Specific challenge: European contribution to the development of global data infrastructures needs to ensure Europe's role as a global player. This can be achieved by strengthening and consolidating Europe's contribution to the Research Data Alliance (RDA), ensuring that RDA fosters research data interoperability and exchange at global level. RDA is an open international forum to create consensus on solutions and best practices to specific problems hampering data exchange and interoperability.
Scope: Proposals will support all of the following points:
(1) definition, operation and monitoring of the governance structures of the Research Data Alliance (RDA); secondment and exchange of staff where appropriate;
(2) active participation of European stakeholders (organisations and individual experts) in RDA and leadership initiatives in strategic working group activities; EU industry involvement and innovation will be promoted in particular;
(3) engaging scientific communities having underdeveloped data infrastructures in defining the best practices for data exchange and interoperability; and
(4) establishing coordination mechanisms at European level (national research funders, European education and research associations) and with international organisations dealing with standardisation, research data and education issues (IETF, W3C, CODATA, OECD, UNESCO, …).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus, the Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme entered into force in 2014 and produces a wealth of data and information regarding the Earth sub-systems (land, atmosphere, oceans) and cross-cutting processes (climate change, emergency and security). Copernicus data and information are mainly made available on a free open and full basis. This is expected to unleash unique market opportunities. It is important to foster market development exploiting the added value of integration of EO observation technologies (both satellite, airborne and ground based) with positioning ones and ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by web) across different market segments through the development of applications, and encourage their insertion into the market.
For such applications and developments to succeed in the market, the product needs to be shaped according to users’ needs and their value to users must be openly demonstrated to the wider user community. This needs to be achieved in an environment integrated at the level of the user, in order for users to accept the innovative potential which the product promises. This will require also specific attention to be given to the various processes in place in the users’ workflows which incorporate the EO information. Furthermore, the transition of R&D product prototypes to viable commercial product lines after the end of the EU funded phase remains a challenge to be addressed early on during product development.
Scope:
Proposals may address a wide variety of applications stemming from the use of Earth observation and its smart integration with other related technologies. Copernicus should be considered as part of the solution which may include other space or non-space inputs. This is likely to lead to greater value, opportunities and especially market uptake. To this aim, a business model and a value chain market analysis, which includes the phase of the project following the end of the public funding, should be part of the proposal.
The outcome of this innovation project should be a commercial service platform, sustained by a production process capable to deliver to the user a product which is validated and accepted as a marketable product. Transnational collaboration has a key role to play in this context, as it enhances access to markets beyond the national borders, notably by enabling space application providers to absorb market-related tacit knowledge and know-how of their partners. Corresponding validations and customisations are to be undertaken, and the business case for the application is to be demonstrated. Service level models are to be developed, with appropriate quality of service definitions for the application. Application products are expected to adopt open standards for data documentation, data models and services including data processing, visualisation and cataloguing.
The choice of EO application is left to the proposer.
Proposers are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general at http://copernicus.eu, and to consult further information on availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data, as well as issues recommended to be detailed in the proposals at the Commission’s website[1].

Specific challenge:
If space investments made in earth observation are to generate economic return, it is essential that EO products and information generation are taken out of the research environment and products are put into the market. Such EO products often realise highly automated processes with minimum manual intervention. For such applications and developments to succeed, the product needs to be shaped according to users’ demands, to be validated and proven. This needs to be achieved in an environment integrated at the user, in order for users to accept the innovative potential which the product promises. This will require also specific attention to be given to the various processes in place in the users’ workflows which incorporate the EO information. Furthermore, the commercial providers will have to prove that they can sustain their product operationally based on market revenues. To this end a credible planning for the 3 years after the end of public funding shall be part of the proposal.
Scope:
The outcome of this innovation project should be a commercial service platform, sustained by a production process capable to deliver to the user a product which is validated and accepted as a marketable product. Transnational collaboration has a key role to play in this context, as it enhances access to markets beyond the national borders, notably by enabling space application providers to absorb market-related tacit knowledge and know-how of their partners. Corresponding validations and customisations are to be undertaken, and the business case for the application is to be demonstrated. Service level models are to be developed, with appropriate quality of service definitions for the application. Application products are expected to adopt open standards for data documentation, data models and services.
The choice of EO application is left to the proposer. A preference will also be given to SMEs, which are considered to be particularly important players in this European EO applications sector.

Copernicus, the Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme entered into force in 2014 and produces a wealth of data and information regarding the Earth sub-systems (land, atmosphere, oceans) and cross-cutting processes (climate change, emergency and security). Copernicus data and information are mainly made available on a free open and full basis. This is expected to unleash unique market opportunities. It is important to foster market development exploiting the added value of integration of EO observation technologies (both satellite, airborne and ground based) with positioning ones and ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by web) across different market segments through the development of applications, and encourage their insertion into the market.
For such applications and developments to succeed in the market, the product needs to be shaped according to users’ needs and their value to users must be openly demonstrated to the wider user community. This needs to be achieved in an environment integrated at the level of the user, in order for users to accept the innovative potential which the product promises. This will require also specific attention to be given to the various processes in place in the users’ workflows which incorporate the EO information. Furthermore, the transition of R&D product prototypes to viable commercial product lines after the end of the EU funded phase remains a challenge to be addressed early on during product development.
Scope:
Proposals may address a wide variety of applications stemming from the use of Earth observation and its smart integration with other related technologies. Copernicus should be considered as part of the solution which may include other space or non-space inputs. This is likely to lead to greater value, opportunities and especially market uptake. To this aim, a business model, which includes the phase of the project following the end of the public funding, should be part of the proposal.
The outcome of this innovation project should be a commercial service platform, sustained by a production process capable to deliver to the user a product which is validated and accepted as a marketable product.

Specific Challenge:
Research areas such as Climate Change address long time periods of data records, where historical data are essential to identify reliable trends and anomalies. The data from past remote sensing missions available either from European and non-European missions, must be made accessible in a way to establish seamless time series of similar observations, contributing to the generation of Climate Data Records across sensors and technologies over two decades and more. At the same time, the relevance of space derived variables and products needs to be critically examined, and enhanced to optimally fit the requirements arising from current policy issues in a variety of EU sectors. This includes the needs of  assessment of impact of climate change, as well as mitigation and adaptation strategies in different societal benefit areas. This work is complementary to efforts undertaken by ESA in the Climate Change Initiative (CCI), and will require coordination with on-going efforts accordingly.
Scope:
The remote sensing data maintained in archives of the relevant data holding agencies will require to be reprocessed to ensure the generation of consistent time series of data and products with the most up to date operational algorithms. These time series shall benefit from the panoply of available source data to ensure suitability for producing the most reliable, accurate, stable and complete Climate Data Records. Manipulation of historical data at the relevant sources will be required to enable quick analyses, bulk reprocessing and wide access to different science and application communities. Interoperability of diverse observation collections, including all parts of the atmosphere and its boundary (such as ice, fresh water, sea surface and land surface), tropospheric and stratospheric data, sensor calibration and sensor-to-sensor cross calibration will have to be included, as well as estimates of the associated uncertainties, limits and biases. The proposed activities will need to be closely coordinated with the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and other relevant initiatives of space data calibration in context of CEOS or GEO.

Expected Impact:
The proposal is expected to significantly contribute to the availability of validated space-based observational data on Climate Change as a long time series, providing consistent Climate Data Records over a time period corresponding to the satellite era. Close cooperation with other relevant on-going activities such the ESA CCI and GEO is expected. Proposers should demonstrate how the work performed adds value to existing data repositories and efforts by the respective remote sensing data holding agencies. Best practices in combining data from different satellites and other sensor in consistent ways should be established and promoted.

Specific challenge: Europe’s investment in the Copernicus Sentinel satellites will provide Europe with an unprecedented source of operational satellite data. The first and largest streams of data will become available from Sentinel 1 (SAR data) during 2014, to be followed shortly thereafter with data from Sentinels 2 and 3 (optical imaging data), as well as Sentinel 5p. In the longer term also major contributions for atmospheric measurements will be made by Sentinels 4 and 5. Data streams are expected to amount to several terabyte per satellite orbit, thereby delivering unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution and data continuity, calling for new data handling and processing paradigms. While this data is ingested into the operational Copernicus services, wide use by the scientific community and industry researchers for developing products is still limited and needs to be stimulated with easy-to-use interfaces for  performing R&D. Where appropriate, integration into operational services such as Copernicus may require the efficiency of highly automated processes with minimum manual intervention.
Scope: To fully benefit from the high scientific, operational and commercial potential of the Sentinel data, development tools, as well as stable and predictable access methods need to be developed, such as:
         development of simulators of space based earth observation data, to facilitate the uptake of EO data, and to prepare data processing chains;
         research into efficient information retrieval from satellite data repositories and dissemination;
         developing software to read and transform data for access by scientific, institutional and commercial users, including data mining techniques;
         developing data co-registration and fusion methods (data from several sentinels and /or other contributing satellite missions);
         advanced visualisation techniques (allowing also for sensory exploration of data beyond visual experience);
         efficient and validated sentinel data integration methods for operational service use.
The ability to access diverse space data archives, of large volumes of data, the use of standardised forms of data query, retrieval, formats and data exchange methods will be central to these tasks. Attention should be given to platforms offering novel methods able to cope with the big data challenge (storage, processing, remote access, etc.). A particular aspect of interest is also the international use of Sentinel data, as acceptance of Copernicus data in a global context will be a key to success of Europe’s contribution of Copernicus to GEOSS.  Such collaboration necessitates also appropriate data sharing interfaces for sentinel data to be developed and agreed upon, based on open source solutions as far as possible.
Proposers are advised to consult further information on availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data, as well as issues recommended to be detailed in the proposals at the Commission’s web http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/research.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Significantly wider use of Copernicus Sentinel data should be achieved, in Europe as well as internationally. Increased awareness with users of satellite data is to be generated and further opportunities for new uptake of satellite data should be created. Possible models for operational supply of data to users, including for further scientific exploitation should be demonstrated. For methods designed for operational deployment in services, proposals are expected to collaborate closely with services and downstream users to ensure that commercial and operational opportunities are fully identified and exploited. The work should contribute to the definition of best practices and their adoption in scientific and commercial user communities, and in a GEOSS context if possible.
This research topic should attract active participation of researchers in academia and industry, specialising on the use of sentinel data and their integration and/or comparison with other sensor data (from space or in-situ). It should actively involve students performing research with satellite data.

Copernicus, the Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme entered into force in 2014 and produces a wealth of data and information regarding the Earth sub-systems (land, atmosphere, oceans) and cross-cutting processes (climate change, emergency and security). Such information can be very helpful for reporting obligations of Member States and can enable informed decision-making. At the same time such information needs either adaptation to local conditions and contexts, or adaptation to the specific needs of public authorities as part of workflow and procedures. The challenge is to deepen user integration and thus foster exploitation of Copernicus information to match the needs of public authorities at national, regional or local levels.
New and innovative solutions are needed to address the existing and emerging societal challenges faced among others by the public sector. Some of these societal challenges require public sector transformations for which no commercial stable solutions exist, and that require a more forward looking public procurement strategy either through incremental or radical innovation.
Scope:
The objective is to launch demand-driven innovation actions by public authorities aiming at customising Copernicus information as part of the solution (i.e. possibly alongside other space or non-space data sources) for their needs. Transnational collaboration has a key role to play in this context, as it can facilitate knowledge transfer and optimisation of resources for public authorities. It also fosters service providers who can benefit from an strengthened digital single market. Application products are expected to adopt open standards for data documentation, data models and services.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Effective access to Copernicus dedicated mission data and Copernicus service information by public and private users is a sine qua non condition for the achievement of Copernicus' objectives.
In this context, Copernicus faces important challenges. First, the multiplicity of Copernicus partners involved in Copernicus dissemination activities requires both flexible and effective coordination. At the moment Copernicus dissemination infrastructure is built around different dissemination platforms operated by ESA, EUMETSAT, and service operators. In addition some Member States provide access to Sentinel data in the context of the collaborative ground segment. Second, the sheer volume of data and information to be disseminated and used puts Copernicus at the forefront of the big data challenges. This new paradigm requires a change of approach to data curation and dissemination, in the form of a technological leap to both ingest processing and make available the increased volume of Copernicus data and information considering both temporal and spatial resolutions. The Big Data paradigm offers new perspectives for data intensive activities where Europe could still close its technological gap with the US with huge industrial implications.
The free, full and open data policy will support the development of a strong Earth observation downstream service industry if an effective and scalable access system is implemented to meet the Big Data exploitation challenges and to address the full data cycle needs (e.g. standardised data query, retrieval, data exchange methods, processing and data fusion involving diverse datasets). Therefore, Europe needs to foster Copernicus access and dissemination services spurred by a vibrant European downstream sector taking advantage of the timely availability of the Copernicus data and information to provide innovative Earth observation information products on a worldwide basis, based on European Internet platforms using advanced big data technologies and serving a worldwide market.
The future Copernicus data access architecture is expected to follow the following broad approach:
A back office service essentially ensuring access to Copernicus data and information and offering storage and processing capacities.
Different front office services managed by intermediate users (public or private) would serve the need of other intermediate users or end-users via appropriate tool (e.g. search, visualisation, data analytics, knowledge extraction, animation of user communities, etc.
Intermediate layers allowing the exploitation of the back office resources for the benefit of the various front offices as well as providing the necessary modules to foster EO data analytics and the chaining of value adding activities between different front offices.
This multi-layered approach would allow the mutualisation and efficient use of storage and processing capacities (generic or EO-specific) while providing flexibility to Copernicus services, Member States, intermediate commercial users to engage with and serve their constituency with localised/specialised higher value services.
Scope:
Activities are expected to address the adaptation of big data technologies to Copernicus user scenarios and should concentrate on the intermediate layers describe above. They shall enable Copernicus services, public and intermediate commercial users to engage with and serve their constituency with localised/specialised higher value services.
Activities should include the development of tools allowing for the chaining of different value adding activities increasing incrementally the information and knowledge content of EO and non EO data and possibly triggering new commercial initiatives. The aim would be to allow many users either public or private to provide advanced services to intermediate or end users without having to build up storage and processing capacities for Copernicus data and information but benefiting from the storage and processing services provided by ICT companies.
Big Data, activities shall bridge the gap between Earth observation and information technology sectors taking into account the user needs for EO Big Data and aiming at developing innovative solutions taking into account the needs of 1) non-expert users like policy makers involved in societal challenges, 2) experts involved, and 3) small and medium innovative enterprises. Activities shall be complementary to activities enabled by the ICT and research infrastructures work programmes which address generic challenges in the area of data mining, open linked data, web ontology, digital earth[1].
Activities should address any relevant aspect of the data lifecycle which can solve EO big data challenges, in particular data management activities (e.g. collection, processing including online processing, quality control, documentation, dissemination, cataloguing, preservation, usage tracking, integration) and usage activities (e.g. discovery, analysis (including visual), product generation, user feedback, tagging, knowledge extraction, decision making). Activities are also expected to extensively use flexible coverage and open processing standards.
Activities shall rely on open source software/tools/modules/plug-ins and shall include small-scale demonstrations.
Proposers are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general and linked actions within Copernicus including the Integrated Ground Segment at the Commission's website[2]. An information document is published together with this work programme[3].
Proposers are invited to consult further information on availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data, as well as issues recommended to be detailed in the proposals at the Commission’s website[4].
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Enable value adding services on generic data and information storage and processing facilities which can allow public and commercial users effective production environment to interact with and serve their user base without deploying their own storage and processing facilities.
Make access to the Copernicus data and information easy and user friendly through scalable dissemination and exploitation software based on international standards.
Foster the establishment of interoperable access facilities to all EU Member States.
Link with other big data initiatives.
Provide user community tools including best-practices.
Ensure resilience of the overall dissemination and exploitation system.
Optimise the use of Copernicus data by non-traditional user communities to meet societal challenges.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Climate research, and atmospheric research, are cases that clearly illustrates the full complexity of needs for validation and calibration of space data, and hence of the remote sensing data at source. The latter includes a range of sensors operated by different space agencies that all need to be sufficiently reliable and accurate to contribute efficiently to the generation of Climate Data Records. More atmospheric species, as well as aerosols, need to be monitored, simultaneously and for the same air mass, at local to global level. The transport and dispersion of these various constituents are critical quantities to be monitored. Space based remote sensing data have to be integrated with measurements taken at  various places in the atmosphere, from the middle atmosphere down to ground level. Efforts must be coordinated at national and international levels to optimize the use of existing in-situ measurements, establishing observation profiles, the deployment of new measuring systems and the design of campaigns dedicated to the calibration and validation of remote sensing data. Vicarious calibration techniques requires detailed and complete documentation of the state of the atmosphere at time of satellite overpasses over a variety of land, water and icy surfaces to span a large range of environmental conditions. The integrated use of different technologies or tools for measuring the atmospheric effects can promote further the earth observation for monitoring the environment.
A comprehensive 3-D coverage has to be developed and implemented together with an appropriate validation strategy. While calibration and validation campaigns are conducted at national and international level, particularly to validate specific sensors and satellites, a European coordinated approach in charting systematically the available and needed instrument suites for systematic climate change monitoring in space and time, and the correspondingly required validation campaigns remains elusive.  
Scope: To achieve this, research is needed to assess gaps in remote observation availability and suitable approaches for defining virtual observation constellations. It should include mapping of ground based networks, airborne, balloons and sub-orbital platforms as well as space based sensors. Appropriate calibration and validation of data is to be assessed, charting the campaigns that will be needed to cover the climate change monitoring needs in years to come from remote sensing data gathered over land, water and icy surfaces. A mapping of available/deployed sensor technologies and measurements should be performed as a first step, to identify gaps in available systems and current knowledge to characterise the atmospheric, measure atmospheric profiles,  profiles and different ground level conditions and ensure the provision of reliable and accurate Climate Data Records for the atmosphere, land surfaces and oceans. This information should also lay the basis for drawing up the need for dedicated calibration and validation campaigns combining instruments and measurements deployed in ground based networks, airborne, UAV, balloons, sub-orbital and in-orbit platforms, as relevant for climate change monitoring. Since this activity is highly reliant on consensus of the users in form of the scientific community involved in subsequent climate change and atmospheric measurements/modelling, the proposal will have to mobilise such key players across Europe and globally, and will have to include mechanisms regarding best practices to reach a consensus on the strategies proposed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The proposal is expected to lead to significant advances in greater consistency and cross-calibration/validation of long term space based measurements with ground-based historical references, providing a better overview of uncertainty of available data to generate Climate Data Records, including impacts information of space data. Based on the work done, best practices regarding calibration/validation campaigns should be promoted. Proposals are expected to add value to the work of bodies such as the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), WMO Integrated Observing System (WIGOS) and the ESA Climate Modelling User Group.
While this action addresses climate relevant issues, monitored parameters and their uncertainty are important for many other purposes (air pollution, air traffic management etc.) and  the  availability of project material to the wider GMES/Copernicus community should be ensured as well.

It remains to be established for which areas of Earth observation (land monitoring, atmospheric measurements, water quality, maritime surveillance, emergency management, security,  etc.) this approach might be particularly effective, be it in performance, risk management and cost effectiveness. Equally, it needs to be understood which technologies would be needed to allow a network/constellation to act as one instrument. Specific requirements for the sensors may also be needed to allow benefit to be taken of such mission concepts.
Scope: Research should be undertaken to review the emerging fractionated observation system concepts. The required technology challenges as regards interfacing, synchronisation, formation flying, precision thrusting and pointing, communication within the constellation or with ground stations are to be identified. Potential benefits to be obtained (e.g. monitoring performance, risk mitigation, cost effectiveness, responsiveness) are to be examined in light of observation needs in different earth observation domains. Observation needs should be validated with the respective user communities to be fit for purpose in terms of scientific and commercial applications. Constellations of instruments might be of the same instrument type, or include a variety of different instruments and related data fusion approaches. Demands for data transfers and communication should be examined in light of current developments of high-speed in-space communication methodologies. The results obtained should enable mission designers and implementers to decide what missions should be initiated for which application areas, and the requirements for communications support.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals are expected to contribute to increasing the effectiveness of future developments by addressing
         significant advances in performance
         greater coherency between different measurement sources,
         mission planning parameters,
         mission scalability and incremental deployment.

","Research and Innovation action
","10 November 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus operational services are not static, but need to evolve with recognised and emerging user requirements and state of the art methodologies. While immediate service maintenance and enhancement in response to the Copernicus work programme is part of operational tasks, long-term evolutions will need input from R&D outside the programme. A process has been put in place in the Copernicus services by the Entrusted Entities to review service evolution and any emerging adaptation needs as to their urgency, closeness to the operational delivery process, and availability of capacities. R&D activities which are suitable for Horizon 2020 are identified to this end by the Commission and/or the Entrusted Entities for each service. An information document is published together with this work programme[1]. The challenge is to have the results of R&D available in a sufficiently timely manner to support an informed discussion, if and under which conditions an evolution of the operational service portfolio of the Copernicus service is appropriate. The schedule of the activities should thus consider the overall planning of the Copernicus programme and its specific services concerned.
Scope:
The research and innovation action should aim at demonstrating the technical operational feasibility of a specific service evolution proposal. The proposers are expected to demonstrate at the proposal stage an active link with the Copernicus service by suitable means. The output of these research and innovation project should aim at providing a proof-of-concept or a prototype for a proposed evolution of the Copernicus services, respecting the border between Copernicus services and downstream services. This proof-of-concept or prototype should allow to demonstrate the appropriateness to implement the proposed evolution later on at European level, i.e. potentially with operational Copernicus funding. To allow a discussion of such potential operational funding, the activity should as well result into one or more possible scenarios how this evolution could potentially be integrated into the existing service architecture and if it could be built on the existing observation data or if new observation requirements would be needed.
Proposers are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general at http://copernicus.eu, the evolution topics identified there, as well as the availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data at the Commission’s website[2].
The proposal should indicate:
To what extent the proposed evolution could be a candidate for the operational Copernicus service in terms of cost-benefits, calendar and operational feasibility;
The conditions for making available, for use and exploitation, the results (including IPR) to the entities implementing the EU Copernicus programme, including its contractors and service providers;
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Enhance the European industry’s potential to take advantage of emerging market opportunities and capacity to establish leadership in the field;
Boost competitiveness of the industrial actors in EU and national procurements;
Establish a proof-of-concept or a prototype, which can act as reference for the independent assessment of Copernicus service evolution, in light of product extensions and service improvements.

","Coordination and support action
","08 November 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A recent expert report has assessed the need and opportunity for an independent European capacity for CO2 anthropogenic emissions, which includes space-borne observation. It recommends stepwise approach to implement a requirement-driven integration of remote-sensing, in situ and modelling capabilities for an operational end-to-end system. While the report recognises the importance of other observing other GHGs contributing to global warming it focuses on closing specifically the gap of monitoring anthropogenic CO2 emissions linked to the COP21 context. Also, as the use of satellite observations has been rather successful for CH4 flux inversions in the past, the potential to monitor other GHGs in particular methane and carbon monoxide are to be investigated only as secondary mission objectives in this coordination and support action (CSA). It is noteworthy that designing a space-borne observation instrument for CO2 anthropogenic emissions will largely benefit from lessons learnt in the context of the European Space Agency's Earth Explorer programme 8 with the Carbonsat exploratory mission.
The development, the implementation and eventually the operation of such a European capacity will need the involvement of various players, such as space agencies, operators of in-situ measurement stations and of numerical weather prediction, leading experts for modelling and data assimilation. In particular, it has to build on past activities of the European Space Agency (ESA) and will be coordinated with the ESA's on-going and future programmes. Initiating the establishment of this community while delivering first concrete elements is at the heart of this action to cluster all relevant existing competences within Europe on the CO2 emissions topic and thus reach the critical mass required for addressing such a challenging endeavour.
Following the Copernicus Space Component Evolution Plan, the Commission has set up a CO2 monitoring task force with two work packages addressing separate but interconnected tasks. The first work package (Task A co-convened by ESA and the Commission) is dealing with the Space Component (specifically: a CO2 pre-operational mission), the second work package task (Task B convened by the Commission) is addressing the end-to-end operational emission monitoring system, including in addition inverse modelling, in-situ observation networks, and emission inventories. These activities will be conducted in full collaboration with ESA, EUMETSAT and ECMWF. As regards the interaction with the Task Force, the CSA is expected to act as an accompanying scientific and technical support to the CO2 monitoring task force, which in turn will provide the necessary programmatic guidance.
Scope:
To advance in a coordinated preparation of a mature European capacity there is need to bring together the key European stakeholders and competent entities which are engaged in activities that can answer the questions outlined below, have the ability to network with suitable research actors to fill the knowledge gaps, and have the required expertise to assess the needs for an end-to-end operational system, with due attention to potential international cooperation opportunities for tackling this global challenge.
Activities will encompass the coordination of ongoing efforts, include mutual identification of research and infrastructural gaps, and facilitate a cooperation of further research and development to be undertaken to reach sufficiently mature capacities for an operational integration as a subsequent step.
The following four areas need to be coordinated to prepare a suitable and operational European approach. To be adequate, the responses to these series of questions addressing engineering oriented issues should capitalize and benefit from basic research projects as available in the H2020 framework and ESA preparatory studies:
1. Reconciling top down and bottom up estimates
The combined use of both satellite and in-situ observations with advanced data assimilation techniques should offer the possibility to monitor the emissions of anthropogenic CO2 and at the same time to better quantify the biogenic fluxes. However, satellite or surface measurements and different assimilation systems may currently deliver different estimates of sources and sinks of CO2. There is thus a strong need to improve both the processing of satellite observations as well as the structure of the data assimilation systems (e.g., components, modelling framework), in particular when systems are conceived for implementation in an operational context like Copernicus. Empirical bias correction schemes have been designed for satellite observations to reconcile satellite versus in-situ flux estimates, but the origin of the inconsistencies is still debated: possible weaknesses of the chemistry transport models that link the two types of measurements, possible systematic errors of the retrieval algorithms or the high impact of biased prior information from external sources on the estimated fluxes are three causes that have been mentioned, among others. There is a need to reduce or even remove the empiricism from the processing chains for these measurements in order to increase their effective impact for carbon studies. Additionally, especially for flux estimates at national and sub-national scales, the transport model component of both the transport inversion schemes and the carbon cycle/Fossil Fuel data assimilation systems (CCDAS/FFDAS alike) needs to be improved, and more observational constraints need to be integrated in an objective way to separate fossil from biogenic fluxes and reduce uncertainty in the derived flux estimates.
Studies are to be undertaken, and ongoing efforts by participants are to be directed at reducing or even avoiding the need for satellite bias-correction schemes by proposing new methods (e.g., CCDAS as a physically-based filtering tool), new numerical experiments, and/or inter-comparison exercises, that allow identifying the origin of the above-mentioned biases, regardless their origin (measurements, physical equations, inputs to the physical equations, etc.). Proposals should also address current weaknesses of data assimilation systems with for instance the use of better transport model, improved model data fusion techniques or advanced surface flux descriptions.
2. Library of simulations for emissions and atmospheric transport
The development of an operational capacity for monitoring fossil CO2 emissions needs to be based on a series of simulations of these emissions and atmospheric transport at the relevant spatial and temporal resolutions. The simulations should build upon actual inventory emissions derived from a catalogue of emission objects and uncertainties. These simulations should feature patterns representative of regions such as Europe benefiting from good bottom up data infrastructure reporting accurate inventories of emissions as well as other regions reporting less accurate but important contributions to the global CO2 emissions. These simulations should be as realistic as possible that is, accounting for the natural CO2 sinks and source fluxes, including cloud cover, atmospheric aerosol load and type and any other atmospheric contributions that could hinder the retrieval of atmospheric CO2 content from space-borne sensors operating in the NIR and SWIR spectral domains.
Studies are to be undertaken, and ongoing efforts by participants are to be directed at providing series of simulation scenarios that could serve to adequately dimension a space mission, in particular as regards the spatial and temporal sampling that would be required to assess the fossil fuel emissions with a limited enough uncertainty to make it useful for policy makers.
3. Uncertainty trade-off for fossil fuel emissions
The adequate dimensioning of the ensemble of space-borne and in-situ observations to monitor fossil fuel CO2 emission must be driven by requirements from policymakers in charge of assessing the impacts of international agreements that foresee the reduction of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. The monitoring of anthropogenic emissions from space-borne sensors involves inverse transport modelling methods together with source and sink process models that have intrinsic limits regarding the accuracies that can be reached. It is essential to assess these current limits, so that the likely emission uncertainties associated with ensemble CO2 observations can be estimated reliably for a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions. The potential synergies between actual CO2 emissions estimates based on physical measurements and those derived from inventories and statistics should be addressed as well in view of reducing the overall budget of emission uncertainties.
Studies are to be undertaken, and ongoing efforts by participants are to be directed evaluating the current state of affairs and the possible improvements that should issue from an enhanced space-borne and in-situ observation scenarios. These studies should
be based on a few modelling scenarios capturing typical situations of CO2 emissions and atmospheric transport and accounting for biogenic sources and sinks;
consider different scenarios regarding the density, reliability and quality of the information available in-situ;
establish metrics and methods to assess CO2 emission uncertainties at the appropriate scales and time-space resolutions;
outline a set of concrete protocols for undertaking future closure experiments between top down and bottom up emission datasets at a variety of scales.
4. Attributing CO2 emissions from in-situ measurements
Physically-based estimates of fossil fuel CO2 emissions using jointly transport and process models together with space-borne observations require dedicated in-situ observation networks to attribute the emissions to anthropogenic activities in contrast to natural sources. Several techniques are available to achieve this task including measurements of atmospheric CO and radiocarbon concentration measurements. The latter are critically dependent on in-situ sampling and, consequently, sampling protocols have to be established according to the spatial and temporal variability of the main emission sources and the required space-time resolution of the estimates. Sampling scenarios need to be elaborated which could optimally contribute to achieving the task.
Studies are to be undertaken, and ongoing efforts by participants are to evaluate the optimisation of in-situ network of radiocarbon measurements in the space-time dimension so that concurrent CO2 observations from space-borne instruments can be fully exploited to derive accurate estimates of fossil fuel emissions. To this end, a family of typical emission scenarios representing local and regional scales processes have to be considered. These scenarios should feature a range of realistic cases and conditions that could be taken as representative of a larger ensemble of occurrences. The optimization of the sampling procedures should be based on generic techniques enabling to trace the sources and evolutions of the uncertainties in the assessment of the contributing fossil fuel emissions.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3.5 million with a duration of two to three years would allow this specific challenge with its several components to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting other amounts. It is intended to fund a single project coordinating the different activities listed above.
Expected Impact:
The proposal is expected to lay the mature foundation for an independent space-borne observation capacity for CO2 in the context of Europe's Climate Change challenges. Coordination and networking efforts are expected to lay the foundation for the operational integration of all relevant European capacities as a subsequent step.
More specifically, the results are to:
Make a significant contribution to addressing the unresolved issue of ground-based versus space derived estimates of CO2 fluxes.
Generate a large database of CO2 sources, sinks and atmospheric transport processes to help dimensioning the various elements to develop an operational EU anthropogenic CO2 emission monitoring capacity.
Establish a set of requirements regarding the accuracy as well as spatial and temporal resolutions for anthropogenic CO2 emissions estimates, such that the policymakers can be provided with reliable CO2 emission trends to evaluate the impact of (I)NDCs.
Shape the appropriate dimension and distribution of a surface network to separate biogenic from anthropogenic CO2 emissions."

Objectives
Frontier research often generates unexpected or new opportunities for commercial or societal application. The ERC Proof of Concept Grants aim to maximise the value of the excellent research that the ERC funds, by funding further work (i.e. activities which were not scheduled to be funded by the original ERC frontier research grant) to verify the innovation potential of ideas arising from ERC funded projects. Proof of Concept Grants are therefore on offer only to Principal Investigators whose proposals draw substantially on their ERC funded research.
Ethical Principles
All proposals will be subject to ethics review as with proposals for the ERC's frontier research grants.
Maximum size of grant and grant assessment
The financial contribution will be up to a maximum of EUR 150 000 for a period of 18 months. The ERC expects that normally, proof of concept projects should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, projects will be signed for 18 months. Given this initial flexibility, extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.
The overall level of the funding offered will be assessed during the evaluation. The funding requested by the applicant will be judged against the needs of the proposed activity before award. The funding requested by the Principal Investigator must be fully justified by an estimation of the actual costs for the proposed activities.
The Union financial contribution will take the form of the reimbursement of up to 100% of the total eligible and approved direct costs and of flat-rate financing of indirect costs on the basis of 25% of the total eligible direct cost (Excluding the direct costs for subcontracting and the costs of resources made available by third parties which are not used on the premises of the host institution). The level of the awarded grant represents a maximum overall figure – the final amount to be paid must be justified on the basis of the costs actually incurred for the project.
The indicative budget for this call for 2017 is EUR 20 000 000 (approximately one-third of which will be for each of the three evaluation rounds following three specific deadlines)."

There is little prospect of an application succeeding in the absence of such a record, which identifies investigators as exceptional leaders in terms of originality and significance of their research contributions.
Thus, in most fields, Principal Investigators of Advanced Grant proposals will be expected to demonstrate a record of achievements appropriate to the field and at least matching one or more of the following benchmarks:
10 publications as main author (or in those fields where alphabetic order of authorship is the norm, joint author) in major international peer-reviewed multidisciplinary scientific journals, and/or in the leading international peer-reviewed journals and peer-reviewed conferences proceedings of their respective field;
3 major research monographs, of which at least one is translated into another language. This benchmark is relevant to research fields where publication of monographs is the norm (e.g. humanities and social sciences).
Other alternative benchmarks that may be considered (individually or in combination) as indicative of an exceptional record and recognition in the last 10 years:
5 granted patents;
10 invited presentations in well-established internationally organised conferences and advanced schools;
3 research expeditions led by the applicant Principal Investigator;
3 well-established international conferences or congresses where the applicant was involved in their organisation as a member of the steering and/or organising committee;

The financial contribution will be awarded as a lump sum of EUR 150 000 for a period of 18 months. The ERC expects that normally proof of concept activities should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, the grant agreements will be signed for 18 months. Extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.
The lump sum will cover the beneficiaries' direct and indirect eligible costs for the project: if the project is implemented properly the amounts will be paid regardless of the costs actually incurred. The lump sum has been designed to cover the beneficiaries’ personnel costs, subcontracting, purchase costs, others cost categories and indirect costs.
Profile of the ERC Proof of Concept Eligible Principal Investigator:
All Principal Investigators in one of the main grants are eligible to participate and apply for an ERC Proof of Concept Grant. Principal Investigators in an ongoing main grant are eligible to apply to both Proof of Concept calls. Principal Investigators in a main grant that has ended less than 12 months before 1 January 2021 are eligible to apply only to call ERC-2022-PoC1. Principal Investigators in a main grant that has ended less than 12 months before 1 January 2022 are eligible to apply to both calls ERC-2022-PoC1 and ERC-2022-PoC2.
Principal Investigators may submit only one proposal under each Work Programme 2022 Proof of Concept call. If further submissions are made at different cut-off dates under call ERC-2022-PoC2, only the first admissible and eligible proposal will be considered.
Synergy Grant Principal Investigators are eligible to apply only with the written consent of all Principal Investigators in the same Synergy Grant project.

Objectives
Advanced Grants are designed to support excellent Principal Investigators at the career stage at which they are already established research leaders with a recognised track record of research achievements. Applicant Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal.
Size of ERC Advanced Grants
Advanced Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of EUR 2 500 000 for a period of 5 years.
However, up to an additional EUR 1 000 000 can be requested in the proposal to cover (a) eligible ""start-up"" costs for Principal Investigators moving to the EU or an Associated Country from elsewhere as a consequence of receiving the ERC grant, and/or (b) the purchase of major equipment and/or (c) access to large facilities.
Profile of the ERC Advanced Grant Principal Investigator
ERC Advanced Grant Principal Investigators are expected to be active researchers and to have a track record of significant research achievements in the last 10 years which must be presented in the application. There is little prospect of an application succeeding in the absence of such a record, which identifies investigators as exceptional leaders in terms of originality and significance of their research contributions.
Thus, in most fields, Principal Investigators of Advanced Grant proposals will be expected to demonstrate a record of achievements appropriate to the field and at least matching one or more of the following benchmarks:
-        10 publications as senior author (or in those fields where alphabetic order of authorship is the norm, joint author) in major international peer-reviewed multidisciplinary scientific journals, and/or in the leading international peer-reviewed journals and peer-reviewed conferences proceedings of their respective field;
-        3 major research monographs, of which at least one is translated into another language. This benchmark is relevant to research fields where publication of monographs is the norm (e.g. humanities and social sciences).
Other alternative benchmarks that may be considered (individually or in combination) as indicative of an exceptional record and recognition in the last 10 years:
-        5 granted patents;
-        10 invited presentations in well-established internationally organised conferences and advanced schools;
-        3 research expeditions led by the applicant Principal Investigator;
-        3 well-established international conferences or congresses where the applicant was involved in their organisation as a member of the steering and/or organising committee;
-        International recognition through scientific or artistic prizes/awards or membership in well-regarded Academies or artefact with documented use (for example, architectural or engineering design, methods or tools);
-        Major contributions to launching the careers of outstanding researchers;
-        Recognised leadership in industrial innovation.

Objectives (expected outcome)
The European Pillar of Social Rights has set out key principles and rights for a renewed process of upward convergence towards i.e. fair working conditions in particular in the areas of secure and adaptable employment, wages, information about employment conditions and protection in case of dismissals, social dialogue and involvement of workers, etc. The general objective of this call for proposals is therefore contributing to the implementation of the key principles of the pillar in the area of posting of workers, i.e to fund initiatives in order to enhance the implementation and correct application of the Directive 96/71/EC and the Amending Directive (EU) 2018/957, (Directive (EU) 2018/957 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 June 2018 amending Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services as well as the implementation of the Enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU, (Directive 2014/67/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and amending Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (‘the IMI Regulation’)
The specific objectives of this call are the following:
a) To promote transnational cooperation among public authorities and stakeholders, including the promotion of the use of IMI and sharing experiences and good practices in this respect;
b) To increase the accessibility, transparency and quality of the information concerning the terms and conditions of employment to be respected and the existing practices in the Member States to monitor and enforce the provisions of the Posting of Workers Directive;
c) To promote the evidence basis through the collection and evaluation of original data, and the analysis specific to the posting process and posted workers' working conditions, including through the collaboration between universities across various disciplines, research centres and institutes and stakeholders, in particular social partners.
Scope:
Themes and priorities (scope)
The call intends to support the Commission and the Member States to understand existing and new challenges and develop initiatives in the field of posting of workers and a decent work agenda. The proper functioning of administrative cooperation between Member States and improved access to information on applicable terms and conditions of employment and administrative requirements for companies in a transparent and accessible manner, are essential for the correct application, implementation and enforcement of the Directives.
In order to achieve the objective, it is intended with this call for proposals to fund transnational cooperation initiatives aiming at developing autonomous and concrete initiatives by the relevant stakeholders involved in the context of posting with a significant and lasting impact on workers, companies and administrations.
Activities that can be funded (scope)
The following activities may be co-financed:
a) Cooperation: developing new or improving existing exchanges, peer reviews and/or training programmes (for example joint visits, joint inspections, short training actions) between officials of competent public authorities and/or between relevant social partners and stakeholders in the contexts of monitoring the compliance with and enforcement of the applicable rules in relation to posted workers, and/or of administrative cooperation and mutual assistance, including the use of the Internal Market Information System (IMI).
b) Information: developing and improving different information and/or advisory forms and formats for the collection and dissemination of quality, user-friendly, and specific information targeted at workers and/or undertakings with respect to the working conditions applicable to posted workers, the procedures and conditions to be respected by undertakings in different Member States, and other relevant information for the posting of workers in the context of the provision of cross-border services.
c) Evidence: development of joint research projects on different dimensions of the posting of workers in the context of the transnational provision of services and dissemination of results through targeted publication strategies, both in the scientific domain as well as in the specialised and general press.
The three type of actions are mutually exclusive. Applications should focus on one of the above-mentioned three strands in their proposal. Applicants are required to align their proposed actions with activities on administrative cooperation in the field of posting necessary for social security coordination under the Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 987/2009 in order to avoid overlaps with activities in this field. Any such activities should be indicated in the application."

Objectives (expected outcome)
The main objective of this call for proposals is to complement and add value to the activities indicated in the work programme 2021-2022 of the European Platform tackling undeclared work, which reflects the realities of tackling undeclared work in a difficult economic context. The 2021-2022 work programme aims to deepen understanding of (new) types of undeclared work and sectors particularly exposed (e.g. in relation to the collaborative economy, seasonal work, personal and household services as well as HORECA) whilst supporting partnerships, innovation and capacity building, as well as increasing public awareness of undeclared work. The transition of the Platform to the European Labour Authority (ELA) as a permanent working group by latest 1 August 2021 will provide new opportunities to address these challenges in a more integrated and comprehensive way.
The call for proposals will support relevant actors in the field of tackling undeclared work such as ministries, enforcement authorities, social partners, etc. to develop innovative initiatives which shall contribute to enhancing the implementation, application, knowledge and better enforcement of EU and national law in the area of undeclared work, including through cross-border cooperation, thus supporting the transformation of undeclared work into declared work. The knowledge gained from these projects should also help building up evidence-based knowledge for better policy design.
The expected results are the improved transnational cooperation between Member States' different authorities to prevent and deter undeclared work, increased mutual trust among the stakeholders and the increased public awareness on the urgency of action and encouraging Member States to step up their efforts in dealing with undeclared work.
Scope:
Themes and priorities (scope)
The priority for this call is to co-finance actions fostering joint activities and cross-border projects of enforcement authorities and other relevant players improving their technical capacity in the field of preventing and deterrence of undeclared work in line with the Platform’s vision of transforming undeclared into declared work by using a holistic approach, where national governments join up strategy and operations and cooperate with social partners and other stakeholders to employ the full range of direct and indirect policy measures. This will further enhance on-going cooperation between Member States enforcement authorities.
Cooperation may cover the following areas:
Common training courses for staff involved in enforcement activities;
Joint actions and exchange of staff of enforcement authorities;
Provision of technical assistance and/or support to implementation of measures/practice as identified by the European Platform tackling UDW.
Setting up information exchange systems;
Collaborative work in form of sharing of information and mutual learning between enforcement authorities.
Developing information products and services for employers and workers and raising awareness about the benefits of transforming undeclared into declared work.
Activities that can be funded (scope)
The types of activities which can be funded under this call for proposals must address at least one of the areas of action identified below:
Common training courses for staff involved in enforcement activities: developing new or improving existing training programmes between officials of competent public authorities and/or between relevant social partners and stakeholders in the context of contributing to enhancing the implementation, application, knowledge and better enforcement of EU and national law in the area of undeclared work. Activities can include trainings focusing on common themes and challenges (e.g. how to address bogus self-employment) and how they are tackled by different national authorities, exchanges in the field (e.g. agriculture and construction sectors) or trainings focusing on how to foster cooperation/improve working relations between different national and other EU/EEA enforcement agencies. Activities supported should produce an output; a potential output of this type of activities could be a handbook of best enforcement practices used my member states to tackle undeclared work.
Joint inspections and exchange of staff of enforcement authorities: developing new or improving existing exchanges and peer learning between officials of competent public authorities in order to better cooperate across borders, and to develop tools that facilitate the work and to support capacity building. Activities can include: study visits to the authorities of the Member States, including a presentation of their coordinating work between agencies in addressing undeclared work at national level, field exchanges – exchange of staff for a limited period of time to enable exchange of information/best practices etc.
Provision of technical assistance to other EU/EEA enforcement bodies to contribute to capacity building, implementation of good practices, etc.
Information exchange systems: developing cross-border information exchange systems with the aim to facilitate administrative cooperation between enforcement bodies. Cross-border information exchange systems supported under this priority must add value to existing practices such as EESSI, IMI module on posting of workers, etc.).
Collaborative work in form of sharing of information and mutual learning between enforcement authorities: developing or upgrading online platforms for the collection and dissemination of quality, user-friendly, and specific information targeted at tackling undeclared work and facilitating the transition from undeclared work to formal work.
Joint awareness raising campaigns/sector specific campaigns/regional cross-border campaigns: awareness raising campaigns targeted at workers and/or employers should aim at changing norms, values and beliefs regarding the acceptability of participating in undeclared work, so that these are in conformity with laws and regulations, at informing on risks and costs of undeclared work, at promoting the benefits of formalising work, at encouraging a culture of commitment to declaration, informing about the prevention services available to employers/workers, etc. Messages can be conveyed through many different channels, such as mass media (television, radio), social media (using new media channels to spread messages – for e.g. social networks, videos, blogs, twitter, vlogs etc.), public relations, events, talks, demonstrations, tours, posters and leaflets.
Apart from the pure technical implementation of the proposals another deliverable of projects under this call for proposals is the capacity to spell out success and failure factors and parameters in an analytical evidence-based way.
Technical implementation
This includes facilitating and promoting training, good practice initiatives and innovative approaches, such as exchanges of staff and joint activities; exchange of information, mutual learning and awareness raising campaigns. Information exchange systems could be addressed through the joint establishment of protocols, agreements and the development of IT-based systems.
b. Analytical elements
In addition to implementing the activities described above, another deliverable of projects under this call for proposals is the capacity to spell out success and failure factors and parameters. These should be documented in the form of findings and conclusions deriving from a thorough evaluation of the actions undertaken. The evaluation shall help the beneficiaries to draw lessons learned and to establish, deriving from this experience, building blocks for a successful and sustainable cooperation between enforcement authorities and to contribute to the work of the European Platform. The proposal should detail how this output will be achieved."

Background and policy context
The European Cancer Information System (ECIS) managed by the Joint Research Centre provides the latest information on indicators that quantify cancer burden across Europe. It permits the exploration of geographical patterns and temporal trends of incidence, mortality and survival data across Europe for the major cancer entities. The survival rate for cervical, breast and colorectal cancer is a key indicator of how effective healthcare systems are in cancer care, reflecting both efficiency in early detection and the effectiveness of treatment. There is a need to further develop the ECIS to enable the monitoring and assessment of cancer screening programmes, which will require the collection of the relevant data from those entities in the Member States responsible for cancer screening.
This action supports the implementation of a Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan flagship initiative and links with the European Health Data Space and implements the EU4Health Programme’s general objective of improving and fostering health in the Union (Article 3, point (a)) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (a), (f) and (i) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.
Objectives pursued
This action supports the linking of data provided by the cancer screening programmes into ECIS with a view to allowing the permanent monitoring of the screening programmes, including the performance indicators.
The action will consist in the collection of data from entities in the Member States that are responsible for collecting data on cancer screening, in order to provide this data to ECIS, and develop a piloting of the new ECIS functionality as well as a new separate section to ensure a permanent collection and monitoring of the coverage and performance indicators of population-based cancer screening across the Union.
Scope:
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
1. Preparatory work through meetings (5) and workshops (5) to create a platform in which data and indicators on population-based cancer screening programmes are collected, collated and further assessed under the European Cancer Information System.
2. Actions to support the first piloting of the platform developed under point 1, including collection of available datasets related to breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening programmes.
Expected Impact:
Expected results and impact
The expected result is the collection of the relevant cancer screening data from the Member States.
This action aims at improving the monitoring of the implementation of cancer screening programmes across the Union, and will have an impact on the implementation of such programmes by providing the Member States with evidence-based information to strengthen their programmes.

Following the integration and federation of IoT with Big Data and Cloud, which has been explored in past coordinated calls, a remaining challenge to address is enhanced security and privacy and how the human user deals with the ever-increasing amount of sensors, smart objects and data. Both EU and Japan have excellent competences in the fields of cybersecurity systems and visualisation technologies. Especially, security aspects are of increasing importance in these years. There is a need for simple, efficient and trustable systems based on advanced technologies combining Security, Cloud and IoT/Big Data technologies that can provide intelligent detection and countermeasures for device malware attacks, automatic vulnerability discovery and patching, analytics and IoT/Big Data applications. All of these require advanced cloud and edge computing technologies and interoperable IoT devices and platforms.
These new requirements, including security aspects, will have an enormous impact on the underlying cloud/IoT platforms and associated services, especially for cross-border demonstrations of technologies and applications.
Furthermore, interoperability of IoT devices/platforms is of particular interest in the context of Smart Cities (the areas of energy, social infrastructure, traffic/transport, healthcare, and disaster/crime prevention) in order to promote collaboration between a variety of business operators and platforms connecting to various IoT devices, open source, standards, SDKs, common APIs, are the cornerstone of the EU-Japan collaboration.
Scope:
The proposals should address one of the two following areas:
1) Advanced technologies combining Security, IoT, Cloud and Big data for a hyper-connected society
The focus is to research, develop and test advanced technologies combining Security, IoT, Cloud and Big data. The following technologies are expected for research and development: agility against emerging threats; automatic vulnerability discovery and patching; open-sourcing of security tools; IoT security; cloud security; data security; privacy protection; data anonymization; blockchain in the context of IoT/Cloud; critical information infrastructure protection, cross border application demonstrations; etc.
2) Interoperable technologies of IoT devices/platforms in the context of Smart Cities
The focus is to research, develop and test interoperable technologies of IoT devices/platforms in the context of Smart Cities. The following technologies are expected for research and development: edge/fog/cloud computing; low power; scalability; open-standards-based platforms; system and reference architectures; open application programming interfaces (API); data sharing among cross-market/cultural platforms; managing distributed data among different communities and regions; bridging different standardizations; technical verification; cross border application demonstrations; energy management; transportation systems; maintenance systems for life infrastructure; etc. A further objective is to contribute to standardization activities under the cooperation of EU-JP research institutes and IoT-related consortia (e.g. the Alliance for IoT Innovation (AIOTI) and IoT Acceleration Consortium), and promote a global expansion of research results in Smart Cities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately by one project of EUR 1.5 million in each of the suggested areas. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Credible demonstrations based on cross-border business and/or societal applications of robust interoperable technologies identifying policy/legal obstacles (i.e., free flow of data, data protection, data portability etc.).
Concrete implementations of interoperable solutions that integrate IoT, Cloud and Big Data including security that are candidates for standardisation.
Facilitation of the development of cloud-enabled, secure and trustworthy IoT/big data applications (i.e., integrating intelligent security systems and visualisation technologies and devices/interfaces).
Promotion of the use of data related to Smart Cities and the creation of new increasingly efficient services in urban and regional administrative management.

Over the last years, the Internet of Things has moved from being a futuristic vision to an increasing market reality. The Integration and federation of IoT with Big Data and Cloud (including edge cloud), having all three diverging principles, remains a key challenge. The exploitation of big data, being obtained from remote sensing / actuation and the Web and social media crawling in specific contexts and being processed by smart objects and in sophisticated clouds, enables the creation of distributed intelligence as key application/service drivers toward attractive IoT services. Cloud-based applications driven by decentralised information processing capabilities need to use dedicated cloud architectures, standardised APIs, open software components, and to pay special attention to data integrity, localisation, and confidentiality. Holistic approaches are required to address privacy & security issues across value chains including privacy by design aspects, SLAs, software algorithms and new data management models.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
The scope is to realise IoT/Cloud/Big Data platforms in social application contexts. Specific requirements include multiple sensors and devices linked with big data analytics and cloud data management, edge-heavy computing, machine learning and complex event discovery, and a programmable IoT logic and IoT Data Warehouse. The research will address technological issues in big data application scenarios such as: elasticity and scalability of cloud data management; transregional federated clouds; distributed storage; distributed and/or edge computing; wireless sensor networks; cross-sectoral and spatio-temporal data analysis; etc. Applications related in particular to smart cities supporting urban needs and green manufacturing should serve as test-bed and verification areas.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The next phase of 5G activities running during the 2018-20 period covers both in EU and in Japan, technologies and systems demonstrations and trials. The challenge is hence to demonstrate technologies and system interoperability for 5G applications of interest in the two regions in early version of the IMT-2020 standards, but also to go further to address long-term challenges beyond 5G.
The overall goal is to evaluate in real setup innovative end-to-end 5G systems built on the outcomes of previous phases of the 5G R&I. The optimisation of the frequency bands and their usage with different coverage requirements as well as the validation of geographic interoperability are key targets.
Scope:
The proposals should address one of the two following areas:
1) Large-scale demonstrations and trials towards 5G applications: The objective is to research, develop and test technologies to enable applications developers and researchers to take advantage of the 5G integrated access/core network infrastructures and testbeds in Europe and Japan, in order to showcase the adaptability of the latest 5G systems, technologies and early version of the IMT-2020 standards.
The area of large-scale demonstrations and trials towards 5G applications, should showcase the adaptability of the 5G infrastructure to the 5G KPI's and the use of the integrated environment to contribute to global R&D and standardization efforts of 5G systems by having an open environment for the trials.
The focus should be on trials and demonstrations of 5G applications in the use cases of Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Broadband Access in Dense Areas. Typical applications scenarios could cover, but are not limited to, mobile 3D immersive experience, ultra high definition live video and HD video sharing in crowded environments. Typical test/demonstration environments will include high user density shopping malls, stadiums and open crowded streets.
To try out highly innovative solutions targeting new opportunities which will emerge with the worldwide deployment of 5G ecosystems, the participation of industry from both regions, and particularly SMEs, is key.
2) Joint research on enabling technologies for beyond 5G: 5G mobile technology is expected to handle a fully mobile and connected society. The demands for this are characterized by the tremendous growth in connectivity and data traffic density/volume as well as the required multi-layer densification to enable this. Beyond 5G should further support such trend.
Focus should be towards the enormous capacities foreseen to be needed in the backhaul and fronthaul networks to carry the traffic, as fibre-optic networks, may not be an option everywhere. A viable alternative in such cases is to use radio-based backhaul/fronthaul links in the millimeter or sub-millimeter wave bands to support super high rate applications, > 100 Gb/s, and targeting use new of very high frequency, notably spectrum > 275 GHz.
The goal is for an alternative transmission system occupying bandwidths as large as several tens of GHz to allow the realization of such high data rates with less complexity in the baseband.
Communication system and networks using both of advanced optical/photonic technologies and radio technologies should be expected for Beyond 5G.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 1.5 million would allow each area to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Large-scale joint demonstrators converging towards open 5G applications.
Global interoperability demonstrations for 5G networks.
Support of common standardisation roadmaps for 5G starting with 3GPP Release14, including coordinated and common standards in the SDN/NFV domain. Standardization impact through EU and Japanese research efforts are addressed through H2020 as well as 5GPF (5G Promotion Forum) and should also be relevant in the context of the 5G spectrum process for WRC-19
Joint contributions to global 5G specifications for IMT-2020 in relevant organisations (e.g. 3GPP, ITU-R), especially in view of 5G phase 2 standardisation (beyond eMBB) and spectrum harmonization for IMT-2020.
Open new prospects for wireless technologies in terms of applications and use of novel spectrum.

Recent Internet multimedia applications are characterized by an increasing trend in the number of users creating, storing, sharing and consuming a larger number of bigger content. With the introduction of new types of content (higher quality, richer content, networked media …), Future Internet applications and services will be more and more demanding on the underlying infrastructures.
To accommodate Future Internet applications/services, national projects in United States such as Named Data Networking (NDN) and eXpressive Internet Architecture (XIA) have been focusing on content-centric or content-oriented networking by academia. Japan and Europe have also for the last years conducted very close and complementing research and developments on information-centric networking and efficient media distribution technologies driven by industry and academia consortium. Yet, there are still unsolved issues, especially when facing current and future worldwide end-to-end use cases.
Global experimentation, with close to reality setup and constraints, is required to be able to identify and reproduce known or unknown limitations and problems; and to test and validate new solutions (protocols, architectures, …) from the network layer up to the application layer.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
The overall objective is to develop frameworks, architectures, protocols or tools for efficient media and content distribution on content-centric networking and enable the experimentation by building a large scale global Information-Centric Networking (ICN) testbed. The proposals must cover joint work on connecting and federating key existing ICN and related testbeds in Europe and Japan, or other regions, building upon previous research results, tools and framework (e.g. CUTEi, Fed4Fire, Contrace, Testman, Felix, Green-ICN …). The proposals must be based on strong cooperation between academia and industry, in order to clearly demonstrate mutual interests for future Internet services. When appropriate, enhancement of recent developments of existing ICN architectures (e.g. outcomes of the NDN or XIA projects) can be considered. A dedicated attention should be put on the experimenters experience and interaction. The proposals should also contribute to the definition of open standards and common APIs (Application Programming Interface) to ensure world-scale interoperability in the domain.

Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or duration.
Expected Impact:
Enabling global scale experimentation, with very large testing capacities (content type/amount/number of sources/consumers …) for the distribution and management of networked media, rich and large contents requesting high to very high data rate communication among a large number of consumers.

Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
Two aspects that are complementing each other are in scope:
5G technologies and systems to realize high-performance heterogeneous networks which have dynamic resource allocation capabilities, superior spectral efficiency performances and functions of supporting a very wide range of application requirements. The work focuses on interoperability across heterogeneous networking implementation, on the basis of agreement on the overall testing and evaluation methodologies and the identification of related evaluation criteria and parameters and usage scenarios. This work is expected to visibly contribute to the overall evaluation methodology of 5G technologies carried out by 3GPP. It includes both below and above 6GHz relevant frequency bands in the context of global interoperability scenarios.
5G network to control heavy dynamicity, which change traffic volume and characteristic as well as traffic growth, with agile and flexible control or management scheme such as SDN/NFV. The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies with networks controlled by software, automatically is targeted for advancing networks, as well as the Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) to virtualize entire classes of network node functions into building blocks that may be connected, or chained, together to create telecommunication services. They draw out the performance of 5G and are essential to manage the networks in the near future. The work focuses on the earliest networks by SDN and NFV in the world, on the overall testing and evaluation SDN network management and the result of related evaluation will contribute to to relevant standardisation (i.e. ONF, ITU, 3GPP). This work is expected to visibly contribute to the overall evaluation methodology of 5G technologies carried out by 3GPP.
Sharing the results in common testbeds and applications may be targeted, and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics may be considered as a deployment scenario of 5G networks or technologies.
A strong focus should be given towards a common standardization roadmap for 5G which may start with 3GPP R14, including coordinated and common standards in the SDN/NFV domain.

Specific challenge:The monitoring of real energy use in energy-efficient buildings frequently shows major differences with respect to the predicted performance. This is even worse if a set of interacting buildings is considered. It is therefore important to capture the real complexities of the energy performance of the actual buildings and districts. In addition, effective methodologies for the correct understanding of user behaviour need to be addressed.
Scope: At building level, the research focus is on developing methodologies and tools to monitor and assess actual building energy performance, considering relevant factors such as user behaviour, complex energy systems performance and weather forecast, and to be able to predict accurately building energy loads and consumption along the whole lifecycle. The new methods and tools could include energy performance diagnostics for predictive maintenance (related to different construction typologies and their thermal behaviour), to provide the accuracy required to properly value retrofit technologies and support decision making during the different stages in the life of the buildings. The effective monitoring and management of energy flows to reduce energy consumption and to ensure that the building is operated in a way that meets design intent should also be addressed. Common indicators, measuring technologies and data analysis methods should be developed to monitor building performance during operation.
A holistic “open” approach to building control and monitoring systems is required, integrating any possible existing control and monitoring infrastructure. The commissioning, sign-off and maintenance phase should be addressed. High quality, reliable and non-intrusive (including wireless) data acquisition methodologies are also needed. A positive impact on health and safety (e.g. hygienic aspects of ventilation or DHW systems) as well as comfort is an aspect to consider.
At the level of a block of buildings, the focus will be on real time optimisation of energy demand and supply using intelligent energy management systems with the objective of reducing the difference between peak power demand and minimum night time demand.
Cost-effective and interoperable solutions should be demonstrated for a block of buildings consisting of at least 3 different buildings in real life operating conditions. Autonomous power systems at district level could be considered.
The role of players such as ESCOs, facility managers and third parties to certify performances should be considered in line with future requirements for energy performance contracts and rating of buildings with a life cycle perspective.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Significant reduction in the difference between real and predicted energy behaviour in a building or a block of buildings, after the demonstration of the viability of the new tools and methods for measuring and analysing real building energy performance.
                   The gap is narrowed down to a value consistent with energy performance contracts.
                   Provide solutions with a high replication potential.

Specific challenge:Europe is facing the challenge of deep rehabilitation of residential buildings (including buildings of historic value) while lowering the costs of refurbishment. Nowadays at the scale of Europe, fossil energy is mainly used in residential buildings for two usages which are space heating and Domestic Hot Water production. Such a large building stock needs innovative, efficient and cost-effective retrofitting solutions to meet the planned net-zero energy standards. Moreover, due to the current economic crisis investment capability in building retrofitting is limited and public incentives tend to decrease. Breakthrough solutions are, therefore, needed which combine affordability along the whole life cycle, reduced maintenance and higher performance reliability with reduced energy use.
Scope: Systemic approaches need to be developed which integrate the most promising cost-effective technologies and materials. The solutions could include, for example, energy use through innovative heat pump systems; combination of renewable energy sources at building level; exploitation of heat recovery for water and air as well as ICT, enabling to adapt the system to the end-user behaviour without losing control of the global efficiency of the system.
In combination and synergy with the efforts addressing envelope improvements to reduce drastically the buildings heat needs, a systemic approach related to space heating and Domestic Hot Water (DHW) needs to be developed, having in mind that in the coming years DHW is going to be the first thermal need in residential buildings. The risk of overheating should be also analysed together with the whole renovation solution.
The district scale, as well as the interactions between the buildings and the thermal and electrical energy networks (i.e. impact on the energy demand) should be taken into account. Innovative solutions with a high degree of flexibility with regard to the grid are required by realising the full potential of ICT and control system solutions. The integration of (compact) thermal energy storage should play a pivotal role as moving the demand from peak periods to other ones or yielding the full potential of renewable. The approach should be based on a methodology incorporating modelling, simulation, virtual reality, with the aim of identifying the optimal cost-effective solutions. Standardisation issues to facilitate integration of system components should be addressed.
Energy efficiency should be addressed by proper system integration and installation, e.g. through synergy between technologies which have already been proven at a small scale and need a larger scale demonstration.
Financial models should be validated too, in order to ensure the feasibility of the replication of deep energy efficiency rehabilitation of residential buildings in Europe, where the current economic crisis originates important socio-economic barriers.
A high replication potential is necessary while taking into account the supply chain issues. At least two demonstration sites should be considered in two different climatic conditions in order to ensure that the technologies are as widely applicable as possible. The impact at district level should be taken into account when defining the overall approach and should be reflected in the selection of the demonstrators.
In addition, to ensure appropriateness of business models, the participation of building owners (private or public organisations) is recommended. User involvement in renovation processes will require special attention, in particular when a deep retrofitting is required. Social and behavioural aspects are critical factors for project success. In parallel, new low intrusive techniques and the utilization of tools and technologies that speed up construction processes with high quality standards are welcome.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Demonstrate innovative retrofitting solutions as real cases approaching net zero energy standards.
                Reduction of at least 60% in energy consumption compared to the values before renovation while ensuring affordability.
                Demonstrate a high replicability potential.
                Return on investment should be below 7 years in the case of deep retrofitting.
                Advent of a new generation of skilled workers and SME contractors in the construction sector aware of the need of a systemic approach towards energy efficiency should be promoted through the proposed activities.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to develop a scalable, reliable and cost-effective early warning system prototype to forecast and monitor vector-borne diseases in order to contribute to the prevention of outbreaks mitigating their impact on local, regional and global scales and providing support to existing elimination efforts.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), vector-borne diseases such as malaria, Zika, dengue or yellow fever cause more than 1 million deaths globally each year. Vectors are living organisms that can transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans. Vector-borne diseases are a global threat to public health and can have far-reaching economic and social impacts.
Climate and environmental phenomena contribute to creating the necessary conditions for these kinds of diseases to thrive. Variables such as rainfall, temperature and humidity affect the number and survival rate of mosquitoes and other vectors of diseases.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in the context of its Sustainable Development Goal 3 ""Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"", aims to end the epidemics of malaria and neglected tropical diseases (amongst others) by 2030. It calls for strengthening the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks.
The Earth Observation domain is changing with increasing amounts of data being generated from space-borne, air-borne, in-situ and citizen observatories. Effective management of big data in this domain shall be an essential element in improving the 'early warning' capabilities of any system which aims to mitigate epidemics related to vector-borne diseases. The full potential of combining all the available data is not yet harnessed and innovative solutions are needed to enable the system's wider use and exploitation in this context. Such solutions would not only help to improve the 'preparedness' and response related to vector-borne disease outbreaks, but also foster the creation of a digital solution marketplace in the domain of environmental and climate health risks.
The specific rules of the contest are published in the H2020 Participant Portal by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.
Expected Impact:
A reliable, cost-effective and scalable early warning system prototype to forecast and monitor vector-borne diseases, which should encompass innovative technological solutions integrating big data derived from different sources (e.g. space-borne, airborne, in-situ and citizen observations) in Earth observation domain, including climate data, vector-related modelling, meteorology, and geo-located information related to vector borne disease outbreaks and behaviour. These should be interoperable with public health data and other socio-economic data.
Demonstration of the prototype at local level, taking into account any relevant societal factors in the chosen geographical area. It should be compatible for use with data coming from existing multi-disciplinary networks comprising health, humanitarian aid and emergency management actors, in order to leverage data and information from these networks, as well as to showcase the operational potential and added value of the solution.

Specific challenge:The development of sustainable solutions for refurbishment of buildings and their proper integration at district level requires major innovations in the design tools, construction methods and management practices, including socio-economic aspects and innovative financing instruments.
Buildings should no longer be renovated individually, but as part of a global energy system, where their interactions with their environment can be predicted and simulated, as well as taking into account interactions with inhabitants and customers. Design tools should also support the evaluation of different retrofitting alternatives.
A challenge is to ensure the interoperability between tools from various domains and at different scales. But more importantly, knowledge collection and management in the fields of refurbishment issues should be developed and implemented in order to propose solutions adapted to collaborative multi-disciplinary refurbishing work.
Scope: Research activities should be focused on design at buildings and district level, taking into account the adjacent systems such as district heating/cooling and decentralised thermal energy generation and other interactions with the neighbourhood, giving priority to local renewable resources. Projects should promote and set up an integrated approach in support of innovation, by providing actors with holistic methods and tools. Energy efficiency technologies should become elements of design databases that allow stakeholder to select the most suitable approach for performance improving, taking full advantage of geo-clustered data sets. The design phases linked to the retrofitting of existing buildings taking into account subsequent operation and maintenance will be considered as priority. In this respect, there is a need for further research on operational information that can be used in design models. Knowledge based design can also be used to provide input into management systems.
Projects should also cover validation actions on a technical level, which apply the tools on refurbishment projects; and on a societal level, i.e. validation with the occupants of the building. For the latter, involvement of organisations within an Integrated Project Delivery Approach, supporting a participatory design approach, could be an asset.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding.

Specific challenge:Storage plays a pivotal role in synchronising energy demand and supply, both on a short and long term (seasonal) basis. Transformation of our existing building stock towards very low energy buildings and nearly zero energy and Plus-energy buildings requires effective integration and full use of the potential yield of renewable energy.  Thermal storage is a key priority to make such a step, particularly considering the energy renovation of the existing stock, where compact building level solutions are required.
Scope:Proposals should address advanced solutions required to reduce thermal losses, reduce pressure drops, and improve heat exchange in and between storage material and heat carrier. Having in mind a system approach, innovations are required at different levels. High energy density storage materials are needed in terms of long term multi-cyclic stability at tuneable temperature levels. These advanced energy storage materials should allow regeneration temperatures in a range below 100oC to enable a higher efficiency and effectiveness of thermal energy storage of at least 6 times the energy storage density of water. Furthermore, an additional innovation may concern storage reactor components, in particular the heat exchanger. With respect to the entire storage system, advanced energy management is needed, including smart algorithms for (dis)charging at different temperatures, and simple and robust control equipment. These storage solutions should be enabled by material innovations that are safe and environmentally friendly.
Small scale demonstration of the technical (with compactness as a crucial boundary condition) and economic feasibility of such storage systems at the level of components and systems in relation to space heating and cooling and/or domestic hot water systems of a single building are expected, validating a systemic approach in system integration and scalability in near real life operating conditions.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.

                Provide advanced thermal energy storage solutions.
                Demonstrate solutions that have a stable long term performance in multi-cyclic seasonal use of at least 20 years.
                Validate in the case of pumpable energy storage materials, an energy density comparable to the best solid-gas systems.
                Deliver compact systems with the potential to fit in the limited space available in a single building in the existing housing stock. The storage material volume per dwelling should not exceed 2.5 m3.
                Solutions should demonstrate a potential to reduce the net energy consumption of a building by at least 15% and a have return-on-investment period below 10 years.

Specific challenge:Today's availability of better energy-efficient building components (envelopes, windows, equipment, etc…) demands calls for ensuring that these benefits will not be lost through lack of knowledge or bad implementation during the construction processes which may affect the final performance of the building. Critical components to energy efficiency have indeed proven to have significant impact for buildings. With today's high energy prices, a proper understanding of critical components to energy efficiency is crucial in terms of savings and comfort. In addition, the construction sector is characterised by a segmented approach involving a variety of skills and expertise with different role and responsibility. During construction, each actor of the construction value chain must ensure that its contribution fits into a quality framework defined collectively at the design level. Self-inspection and quality checks are implemented to guarantee the final thermal, acoustic and energy performance of the building which will be quantified during commissioning. This means that quality control is of utmost importance to guarantee that the energy performance at commissioning stage will meet the one expected at design stage.
Scope: The research focus is on new self-inspection techniques and quality check measures for efficient construction processes enabled by portable and robust systems that can be easily handled in the construction site. In particular methods for energy related self-inspection, for example to avoid the presence of thermal bridges or to ensure and control good air-tightness in low energy or passive buildings should be considered. The possibility to measure U values over large areas with non-contact solutions would allow  assessing the conformity to design during refurbishment. The techniques to be developed should also be able to avoid or reduce economic and time deviations of the construction processes.
The solutions proposed should preferably be cost-effective and easy to use, considering that they will be implemented on-site by workers which are not necessarily highly skilled. The solutions should be validated in a relevant construction environment.
Execution details brought to the construction site are of paramount importance to improve the overall quality. These execution details need to take into account the specificities of the building project but also the installation rules defined by building component manufacturers in order to avoid any misinterpretation on the construction site and therefore to contribute to bridging the gap between design and construction. The research should consider some peculiarities of working environments in the construction sector, such as geographical dispersion and heterogeneity of subcontractors.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4-6. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

                To provide guidelines, methodologies for workers and contribute to standardisation activities.

Moreover, EU transport GHG emission reduction targets for 2030 along with policies that aim at boosting inter-modality underline the urgency of introducing ultra-low and zero-emission solutions for shipping. There is an increasing trend to electrify ships using diesel-electric propulsion systems. Such systems offer the possibility to incorporate a range of fuels, energy management systems and batteries to provide peak power shaving for the main engines to reduce GHG emissions and improve efficiency. Fossil based Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) can also be deployed as a commercially available solution to reduce air pollutants (SOx, NOx, PM), but it is less effective at reducing GHG emissions and would not be able to contribute substantially towards achieving the aforementioned IMO GHG reduction target. Several pure battery-electric ships have also been introduced in recent years, but the amount of battery storage capacity required and the very high electrical demands when charging make such solutions unsuitable for long-distance shipping.

Fuel cell technology using hydrogen or another alternative carbon neutral fuel can enable shipping to achieve a very large reduction (>90%) in both GHG and pollutant emissions. However, so far only several small, low speed vessels have implemented fuel cells (of up to a few hundred kW) for demonstration purposes.

There are several challenges associated with taking larger fuel cells into use in shipping. First, fuel cell systems need to be scaled up to the desired MW scale while simultaneously addressing durability, compatibility with maritime conditions (saline air, shock, rolling & vibration). Second, refuelling facilities and high-volume fuel bunkering systems will be required, particularly for larger vessels and this poses a significant challenge for the less mature fuel options. Moreover, the total propulsion system's energy and power density as well as redundancy should be adequately secured for the specific applications. Third, immature regulations, codes and standards (RCS), apply to hydrogen in particular, but also alternative fuels and FC technologies. The time consuming Alternative Design process may exhibit an unavoidable challenge, as IMO rules are not yet in place. Fourth, market deployment, cost reduction strategies (including maintenance for marine environments) leading to viable business models need to be developed. Last, but not least, the public domain needs to be addressed, ensuring the acceptance of these new propulsion systems.
Scope:
The scope of this topic is to adapt, scale up and demonstrate a fuel cell (FC) system for shipping with a total minimum nominal power output of 2 MW, capable of reducing GHG emissions by at least 70 % (both local and on a well-to-wake basis) and NOX, SOX and particulate matter by at least 80% compared to conventional diesel-based systems for the selected mode(s) of operation. A pathway towards zero-emission operation should also be outlined to ensure compatibility with longer-term IMO objectives. The topic is open to all types of FC technologies and all types of fuels, as long as the new system can meet the expected emissions reduction. The FC system may be used for propulsion and/or auxiliary loads or for port and pilotage operations on ships (e.g., a ferry, freight carrier, cruise ship, passenger boat etc.). Retrofit of a vessel, where the FC system replaces conventional fossil-fuelled engines is also allowed. The ship should be used for commercial services to gain relevant operational experience. The FC system can be built of smaller units (modules) but no lower than 500 kW with a total on board installed power within each vessel of at least 2MW.

The project should address the following key issues:
- Fuel cell system issues:
Adapt and validate the FC module/system for reliable operation under maritime conditions for the selected fuel in line with prevailing technical (i.e., durability, power density) and regulatory (RCS, redundancy etc.) requirements;
Assess how the FC module/system may be further up scaled to 20 MW power systems for larger ships;
Particularly, if other fuels than hydrogen are chosen, maximise system efficiency to achieve a substantial improvement over current maritime combustion engine technology.
- Fuel storage and supply chain:
For the selected fuel, identify the required refuelling facility for the FC-powered ship and the fuel supply arrangements required to meet the stated CO2 emission reduction targets. Consideration should be given to system weight, volume, required time for and operation time between bunkering, energy penalties and implications for larger ship designs (with regards to safety and potential loss of useful space);
Define the fuel supply chain in volumes sufficient for short-range vessels and for long-range ocean-going vessels;
For hydrogen as fuel:
an interim refuelling solution (e.g., containers) in relevant scale for the demonstrations is foreseen and
a study on a bunkering concept with the potential for scaling up (for compatibility with a 20 MW FC system) is required, ensuring minimization of hydrogen loss/leakages/boil-off (if relevant);
For other fuels:
the bunkering solution is considered an integral part of the project.
- System integration and operation:
Define vessel integration requirements and develop adequate maintenance procedures, in line with approval requirements;
Adapt/design the multi-MW fuel cell system/power generating unit to vessel application;
Physical integration of the fuel cell, the fuel system and power management system into the vessel and vessel systems;
Define any additional battery storage systems that may be needed for load levelling.
- Regulatory, economic and societal issues:
Contribute to the establishment and further development of maritime rules and guidelines for selected FC powered vessel design(s) and the alternative fuel to be utilized (i.e. explosion safety levels) in line with class/flag/port approval requirements;
Assess and propose suitable business models, to foster further commercialisation of technical FCH solutions both on board the vessel and bunkering/refuelling;
Quantify the potential for cost reductions as the FC and alternative fuel technologies mature and define the roadmap to get there;
Assess the advantages of using FC systems in combination with the selected alternative fuel option in terms of emission reduction during operation, noise reduction, availability and reliability;
Discuss /share experiences with the shipping industry to contribute to raise awareness of the potential of FC propulsion technology;
Define training requirements for operator and crews.
With regard to the regulatory, economic and societal issues, it is expected that the project will contribute towards the objectives and activities of the Hydrogen Innovation Challenge (as detailed under section 3.2.G.International cooperation). Promoting international collaboration beyond EU Member States and H2020 Associated Countries is therefore strongly encouraged.
The project should closely follow the developments in the IGF Code Correspondence Group at the IMO, works of the European Sustainable Shipping Forum (Sub-group on alternative fuels) and relevant work of the certification bodies. The project should moreover take into account and seek synergies with other ongoing activities such as research projects arising from the 2019 Horizon 2020 topic LC-MG-1-8-2019: Retrofit Solutions and Next Generation Propulsion for Waterborne Transport addressing high power FC passenger ship concept.
The project should include an operational period of at least 12 months (including both winter and summer season) and a minimum of 3,000 operational hours demonstrating the TRL of the FC system and vessel. The ship should be used on a regular basis in order to gain relevant operational experience. Bunkering to sustain the normal operational profile of the vessel(s) is considered within the scope of this topic. Exploitation of synergies with refuelling infrastructure for other applications is considered advantageous. Excess fuel expenses during the demonstration compared to diesel is considered eligible costs.
If the selected fuel is hydrogen, “CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform to ensure that the hydrogen consumption is of renewable nature.
The project consortium should include at least one of each of the following: vessel owners or operators, fuel cell system providers, shipbuilders or shipyards; cooperation with Classification Societies is also encouraged.
The construction of the demonstration vessels' hull, superstructure and other components unrelated to the FC propulsion system, as well as operational costs such as crew are not considered eligible costs.
For the various FC types and fuels (storage and bunkering solution) which are eligible (as described above), the TRL varies widely, so no TRLs at project start and end are included here. The proposals should nevertheless clearly describe the targeted TRL advancements.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 10 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 4 - 6 years.
Expected Impact:
The total minimum of 2 MW FC installed power is expected to be an early stepping-stone towards meeting larger vessels' power requirements of typically 20 MW or more for environmentally sound, safe and reliable operation. It provides a significant step towards the implementation of multi-MW FCs and their zero-emission fuels in shipping as the main energy source. The project should also strengthen the EU supply chain both for FCs and identify the steps that are needed in order to develop sustainable low-emission bunkering solutions for FC powered vessels. If other fuels than hydrogen are chosen, should demonstrate a significant improvement in fuel efficiency over the current state of the art. Additionally, the project should identify viable business models for large vessel applications. It will moreover provide for increased visibility of the potential of FCH technologies as a means for de-carbonising shipping. The demonstration will also provide important empirical evidence to IMO, Classification Societies, Flags Administration and the whole community for the development of underlying regulations, codes and standards, best practices, business cases, and so on.

More specifically, the expected impact include:
Successful demonstration of MW-scale FC system(s), alternative fuel storage, bunkering and refuelling for shipping that, compared to current state of the art diesel engine technology, reduces GHG emissions by >70% and each atmospheric pollutant (NOx, SOx and particulates including ultrafine particulates) by >80% for the selected modes of operation;
Identification of a route for scalability to 20 MW FC power, associated bunkering and system integration for large long-range vessels;
FC Module durability of at least 25,000 h;
Tank to propeller electrical efficiency of >48% (LHV) for relevant operation profile(s);
FC system availability of at least 95 %, and operational strategies for meeting commercial ship requirements for propulsion, auxiliary load or port/pilotage operation;
Technical solutions that meet all local safety requirements concerning refuelling, fuel storage and bunkering within the operational environment;
Systems design life of at least 7 years to fit service intervals between major vessel overhauls (servicing allowed) in line with the typical 25-30 years vessel lifetime;
Provision of empirical evidence and lessons learnt from implementing and operating FC ships and use of alternative fuels, identification of bottlenecks – technical, organisational, structural, financial including RCS and formulation of recommendations on how to address these;
Increased public awareness about zero emission initiatives in the marine segment;
De-risking further commercialisation of FC and alternative fuels technologies;
Contribute to significant further capital cost reduction of fuel cells and refuelling infrastructure.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Fuel cell powered heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) hold great promise for deployment at global scale. However, for HDVs, and more specifically trucks, we face new challenges compared to Light Duty Vehicles (LDVs), especially with respect to durability and robustness. While 6,000 h lifetime is sufficient for LDVs, heavy-duty trucks will require at least five times longer. Therefore, core stack components particularly Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) need to be specifically developed in line with the specific heavy-duty truck requirements, while complying with prevailing cost targets. This improvement of the components is an essential step in order to confirm performance and durability for any full-scale stack and system design.
Increased understanding of degradation phenomena at stack level remains a major challenge to overcome in order to achieve the durability required for HD trucks. Very long lifetime is required along with high autonomy, combined with aggressive road duty cycles for some applications. Technical targets will be to further develop and apply advanced methods to properly investigate degradation of performance and the causes of these losses for the first step and, to identify, develop, realise and validate improved MEA formulations in stacks in a second step. The final outcome should thus allow significantly increased stack lifetime whilst enhancing performance and reducing cost.
Scope:
The global scope is to enable in the short-term (<5 years) the deployment of competitive HD trucks based on EU fuel cell technology. The main objectives will be firstly, to clarify the durability and degradation issues of heavy duty stack components for SoA technologies (to ensure that studies are based on the most relevant up-to-date parameters, components and operating conditions for the selected applications) and, secondly, to propose and validate more durable stacks based on re-designed MEAs.
The project should rate and rank the most critical degradation mechanisms, looking for specific phenomena or stressors in stacks for heavy-duty (HD) trucks. This may be achieved using aged MEA components reflecting actual ageing from real HD operation either by collecting aged samples as well as the corresponding ageing data from field tests or actual trucks when available or mainly by performing ageing tests in labs on short stacks following realistic load profiles (full power, range extender, hybridization cases, or accelerated test), validated regarding actual, in-service drive cycles using HD-specific stack components. Applications data to be considered are: 1,000 km driving range per day; HD vehicles of classes from >12t; with power output from 150 to 350 kW and ranges from 12,000 to 100,000 km/year.
The methodology should include a broad range of investigations, with method development as needed for local in-situ measurements or ex-situ analysis, such as advanced electrochemical, physical, chemical and structural analyses, aiming to relate degradation phenomena to operating modes and conditions, quantify and correlate component degradation to performance losses. The second and major phase should be to use the results from the understanding phase to propose the best-suited mitigation strategies for the degradation mechanisms identified, concentrating the efforts on MEAs and MEA components (materials, formulations, processing), ensuring that the PGM-loading meets the target. Due to the longer lifetime required, the PGM loading target may be higher compared to LDV; hence research on how to achieve on the long term a high power density to PGM loading ratio would be of particular interest. In order to validate the proposed improvements in durability within a restricted timeframe, alternative methodologies should be proposed, such as strategies based on accelerated stress tests.
Modelling could be used to go further in the interpretation, or to simulate ageing for various MEA compositions and help defining the better trends for components formulation and stack operation. Several aspects should be covered by the project to develop disruptive MEAs and MEA components, for example by modifications of the component properties (membranes, ionomer, catalysts, gas diffusion layers) and preferably by looking for more effective utilisation of the MEAs by tuned formulations (optimised interfaces, flow-field-adapted or graded electrodes). A focus on improved durability should be the priority, while maintaining low cost and avoiding negative impact on performance. The assessment of the developments should be conducted following specified relevant protocols in representative full-size single cells and preferably stacks.
A stack performance and durability test protocol recognised by the OEMs and in-line with EU standardisation activities (in collaboration with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) testing harmonization activities) should be applied (including minimum duration required). This validation should be done at a representative scale, at least in a short-stack of minimum 10 cells or 1 kW, with a statistically significant number of MEAs, and an MEA active area of at least 150 cm², preferably conforming with the full-power stack design. The impact on system cost over the lifetime should be assessed based on these final validation results.
The project should build on the results of previous supported projects [23] dedicated to relevant applications such as GiantLeap (addressing advanced online diagnostic, prognostic and control systems), ID FAST (addressing investigation of ageing causes and AST methodology applied on LDV), Revive (developing garbage trucks) or H2HAUL (developing FC heavy duty trucks) as well as national actions, in order to get relevant data on FC operation and degradation or aged components as starting points.
Consortia should prove their access to SoA stack designs and include the capability to assemble stacks, by involving at least two stack providers. The hardware should be available for the implementation and the test of both performance and durability of reference and developed MEAs. Project consortia should include the capability to manufacture MEAs at the SoA level to ensure correct implementation and assessment of improvements of MEA materials or components.
TRL at start of the project: 2 and TRL at the end of the project: 4.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
[23] https://www.fch.europa.eu/page/fch-ju-projects
Expected Impact:
The final outcome should validate the solutions developed showing clear added-value in stack durability whilst maintaining the initial performance at least as high as that achieved by the selected reference (to be defined at the beginning of the project and consistent with the current SoA, to avoid artificial improvements by using a weak starting point).
Other expected impacts should include:
Durable cost-effective performing technical solutions for PEMFC stacks’ core components allowing to support the future implementation of European technologies in HDV systems;
Recommendations at system level, including hybridization as appropriate, for an optimized management of the full power chain allowing to improve FC durability consistently with the targeted KPIs;
Contribution to the targets set by the Multi-Annual Work Plan and its addendum for 2024 [24] on LDVs, particularly on stack power density (increase in kW/kg and kW/L vs. SoA) and indirectly on PEMFC system cost through stack components (reduction in €/kW vs. SoA) for heavy duty transport applications;
Technological solutions whose economic and environmental aspects can be easily transferred to other fields compared to HDV, such as other transport or stationary applications;
Possible contribution to RCS with regards to fuel cell testing and durability assessment.

In particular, the main targeted KPIs to be considered for the investigations are the following:
Power density > 1.2 W/cm² at 0,675 V/cell;
PGM loading < 0.3 g/kW;
System durability: 30,000 projected hours with less than 10% performance loss at nominal power.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Currently, most fuel cell systems and their key components are produced in small quantities, often with considerable manual input and not optimized for low cycle times implying the corresponding high production cost and quality deficits. The core components are currently niche products with high complexity to produce and industry has little at-scale manufacturing experience. In order to achieve cost levels allowing for market deployment, fuel cell systems need further significant cost reductions in several areas including development, manufacturing, tooling and assembling. However, today, low production volumes – sometimes on a prototype level – do not provide the economical drive for the identification, improvement and validation of all factors that influence the robustness and yield of the manufacturing processes at system level.
Scope:
This topic addresses process development of critical steps of PEMFC system manufacturing, including the production of component engineering samples. The fuel cell stack and stack component manufacturing is explicitly excluded from this topic since it is addressed in topic FCH-01.1-2016. The overall process chain must be considered for sake of the analysis of cycle time, covering the complete value chain including the development of inline non-destructive control tools in order to reduce the amount of defected components. Potential project proposals should have the main focus on the development of manufacturing technologies specific to PEMFC system and system components for transport applications. Demonstrations of full pilot lines are excluded.
The scope of this topic is to enable established PEMFC OEMs and component suppliers in the fuel cell industry to implement technologies enabling the step-up from small scale production towards higher volumes (50,000 systems/year in 2020) which will result in the reduced cost of PEMFC technologies. The topic should also develop simpler tooling/ manufacturing technologies, making it easier for other players to enter the PEMFC system component industry, thus expanding and making the component supplier base more robust and competitive.
The scope of this topic is, moreover, to focus on improving the system production processes with respect to cost, cycle time and quality. Proposals should focus on developing high volume manufacturing technologies, modifying system components for improved manufacturability as well as quality assurance. System components such as compressors, heat exchangers, actuators and sensors should be the focus of the proposal. Critical bottlenecks in the fuel cell system assembly, e.g. end-of-line testing can also be addressed.
The successful consortium must show evidence that critical bottlenecks specifically related to the fuel cell system and system component manufacturing are addressed. The minimum TRL for fuel cell systems and system components is 5.
Projects should achieve at least a manufacturing readiness level, MRL of 7* (Capability to produce systems, subsystems or components in a production representative environment) at project end, starting from a MRL of 5 (Capability to produce prototype components in a production relevant environment).
To demonstrate advancement with respect to the state-of-the-art on four critical parameters: cycle time, manufacturing cost, yield and reliability of the production process, project proposals are expected to cover the following top-level objectives:
Development of manufacturing technologies, beyond state of the art, specific to the PEMFC system production processes, equipment and tools
Transpose established automotive industry best practices on production and quality to the manufacturing of PEMFC system and system components, such as (but not limited to) lean manufacturing, Kaisen, six sigma
Identification of bottleneck processes in system or system component production lines
Identification and revision of critical sub-processes (e.g. low yield/high cost)
Improvement, modification, adaptation or even new development of at least two critical system or system component production steps
Integration of inline non-destructive quality control tools
Adaptation of system and/or system components design to optimize manufacturability
Development of QA strategies relevant for the transport sector compatible with ISO/TS 16949
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years

Expected impacts of the project include:
Taking into account the KPIs achieved within the project, such as yield, cycle time and production capacity, demonstrate through simulation that with the improvements in the production process and product, the PEMFC system production can be increased from few 100 units/year up to 50.000 units/year in 2020, for a total power range about 5 MW per year with a single line.
Produce and validate engineering samples of the improved design for manufacturability of at least one relevant component, including its product validation.
Validate in hardware, with cycle time measurement, cost analysis and statistical evaluation, the performance of the improved system or system component production steps.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Hydrogen tanks for automotive applications are already available but they do not yet fulfil all carmakers’ and customers’ expectations in the view of hydrogen powered vehicles as an alternative to conventional modern ICE-powered vehicles. Also, the current hydrogen business is small hence production is low, cost competitiveness and build-up of a European supply chain are challenging.
Four key challenges have been identified:
1. Achievement of the automotive performance and cost targets for a broader market introduction. This is mainly due to intensive carbon fiber use (quantity, quality and hence cost), conventional manufacturing processes and architectural concepts that are not compatible with mass production. To tackle this challenge, significant advances with respect to mechanical reinforcement, composite architecture optimization and improved designs of compressed overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV) with respect to cost, performance and manufacturing productivity are required.
2. Vessel and ancillary component (tank valve, pressure regulator,…) integration in the vehicle in order to ease assembling and integration procedures, thereby reducing cost and maximizing volume available to the customer.
3. Hydrogen refuelling times truly comparable to those of conventional fuels require an extended temperature range of the COPV. This would also greatly improve the safety margins with respect to temperature overshoot caused by possible malfunctions of the fuelling station. Likewise, being able to extract the maximum hydrogen mass flow regardless of the state of charge (SOC) calls for the ability of the COPV and the complete fuelling system to withstand and/or operate at lower temperatures.
4. Increase the acceptance of COPVs for hydrogen storage in automobile applications by means of offering a higher safety level. It is especially necessary to ensure that COPVs can be transferred into safe mode during thermal incidents.
Scope:
Development of new and/or optimized tank geometries having the same storage performance and providing an enhanced integration in the car space at a comparable price. The storage density shall be 0.023Kg/L or higher. The cost target for a production of 30,000 parts per year basis shall be 500€/kg H2 or less.
Improve filling and venting tolerance of COPV (e.g. enhanced liner materials and multi-material assembling materials and techniques to increase mechanical and temperature tolerance (e.g. real -40°C H2 filling, - 60°C cold filling, +100⁰C).
Development of an optimized production strategy (increased materials efficiency, weight and volume reduction, manufacturing optimization, optimum storage geometries/designs)
Miniaturization and integration of tank components, e.g. on-tank valve, pressure regulator
Define standardized interfaces and (sub)components in order to benefit from the economy of scales.
Development and validation of numerical tools (probabilistic models) to perform automatic or semi-automatic optimization of COPV performance and durability and reduce cost and manufacturing discrepancies.
Provide input to revised regulation codes and standards for compressed gaseous hydrogen (CGH2) tanks.
For protection against the worst-case scenario of the failure of the TPRD, a leak-before-burst vessel design should be developed. The failure mechanism of the vessel has to be studied and the reliability demonstrated. Furthermore, systems for detecting localized fires, enhanced fire protection systems/strategies as well as additional security measures are to be evaluated.
The consortium should include at least one vessel supplier, one pressure component developer and an OEM. The consortium should build on experience from past projects in the field (at national or European level) in order to push the most promising materials and technologies to a higher TRL/MRL.
TRL at start: 4
TRL at end: 6
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
Expected Impact:
Coherent strategy defining the ultimate weight/cost savings achievable with conventional COPV and/or novel geometries and/or novel architecture strategies providing the best trade-off.
Define production strategy in coherence with standard automotive throughput with a significant impact on:
COPV manufacturing yield (target: Increase productivity by a factor of 3)
Reduced performance scattering (Standard deviation of burst pressure reduced by 30%)
Improved filling/venting tolerance of storage systems (temperature range: -60°C to +100°C) to sustain fast-filling and unrestricted extraction.
Provide technical and performance validation of prototypes with respect to EU standards (e.g. EC79)
Produce whitepapers for RCS and/or maintenance guidance
Demonstrate leak-before-burst vessel designs and fire detection and protection concepts.
Strengthen the European industry, by creating knowledge in support of the EU growth and jobs policy agenda.
The following KPIs are expected to be reached at the tank system level in compliance with the MAWP:

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Compressed hydrogen tanks are a high-value component of strategic importance for the rollout of fuel cell mobility, but with few suppliers. They could constitute a multibillion market once hydrogen mobility matures and could offer a substantial economic opportunity for Europe. While companies with the background and skills to produce high-pressure tanks do exist in Europe, tank manufacture is currently a bottleneck in the European vehicle supply chain, in particular for buses.
The challenge behind this topic lies therefore in strengthening the European supply chain for compressed hydrogen storage for transport applications by driving competition among various players, which should lead to cost reduction and improved technical performance.
While similar projects have been financed in the past, it is necessary to broaden the number of players (Tier 1 and 2 suppliers) able to develop, produce, test, certify and commercialize the vessels and ancillary hydrogen storage systems, contribute to PNR and RCS development thus creating a market ready competitive environment and cost reduction. To this end the following technical areas challenges are fundamental as regards hydrogen tanks:
Achievement of the application specific (e.g. automotive, rail, maritime, bus, trucks, aeronautic, etc.) performance and cost targets for a broader market introduction. This is mainly due to intensive carbon fibre use (quantity, quality and hence cost), conventional manufacturing processes and architectural concepts that are not compatible with mass production. To tackle this challenge, significant advances with respect to mechanical reinforcement, composite architectural architecture optimization and improved designs of composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV) with respect to cost, performance and manufacturing productivity are required.
Hydrogen refuelling times truly comparable to those of conventional fuels require an extended temperature range of the COPV. This would also greatly improve the safety margins with respect to over temperature overshoot caused by possible malfunctions of the refuelling station. Likewise, being able to extract the maximum hydrogen mass flow independent regardless of the state of charge (SOC) calls for the ability of the COPV and the complete refuelling system to withstand and/or operate at lower temperatures.
Improvement of the intrinsic safety of COPV with respect to the worst-case scenario of TPRD (Thermally Activated Pressure Relief Device) malfunction within fire conditions.
Scope:
Given the scope of past projects financed by the FCH 2 JU, the topic is open to all transport applications.
The following should fall into the scope of the project:
Development of new and/or optimized tank geometries having the same storage performance and providing an enhanced integration in vehicle application space at a comparable price. The storage density of the system at room temperature should be at least 0.03Kg/lL for 700bar or 0.018Kg/lL for 350bar. The cost target for the whole system for a production of 30,000 parts per year basis should be 400€/kg H2 or less;
Improve filling and venting tolerance of COPV (e.g. enhanced liner materials and multi-material assembling materials and techniques to increase mechanical and temperature tolerance (e.g. real -40°C H2 filling, - 60°C cold filling, +100⁰C);
Development and validation of numerical tools (probabilistic models) to perform automatic or semi-automatic optimization of COPV performance and durability and reduce cost and manufacturing discrepancies;
Provide technical and performance validation of prototypes with respect to EU standards (e.g. EC79);
Improved safety stemming from demonstration of leak-before-burst vessel designs and fire detection and protection concepts;
For protection against the worst-case scenario of the failure of the TPRD, a leak-before-burst vessel design should be developed. In this connection, the failure mechanism of the vessel should be studied and the reliability demonstrated. Furthermore, systems for detecting localized fires, and efficient enhanced fire protection systems/strategies as well as additional security measures are to be evaluated;
TRL at start: 4 and TRL at end: 6.
The proposal is expected to include at least one vessel and/or material supplier, one research institute and an OEM, such that the full supply chain is represented and works towards end customer targets. It is also expected to build on experience from past projects in the field (at national or European level) in order to push the most promising materials and technologies to a higher TRL/MRL.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2.7 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
Expected Impact:
Coherent strategy defining the ultimate weight/cost savings achievable with conventional COPV and/or novel geometries and/or novel architecture strategies providing the best trade-off;
Improved filling/venting tolerance of storage systems (temperature range: -60°C to +100°C) to sustain fast-filling and unrestricted extraction;
Strengthen the European COPV development and supply chain;
The following KPIs are expected to be reached at storage system level in compliance with the MAWP:
Volumetric capacity: 0.03Kg/lL for 700bar or .0.18Kg/lL for 350bar;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
One of the most important objectives of FCH 2 JU is the support of the industrialization of fuel cell technology and systems for all kinds of applications, mobile and stationary. In many of these applications, fuel cell technology is and will be competing with other well-established technologies. The market price, durability and performance of the established technologies (internal combustion engines, gas turbines, partly batteries) have been optimized over many years, so that it is hard to compete with for the rather new fuel cell technology, which is a complex and highly integrated mechatronic and chemical system of systems.
Durability and performance, especially for transport applications with high dynamic performance requirements are ‘must-haves’ for fuel cells, and both production and development cost will influence a fast market penetration significantly. To reach these goals, drivetrains are usually an optimized hybrid system composed of a fuel cell system and a battery.

The way and the degree of coupling between batteries and fuel cells is the result of trade-off between autonomy range, weight and costs, and up to now limited analysis/development of hybridization strategies has been performed (see example of project SWARM). The development of a model-based tool and its experimental validation for designing a hybrid system in early phases is of particular importance to accelerate the understanding and development of new products. This environment needs to be available soon to enable the European fuel cell industry, in particular the SMEs to develop and optimize fully functional, highly reliable and cost-effective products. Such highly integrated product design and development environment should combine virtual (i.e. simulation based) and physical (i.e. experiment based) aspects seamlessly over the whole development process. For example, numerical/physical models used in the first phase of fuel cell system development have to be continuously replaced by emulators for physical components that do not yet exist and combined with already available real hardware. This versatile mixed virtual / real development environment serves as a basis for control development, pre-calibration, functional and performance optimization and validation, sensitivity analysis etc. throughout the entire development process.
Scope:
The overall objective of the topic is to develop a validated fuel cell system model and its hybridization, and use it to assess design-point, part-load, dynamic performance and customized energy management strategies for automotive applications (also using results and data of previous research activities in this area). The proposal should address both numerical development (design and validation of an open-access modelling tool) and technological development (design, achievement and validation of the physical platform) with the following possible and successive steps:
Design of a multi-application physical platform consistent with a wide variety of applications and hybridized architectures;
Building and qualification of such a platform and validation of coupling with the open access software to be developed in parallel;
Testing and validation of the platform with a real example (e.g. hybridized bus, truck, ship etc.) to validate the robustness of the platform. This step should produce optimised components of the FC system from the preliminary dimensioning steps and then should test them on the platform with operating conditions as close as possible to real operation conditions; some adjustments of both numerical and physical components of the platform might be foreseen.
In a first step and with the support/feed-back of an end-user, the most critical issues related to hybridization (e.g. energy management, system and component lifetime etc.) should be identified. The impact of system design and energy demand profile on the system performance, reliability and the durability should also be assessed. This should rely on two aspects:
An open, seamless and highly integrated development platform for fast prototyping described as X-in-the-Loop (XiL) where X stands for model, software or hardware (MiL, SiL or HiL) of complex hybrid FC systems which goes far beyond existing specific simulation and experimental tools. Such a development platform should enable the combination and utilization of best in class or specialized tools, integrate XiL and real-time systems, allow massively parallel simulations and experimental tools for optimization and complex multi-scenario validation, fully support high performance and cloud computing as well as cross-company product validation, based on technologies like co-simulation and experimental testing as a service;
Creating a common simulation, experimental and validation platform to exchange code libraries, models and best practices; UML 2.0 standard [1] should be used. Physical based model for lifetime prediction should also be included as well as an off-line (based on on-field data provided by end-users) or on-line (experimental characterisation at approx. 1kWe scale) study of different strategies on the system behaviour.
The system definition should start from the stack level to optimize the operating conditions of the fuel cell and to minimize the degradation of the MEAs. Therefore, a hybrid fuel cell system could be developed with a reduced time comparable to development time frames of today’s conventional powertrains and taking into consideration the aspects from the material performance and durability (using experimental and model-based development approaches) and up to the assembly process and control strategies development. The integration and validation of advanced control including physical or signal treatment-based models, specifically for lifetime optimization (as state observers), should be validated both experimentally and in a modular mixed virtual/physical XiL platform. The modularity of this platform should allow the continuously and seamlessly integration of already developed components of the fuel cell system, including controllers, Balance of Plant (BoP) components, power electronics, etc. with the stack, even with different fuel cell system architectures.
Finally, the environment should also allow the consideration and investigation of hybrid systems to optimize the sizing of fuel cell and battery hybrid systems simultaneously within their constraints, including on-line power management strategies.
Real time capability of emulators and related numerical models for the components and the entire environment should be a prerequisite to validate the different algorithms (fuel cell system control and power management) and control strategies.
The increasing complexity of models on various levels (from subcomponent to system-of-systems level) should be approached with automated parameterization functionalities and algorithms, and a seamless switching between real and emulated parts.
Fuel cell technology would profit from such a development platform significantly, as product development and optimization could be performed here “ab initio” on these new standards rather than needing to replace existing classical development routes and in development time frames suitable for typical industrial product cycles in the range of 36 to 60 months.
The XiL platform should be open regarding the interfaces to other third party simulation and testing modules and tools (including co-simulation etc.). The XiL platform should also consider interfaces for future web-based services and data exchange.
It is expected that at least several end-users or vehicle manufacturers to be part of the consortium.

A better understanding of hybridization strategies on the performance, reliability and durability, for reference cases representing typical transport industrial applications. This includes a benchmark of current optimization algorithms (off-line and on-line);

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Commercial trucks, that are responsible for a quarter of road transport CO2 emissions, are particularly sensitive to H2 storage system density. The length and height of road vehicles in EU are limited to 16.5m and 4m, respectively. As a consequence, truck manufacturers have to choose between less payload (since a bulky H2 takes valuable space away from the cargo) and less range when designing H2 vehicles. The range limitation is less critical for fleet trucks with short routes: 350 bar H2 storage seems to be sufficient for municipal vehicles, buses and even parcel delivery trucks. For trucking applications with larger payload and less dense HRS network, for instance regional and long haul, other solutions need to be investigated. Pressures of 500 to 700 bar indeed offer more volumetric capacity (more than 20 to 45% over 350 bar) but these solutions are costly and bring in hurdles on the infrastructure where large capacities need to be dispensed rapidly, while controlling the inlet temperature and allowing high station demand (“back-to-back”).
350/700 bar storage requires compression and high-pressure storage at the hydrogen station, which takes footprint and important CAPEX/OPEX. Those will not be needed for LH2 on-board, which require solely a LH2 tank and a transfer pump in addition to dispenser(s), allowing to save costs on the whole H2 chain. No industrial actors or consortia have started to develop consistently such technology in the world. Actors of the EU industry are currently well positioned and by pursuing this activity, have the potential to become world leaders.
Storing LH2 (Liquid Hydrogen) on-board offers unprecedented storage density (two times more compared to 700 bar) while greatly improving the cost and complexity of high-throughput gaseous H2 refuelling stations. Even though on-board LH2 storage has been disregarded for light-duty vehicles (see the example of BMW 7 Hydrogen mini-series in 2005-2007 [25]), its relevance for applications that require larger capacities (40 to more than 100kg H2) and that experience much more utilization (more than 100,000 km/year) deserve to be carefully evaluated.
LH2 tanks have been used as stationary storage in industrial facilities, and of course in various space programs, for half a century. However, no on-board LH2 storage for transportation vehicles exists today. The on-board environment has very unique challenges for LH2: insulation optimization vs. gravimetric, functional, mechanical and safety requirements, fluid regulations for various modes (acceleration, parking refuelling etc.), compliance with stringent regulations and end-user interface.
[25]: For reference, estimated performances for the BMW 7 LH2 storage system are 9% wtH2 and 40 gH2/L for a capacity of 8 kg H2
Scope:
The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of using LH2 for heavy-duty vehicles through a design study followed by a demonstration test bench. The first phase of this effort will consist of mechanical and fluid design. This will include an investigation from the end-user perspective, by simulating real-life utilization (H2 extraction, driving, parking and refuelling) and making sure that the state-of-charge, the actual boil-off and the refuelling are compatible with the expectations. A few configurations will be used as benchmark: rail mounting, behind cab, and within frame. The overall shape of the storage system is important, and advanced storage solutions to optimize the energy density (through e.g. a single vacuum jacket with multiple cylinders) should be investigated. The mechanical design should meet all requirements typical of the trucking industry in terms of durability, exposure to harsh environments, vibrations, accelerations, safeties. Pressure in the LH2 storage tank should be compatible with the pressure at which the fuel cell typically operates. Alternatively, mitigation strategies should be proposed.
The nominal target capacity considered in the scope of this topic is 40-100 kg LH2, with gravimetric and volumetric (usable) system densities of 10% wt H2 and 45 g H2/L for a 24 to 72 hour-dormancy, boil-off rates < 5%/day and compatibility with fuelling rates of up to 10 kg/min.
All the activities should consider the current EC79/200926 (liquid hydrogen storage systems) and other relevant standards. Refuelling technologies are not within the scope of this topic, although the prototype should be compatible with an efficient refuelling process. The consortium should establish links with ongoing projects dedicated to relevant applications such as H2HAUL27 and future project under ongoing FCH 2 JU call 2019 “Topic FCH-04-2-2019: Refuelling Protocols for Medium and Heavy-Duty Vehicles”.
TRL at start of the project: 4 and TRL at the end of the project: 5.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
The much greater intrinsic energy density of LH2 (70 g/L) compared to 350 bar (24 g/L) and 700 bar (40 g/L) enables to increase dramatically the autonomy of the vehicle, and come closer to LNG truck autonomy; also reducing the overall number of hydrogen stations needed, and hence the average hydrogen cost at the pump.
The following KPIs should be reached by the end of the project:
CAPEX storage tank: €320/kg H2;
Volumetric capacity at tank system level: 0.045kg/L28;
Gravimetric capacity at tank system level: 10% (H2/(H2+tank system)).
In addition, although not addressed in this topic, it should contribute to pave the way towards the following KPIs on the infrastructure side as LH2 on-board storage solutions mature: station energy consumption of 0.05kWh/kg and CAPEX HRS: 2M€ @2t/day.
This project should represent the first step towards large adoption of the on-board LH2 technology and the creation of related standardized refuelling protocols. By enabling longer haul applications and cheaper cost of hydrogen at the pump, the LH2 on-board technology should enable larger scale deployments of hydrogen trucks than with state of the art storage methods, thus proving as unavoidable for zero emission heavy-duty transportation.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Typical PEMFC systems still have important challenges before mass production in transportation may be realised, namely cost, reliability and durability. Some of these challenges can be tackled improving the system components as well as by introducing novel system configurations.
While the technical feasibility has been demonstrated in several configurations, a major challenge remains on the high cost of these solutions due to low production volumes, the use of expensive materials and designs not suitable for automated manufacturing. Moreover, the supply chain for some components is still not in place.
Some of the specific outstanding issues concern the freeze start that is still too long and not reliable for low cost stacks and the water management at low temperatures and subsequent freeze preparation. Some failure modes for key components such as compressor air bearings have still to be solved. Packaging in combination with cost effective solutions remain an issue in view of future integration in mass production of the automotive industry.
In addition, the fuel cell system, power degradation is still too high, caused by events such as start-up/shut-down, fuel starvation and potential cycling. With novel system architecture and component designs, the FC degradation can be reduced to levels equivalent to incumbent technologies.
The biggest cost-down leverage in a FC system is on the cathode side: the components are usually the most expensive and the ones with the highest parasitic power and strongest impact to FC performance.
Additionally, the automotive supply chain needs to be established for some of the components and should be further supported by bringing together OEM and potential n-Tier suppliers in development projects such as the present one.
Scope:
The project should focus on the improved industrialization-ready designs of high efficiency and low cost Balance-of-Plant (BoP) PEMFC system components on the cathode side (compressor, humidification, intercooler, valves, and turbine/expander). The FC stack is also within the scope to be funded, although it is not the focus of the innovation. The FC stack is required to demonstrate the system level performance and may therefore be adapted from existing technology.
Development of a new generation of systems using cost engineering to identify cost reduction potentials for each component and perform design-to-cost activities and trade-offs with other BoP components. As an example: low O2 permeation valves can be used to reduce O2 ingress into the stack and thus decreasing start-up (SU) degradation. The project must include durability testing of the components (or testing at the system level if meaningful) under automotive conditions.
The project must address the following key issues:
Novel system prototypes that eliminate or reduce issues currently experienced with PEMFC systems such as voltage cycling, SU/SD corrosion which leads to increased degradation
Freeze start design and system component layout to minimize water pooling and consequent ice blockages and reduction of thermal mass to enable faster start up at sub-zero temperatures
Air compressor prototypes that simultaneously
provide higher efficiency at max load point to enable reduction of parasitic power while providing increased durability
meet automotive dynamic requirements (0-90% power in 0.5s)
improve flow vs. pressure operating window at low current densities
Optionally the project can also address the following issues:
Turbine/expanders prototypes that reduce parasitic losses with high recovery efficiency.
New humidification prototypes that simultaneously
improve water transfer rates between wet and dry side
improve durability to meet automotive requirements of 6,000h
minimize packaging space
reduce pressure drop
Intercoolers (gas-to-gas or gas-to-liquid) that simultaneously
high thermal transfer efficiency
minimize package space
reduce pressure drop
To insure the usefulness of the results for the automotive industry, the following methodologies are required:
Automotive development methods, design to cost, reliability and robustness methods
Detailed component level simulation for analysis and optimization (e.g. of multiphase transport and phase transition processes including multi-component diffusion and mixing phenomena of humidifiers etc.)
Sub-system and system level simulation for component specification and assessment of overall performance of different component configurations
Automated-/hardware-in-the-loop-/accelerated testing methods
TRL at start: 4
TRL at end: 7
The consortium should include at least one automotive OEM or their subsidiaries and at least one fuel cell component manufacturer and/or relevant suppliers to the automotive industry. A higher number of suppliers is recommended but not mandatory.
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
By addressing design to manufacturing and cost engineering tools, further cost-down potential should be reached on the main BoP components, thus bringing costs in line with positive business cases at the system level, not only for OEMs but also for the entire supply chain.
The project must show that the proposed BoP solutions support the targets at the FC system level. Details on the trade-offs between stack and BoPs including cost estimation are expected. All projects must also produce validated evidence of lifetimes; cost targets and efficiencies throughout life.
The following KPIs are expected to be reached at the FC system level:
FC system production cost: 100 €/kW at 50 000 units/year production rate
Maximum power degradation of 10% after 6000 h for passenger cars
Cold Start: Improved freeze start up performance and reliability closer to standard automotive conditions"

While emission regulations have been enforced in road transport for more than 2 decades, maritime transport is still, largely, utilising heavy fuel oil and high sulphur containing diesel. In cities with major harbours, maritime transport is today contributing significantly to air pollution.
Emission Control Areas (ECAs) are defined in the North and Baltic Sea (requiring the use of low-sulphur diesel) and along the North American coastline. ECA regulations have been proposed also for e.g., the Mediterranean Sea, and the coastlines of Australia, Japan and Norway. To comply with these more stringent local emission regulations, conventional propulsion systems based on internal combustion engines (ICEs) are subject to installing costly exhaust cleaning technologies.
Moreover, European GHG emission targets for 2030 along with the ambitions of shifting especially freight from road to rail and sea underlines the urgency of introducing low and 0-emission solutions also for maritime transport. Some European cities (e.g., Amsterdam) have already announced 0-emission requirements for cruise-ships in harbour within 2025. Environmental legislation designed to reduce emissions across the maritime industry is hence placing higher demands for compliance upon ship owners and operators.
Consequently, conventional ICE-based drivelines are currently being hybridized with batteries for reducing fuel consumption and the high local emission from ICE drivelines operating at part load. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as a marine fuel constitutes a commercially available solution, which is almost eliminating local emissions (SOx, NOx, PM). Replacing diesel with LNG may reduce CO2-emissions by 15-20%, but this is not compliant with the 40 % GHG reduction ambitions for 2030.
A first generation of pure battery-electric ships have been introduced in recent years. The largest to date is the 1 MW ferry boat Ampere which has been in operation since early 2015 in Norway. However, battery-electric ships have limited range, long charging time and require a high capacity grid connection. In that respect hydrogen and FC technology represents a promising option.
FCs have been demonstrated for propulsion in several smaller slow speed vessels. PEMFCs and hydrogen as fuel is dominating and the power range is typically up to 100 kW. Lately, several initiatives have been taken for utilising FCs at higher power ranges and in high-speed vessels. Leading FC suppliers are now adapting MW-scale FC systems for maritime use. For wide deployment of FC technologies in maritime transport there is, however, still a series of specific challenges which needs to be addressed, including durability, system power density for high speed vessels, compatibility with maritime conditions (saline air, shock, rolling & vibration), high volume bunkering, regulations, codes and standards (incl. redundancy), and public acceptance.
Scope:
The scope of this topic is the development and demonstration of at least 2 mid-size FC powered ships each with a minimum nominal FC system power of 400 kW, for inland/coastal freight or transportation of more than 100 passengers. A total minimum nominal FC system power of 1MW should be installed in the ships. The ships should be used on a daily basis in order to gain relevant operational experience. Refuelling (bunkering) to sustain the normal operational profile of the vessels is considered within the scope of this topic. Exploitation of synergies with refuelling infrastructure for other applications are considered however advantageous.
To assess different operational scenarios the ships shall operate at 2 different locations. The demonstrations should highlight the superior energy density and short refuelling time of hydrogen vs pure battery solutions. Batteries may however be included in a FC hybrid configuration to reduce fuel consumption and smoothen power demands on the FC unit. Retrofit of FC systems to replace conventional fossil-fuelled propulsion is also within the scope of the topic. An averaged minimum of 50 % renewable based hydrogen is required during the demonstration. Access cost of hydrogen compared to diesel is eligible.
The construction of the demonstration vessels' hull, superstructure and other components unrelated to the FC propulsion system, as well as operational costs such as crew are not considered eligible costs.
The project should address the following key issues:
Development of a FC system suitable for integration in new and existing ships, complying with maritime requirements regarding safety, redundancy and operational conditions ;
Adaption and certification/approval of a new or retrofit of an existing vessel (i.e. the vessel cost is not eligible);
Develop a suitable bunkering technology and process, based on existing HRS technology developed in previous FCH JU projects;
Operation of the FC technology during test period and assessment of the technology in maritime conditions by the end-users including the related infrastructure;
Transfer of fuel cell technology developed and applied in previous FCH 2 JU projects;
Assessment of suitable business models for maritime transport applications, to foster further commercialization of technical solutions both on board the vessel and bunkering/refuelling;
Monitoring during the operation the advantages in terms of emission reduction, noise reduction, improved image, availability, reliability and customer needs;
Dissemination of the demonstration activities and achievements and support the EU member states promotion of clean vessel technology on the basis of this demonstration;
The hydrogen infrastructure should be designed to provide hydrogen at the required quality, amounts and reliability to maintain normal operation of the ship. Technology and processes should be based on current proven hydrogen refuelling technology (e.g., for buses).
The project should cooperate on ongoing activities with relevant organisations such as CESNI (European Committee for inland navigation vessels standards), IMO (International Maritime Organisation) and certification bodies. The project shall include an operational period of at least 18 months for each vessel. The proposal is expected to include a vessel OEM to ensure the transition to commercialization of the technology.
TRL at the start of the project: 4-5.
TRL at the end of the project: 6-7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 4 years
Expected Impact:
This project is expected to develop and demonstrate hydrogen powered ships for medium sized inland and coastal freight and/or passenger transportation with daily normal missions, meeting customer needs. It is expected that the project provides a significant step towards implementation of FCs and hydrogen as fuel in maritime transport, by reducing costs while increasing the maturity, reliability and lifetime. The project will demonstrate the superior features of FC-based propulsion as compared to pure battery-powered vessels as well as the benefits from hybridising FCs with batteries for maritime transport applications. The demonstration shall also strengthen the European supply chain and reveal viable business models for inland/coastal maritime transport applications. It will, moreover, provide for increased visibility of the potential for FCH technologies as a means for de-carbonizing inland/coastal transportation.
More specifically, the expected impacts include:
Successful demonstration of two FC-powered ships for inland/coastal applications before 2023;
The performance targets should comply with the MAWP bus targets;
Average availability of the ships of at least 90%;
100% of on board power for auxiliaries and propulsion to be FC or FC battery hybrid;
Vessel to be in service no less frequently than the conventional IC engine equivalent;
Technical solutions meet all local safety requirements concerning gas storage and fuelling within the operational environment;
Speed and performance no less than the normal IC engine based service;
Systems design life of at least ten years (servicing allowed);
Lessons learnt from implementing and operating FC ships, identification of bottlenecks – technical, organisational, structural, financial including RCS and formulation of recommendations on how to address these;
Lowering CO2 and pollutant emissions from inland/coastal transport;
Reduce noise in urban areas and increase public awareness;
Contribute to significant further capital cost reduction of fuel cells and refuelling infrastructure.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The 5th objective of the FCH 2 JU [1] addresses the reduction of critical raw materials [2]. This is the main challenge of this topic. In addition, increase in the competitiveness of European partners in manufacturing Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEAs) and Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) stacks by reducing the cost of PEMFC stacks and gaining novel materials knowledge is also a major objective of this topic.
An estimated 30% of the cost of PEMFC is driven by the use of Platinum (Pt) as a very effective hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction catalyst in low temperature PEMFC fuel cells. In addition, Pt is sensitive to contamination from impurities in the hydrogen and certain air contaminants. Many projects are already dealing with decreasing Pt loading in MEAs, but to ensure Europe's competitive position and to reduce market pressure on the use of scarce noble metals, it is mandatory that the transition to a next-generation PEMFC using Platinum Group Metals-free (PGM-free) catalysts is made as quickly as possible, and that promising routes are explored to remove Pt and other critical raw materials from PEMFC. The ultimate ideal industrial goal is to manufacture PEMFC stacks for transport application with Non-PGM catalysts, and with performance and durability comparable to the targets defined for Pt.

[2] List of critical raw materials:http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52014DC0297&from=EN
Scope:
As a step towards this ultimate goal, the priority of the project is to develop and test at single cell scale Non-PGM catalysts on the cathode side with sufficiently improved performance and durability compared to the current State-of-Art of Non-PGM catalysts. This step is focused on the cathode side as the Pt loading on the anode side is currently significantly lower than the one on the cathode side. However, reduction or elimination of PGM on the anode is also in the scope. Development on membrane, bipolar plate, or gas diffusion layer is not the subject of this topic.
The project shall address the targets defined in the expected impacts and, as far as possible, evaluate solutions to reach the ultimate ideal goal of the topic step by step (same performance and durability than with pure Platinum). These targets shall be demonstrated under the EU harmonized testing procedures [3] and especially EU harmonized test protocols for PEMFC MEA testing in single cells configuration for automotive applications. A collaboration mechanism needs to be developed with the JRC, in relation to the ongoing EU protocol harmonisation and validation activities performed in support of the FCH2-JU programme.
The proposal should also include:
• Benchmark of SoA low-TRL Non-PGM catalysts.
• Diagnostics and analysis tools to better understand durability, performance, electrochemical reaction mechanisms, active site densities, protonic and electronic conductivities, mass transport limitations such as electronic microscopy, modelling, specific local diagnostics and instrumentation, specific tests.
• Assessment of cost, life-cycle and commercial exploitation potential of the proposed solutions compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.
The proposals shall build on results from past or on-going FCH-JU projects dealing with substitution of Platinum for PEMFC.
The proposals should include a clear go-no go decision at mid-term as a basis to decide on the follow-up of the project. The go-no go criteria shall be based on the targets listed under section Expected Impacts.
The consortium should include research organizations, universities, a catalyst manufacturer; and OEM. International collaboration in this field is highly encouraged, especially with IPHE members.
TRL at the beginning of the project: 2
TRL at end of the project: 3
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2.75 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Demonstrate the performance in Rotating Disk Electrode (RRDE)
Demonstrate the performance and durability in single cell: at laboratory scale (at least 25 cm²) and at industrial scale (at least 200 cm²)

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The aeronautic sector is currently entering a major transformation phase triggered by the environmental urgency, the evolution of humans’ movements associated to new transportation means and the emergence of new aerial platforms. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has driven the aeronautic industry to introduce the concept of More Electrical Aircraft, but a deeper transition is needed and hybrid-electric or even full electric propulsion is now considered to tackle the environmental challenge, as stated in the Clean Sky JU bi-annual work plan 2016-2017 [16]. This addresses the need for continuous work on Green Regional Aircraft to mature, validate and demonstrate the technologies best fitting the environmental goals set for the regional aircraft that will fly in 2020+. Accordingly, the Green Regional Aircraft has five main domains of research: low weight configuration, low noise configuration, all electric aircraft, mission and trajectory management, and new configuration. The power requirements for the propulsion of common aircraft are however tremendous (in the range of 1 MW for a 19 pax intercity commuter) and not reasonably achievable today. This assessment accounts for the necessity to start considering this technological challenge today with an intermediate step at lower scale.
The aeronautic industry sees new concepts appear to take advantage of operating in the airspace by introducing new flying platforms, either uninhabited (UAV) or inhabited (passenger aircraft). Personal flying vehicles (2 to 4 pax, 40 to 100 kW or more) are becoming a reality and most of them are based on electric powertrain (Lilium https://lilium.com/, E-Volo http://www.e-volo.com/index.php/en/). Even though fuel cell systems have already been introduced on light flying platforms, it is still necessary to bring it to larger scales, to deploy widely the technology, to make it compatible with market requirements and to address certification.
Most of new flying platforms concepts are electrically driven and powered by batteries. The bottleneck of such vehicles is the strong limitation in autonomy due to the poor energy and power density reached by battery systems. Hydrogen and fuel cell systems are a promising option to increase the range and thus the credibility of such new flying platforms, within a short term. In addition, fuel cell technologies offer more flexibility in operation such as fast refuelling.
The effects of high altitudes (and reduced O2 concentration and partial pressure levels) on performance need to be further addressed and modular architectures approach considered to optimize the efficiency. The BoP main components, such as the air compressor, the hydrogen storage and the power electronics, will have high requirements, which still need to be clearly defined in accordance with performance dependency to altitude. Even though work has been engaged to define RCS for hydrogen and fuel cells in aviation, a lot remains to be done, especially to consider propulsion applications.

Scope:
The project should develop and demonstrate a fuel cell system dedicated to the propulsion of a 2 to 19 passengers regional aircraft emission free. The fuel cell system (FCS) architecture shall be modular and adaptable to different aerial vehicles such as UAVs with similar payloads capability. The aerial vehicle to be considered for demonstration should be able to carry a payload between 160 and 350 kg and have a range of 1 to 2 hours. The system to be developed should be based on an architecture involving elementary power modules and on technologies previously developed in the scope of previous FCH JU projects. The aim of such modular architecture is first to allow a scaling of the system to address a range of platforms and second to offer redundancy and therefore increase the reliability of the propulsive power source.
In order to bring a competitive and efficient solution, the following key objectives should be considered:
Fuel cell system power output in the following ranges: fuel cell system total output power on demonstrator: 40 to 150 kW (multiple modules for 19 seater aircraft);
Adjust or re-use key components and subsystems allowing to reach gravimetric energy and power density, safety and lifetime under aeronautic RCS requirements
Fuel cell stack (at least 2 kW/kg, re-used from previous project);
Air feeding subsystem (efficiency > 50 % at high pressure ratio);
Hydrogen storage (> 5,5 % mass efficiency);
Power converter (> 5 kW/kg);
System lifetime target at least 4 000 hours;
Integration, installation into aircraft, industrialization and cost competitiveness have to be optimized in order to bring realistic solution. When applicable, aeronautic RCS have to be taken into account and compliance should be demonstrated (DO160, EASA CS-VLA, EASA CS23,…). Focus of the project will be the elaboration of the certification plan derived from existing RCS and to apply it to the system to be demonstrated in flight. The most-up to date RCS will be taken into account and gaps in the legislation will be highlighted;
Implement simulation and model-based design methodology for optimal design trade-offs (performances, durability) and definition of most suitable control strategies;
Experimental demonstration:
At laboratory level for components/subsystem/system, durability and reliability according to application requirements;
Under realistic conditions of system performance and range; for passenger aircraft, the demonstration will be performed with elementary power modules (not the full-scale power) composed of full-scale components;
An in-flight demonstration of at least a single module in an existing plane.
Perform economical assessment and derive Fuel Cell system Total Cost of Ownership for the selected target application including hydrogen refueling and system maintenance; Perform environmental assessment and derive fuel cell propulsive system potential GHG emission reductions;
The project should start with a global TRL of 3 to 4 for the considered components and conclude to the demonstration of a TRL 6 with tests in representative conditions of real environment and in flight demonstration.
The consortium should gather both academic and industrials with previous experience in the field of fuel cell applications for aeronautic and able to bring expertise in development, conception and testing in conditions representative of an aeronautical environment.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 4 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 4 years
Expected Impact:
The first expected impact is to increase the range and autonomy of small battery based electrical aerial vehicles by a factor of two to four, allowing reaching relevant levels, compatible with targeted markets (people and goods transportation, industrial applications) and therefore, contributing to decarbonizing transportation. The second expected impact is to increase the credibility and therefore the consideration of fuel cell systems for the propulsion of passenger aircraft and UAVs in order to pave the way toward All Electric Aircraft. The development project of an All Electric 19 pax inter-city aircraft is a tremendous work, which will require major budget. It could only be initiated if feasibility is demonstrated at lower scale and if technical and economic targets are clearly and precisely established earlier.
Another expected impact is the demonstration of the compliance to aviation standards of safety validated and demonstrated, to provide recommendations for RCS definition/amendments in the aerospace sector, for qualification test campaigns. For that, a connection should be established with the EUROCAE WG80 and the FAA's Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC), which involve aeronautical industry, FAA and EASA for the development of standards for hydrogen Fuel Cell system for Airborne applications. The project should therefore demonstrate clear in-roads on the path to the certification process, still a major roadblock on future commercialization.
The outcome should also allow to demonstrate the economic viability of a fuel cell and hydrogen based solution for the propulsion of a small aerial platform.
The fuel cell system lifetime and durability under representative operating conditions (≥ 4000 h accumulated operation under load of the very same FCS) is also part of the expected impacts, in addition to the following:
Silent FC-based powertrain system operation: < 60dB(A);
Structuration of the European aerospace sector to be in a leading market position for aerospace fuel cell systems, fostering EU FC-supply chain and creation of highly qualified jobs across the complete supply chain;
Strengthening synergies with Clean Sky 2 JU in order to promote the fuel cell & hydrogen technologies in line with the conclusion from the joint workshop in 2015 [17];
Europe’s competitiveness in the field of FCS for aerial propulsion is key and USA, China, Canada have already demonstrated several prototypes or even products (MMC HyDrone 1800, BOEING EcoDemonstrator, …). The expected impact is to increase the market share to be taken by European industry, creating activity and jobs.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Automotive application requests next generation PEMFC operating at high current densities (>2.7A/cm²), low noble catalyst loading (<0.08 mg/cm²), high power densities (>1.8W/cm², 9.3 kW/l), with high durability (>6,000h) and low cost (<50€/kW), as defined for horizon 2024 in the MAWP. The current status (for instance AutoStackCore project) is still far from these targets reaching approx. 1.13 W/cm², 4.1kW/l for approx. 0.4 mg/cm² during 3,500 hours. It is obvious that a disruptive approach is mandatory to reach these targets, including new materials and associated processes, new components design, and new stack architecture. Consequently, such next generation MEA (Membrane Electrode Assembly) shall deliver much higher power densities than the current ones and the SRU (Single Repeat Unit) of the stack will be much thinner and lighter, and based on ultra-thin MEA with ultra-low catalyst loadings. Based on this, two sets of questions can be highlighted i) what kind of new or exacerbated phenomena can occur with these next generation MEA, and ii) how can power density be increased when reducing catalyst loading at the same time? A common issue is to better understand the performance limitations for such MEA to propose new design and materials to overcome these issues.
Until now, the mechanisms inducing these limitations in performance are still under discussion and the relationship between the structure/design of the materials and the performance is not understood enough despite some recent progress. It is thus very difficult to define how far the performance could be increased by modifying the MEA. To better understand heat, mass and charge transport limitations in a MEA will allow proposing reliable breakthroughs in component design, operation strategies and performance prediction.
Scope:
This topic is focused on the basic understanding of promising MEAs and MEAs components to meet the target of high-power density PEMFC single repeat unit. Only MEAs and MEA components showing performance greater than all of 0.79W/cm2 and 2,450hrs (which are approx. 70% of the current State of the Art (SoA) status quoted above) and at Platinum loading less than 0.50 mg/cm² (total loading) proven in automotive testing condition (as defined in JRC99115) are eligible as reference materials for this topic.
The project should include all of the following issues:
Transport mechanisms, properties and limitations in the components (protons, electrons, liquid water, gases, heat) of the catalyst layer and microporous layer and at the interfaces, e.g. between catalyst layer and membrane, and between catalyst/layer and transport media in coupling with the electrochemical mechanisms. This includes the mechanisms and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction as a function of local conditions (temperature, partial pressure of reactants and products) in relation with catalyst surface structure and composition (e.g. oxides, hydroxides coverages). The Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL) and the interface between GDL and flow channels could be also considered if clearly justified as major issue. Project should be focused on MEA targeting ultra-low Pt loading (< 0.08 mg/cm²), high power density (> 1.8 W/cm²) and compact design (ultra-thin materials and designs, typically two to three-times thinner than today). The type of MEA should be proposed by the consortium while the project should account as much as possible for ‘generic’ situations applicable to SoA MEA and next generation MEA;
The MEA should present reasonable durability, e.g. performance decay less than 50 μV/h. Durability is also an issue for such low catalyst loadings. As this topic is focused on understanding the performance limitations to increase power densities, the understanding of durability issues is not part of the topic. Nevertheless, it will be highly appreciated to check durability of the MEA tested and especially to test how durability is modified by using MEA with increased power densities due to better heat and mass transports inside the MEA;
Combine experiments and modelling to predict the overall performance of a Single Repeat Unit (SRU) in a real stack geometry. It is expected to give the most accurate phenomenological description of the major limiting phenomena and their coupling thanks to specific experiments and the associated validated models. This should be assessed thanks to an accurate characterization, description and simulation of the local conditions and components structure and composition from 1-10 μm down to the 5-50 nm scale, considering the SRU design and real operating conditions. These measurements of the local conditions in a real stack design (MEA surface representative of a full-scale stack geometry) will also be established from the beginning of the project on the last state-of-the-art selected stack design and ultrathin MEA. The main idea is to bridge the gap between the local composition, structure and properties of the components, from the ‘micro’-scale, their effective properties at the ‘meso’-scale and their performance for different operating conditions when assembled in a SRU[1]. Mechanistic models for the description of the basic phenomena are highly desirable and then could be upscaled to be included in ones usable at the ‘macro-scale’. Model components and systems could be used for easier model validation in addition to dedicated validation experiments. The experiments must be conducted in conditions as close as possible to the ones of real operating PEMFC stack. Operando characterisation are recommended but ex-situ characterisation mimicking real conditions are also acceptable. At least, transport phenomena with phase change and two-phase flow must be addressed in the proposal.
The implementation of original methods or approaches is preferable, either in addition to or in coupling with improved conventional ones, both for experimental or modelling aspects.
In order to demonstrate the progress beyond the state-of-art in MEA development, the consortium should cooperate with the ongoing or finished projects (not only FCH 2 JU supported) in order to make consistent technical choices based on preliminary results from these former projects and target materials that have already proven certain performance.
The consortium is expected to contain at least one OEM partner that should take part in the technical work.
It is expected that the project will contribute towards the objectives and activities of the Hydrogen Innovation Challenge (as detailed under section 3.2.G. International cooperation). Promoting international collaboration beyond EU Member States and H2020 Associated Countries is therefore strongly encouraged.
TRL at start: 2 and TRL at end: 3-4.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
More than 1 project may be funded under this topic for complementary approaches.
Expected duration: 3-4 years.
[1]: Local properties and composition can include for instance 3D solid phase and composition at the pore scale (also called the ‘micro’-scale), effective properties refer to an average of the local properties over a heterogeneous system which can then be used to describe the system as a homogeneous one (also called the ‘meso’-scale), for instance effective electrical conductivity.
Expected Impact:
The project should result in:
Justifying and characterizing the performance limitations and the effective properties of the MEA;
Quantifying and predicting the local operating conditions inside a MEA;
Designing recommendations for components to increase performance of MEA ;
Preliminary orientations for future studies and development to reach the durability targets.
The main KPIs to be reached are the following:
Power density > 1.8 W/cm2 at 0.66 V;
Max operating temperature of 105 °C;
Durability projected for 6,000 h;
Pt efficiency up to 15 A/mg @0.66 V;

Hydrogen is considered to play an essential role in future zero-emissions Heavy Duty (HD) mobility. There is a growing consensus that (long haul) HD transport and HD stationary will be the key market for hydrogen Fuel Cells (FC) from the mid-2020s onwards. In addition, this transport sector struggles with the electrification of their portfolio. A large element is considered to be the consequence of theimpact on the production and supply chain, and the workshop and parts organisation. The complexity of the system as such is seen as too large of an obstacle.
Hydrogen has proven to be a serious alternative for (large) batteries, but TCO has to be reduced in order to reach a competitive level. Standard sized sub-systems are considered to be an important part of reaching this level of competitiveness. Standard sizes will improve reliability, parts availability, competition in the supply chain and above all a critical mass. These elements will also substantially lower the threshold for OEM’s and end users to adopt hydrogen as alternative for batteries.
The next step is real-world operation with heavy duty applications such as buses, trucks, trains, and ships in daily operation, all based upon the same technology and using the same supply chain to create a critical mass. Instead of demonstrating the technology, it is paramount to make FC applications economically feasible, by reaching ‘economy of scale’. This means FC system prices per kW and hydrogen prices per kg have to be reduced significantly by 3 to 5 times vs current levels. These figures are based on different TCO calculations (Euro/km or Euro/kg) which include all parameters (like operation and maintenance, lifetime etc.). To achieve 'economy of scale' with FC systems, they have to be standard sized and multi-purpose (not dedicated to only bus, truck or stationary). A standard size will be of benefit for the FC system supplier as well as for the FC system user. ‘Economy of Scale’ and ‘Fair Competition’ are the keywords for making hydrogen mobility economically feasible. In line with this, the challenge for this topic is based on three principles:
Hydrogen FC + BoP within a standard sized module (AA-Battery principle);
Hydrogen-Electric mobility for HD (> 3.5 ton) and long haul transport (off-road, rail, water). HD requires efficient, flexible, available, reliable, durable, robust and widely serviceable solutions (according to the defined KPI’s);
Hydrogen-Electric mobility TCO comparable (max +30%) with non-zero emission HD TCO.
Scope:
The standard for the size, connections, Application Programming Interface (API) protocol and general test procedures of this FC module “frame” should be defined. Depending on the different HD market legislations, different options on the FC module “cover” could be implemented. This definition should be done no later than the end of project month 12 with an associated go/no-go decision gate on the following development to which at least 7 FC suppliers should commit to make their FC conform to this standard as part of this go/no go decision milestone:
At least 7 FC suppliers and 3 OEMs from at least two different HDV application sectors should participate in the standard definition process;
The FC module should be around 30 to 100 kW net (max 1 stack power is 100-125 kW gross);
The FC module should be specified so that it can be scaled up (as LEGO) to a minimum power level of 1 MW;
The FC module should include at least the FC stack, the air supply system and the cooling/heating system without radiator;
The maximum 3 standard mechanical size(s) should be equivalent to the common battery pack systems or the available space in the different HD applications. This should be done to make switching between full electric and FC applications more modular and cost effective;
A minimum of 7 FC suppliers develop, build and commit their standard sized FC + BoP module according to the agreed standard (although FC stack development might be part of project, will not be considered within the scope of the topic and therefore not supported by funding).
These FCs should be tested by an independent organisation according to an agreed protocol; the FC modules should be validated, according to an agreed test protocol, as whole FC module to make technical comparison between the different FC module suppliers easier for the different HD customers, without infringing the FC module supplier’s Intellectual Property (IP). The testing should be done on an independent reference test device.
The scope should also include some essential and critical aspects:
To define and specify together with the FC system suppliers and HD customers an International Standard module size, connections, API, test protocols and requirements for different HD applications;
To define possible approaches on how to operate the modular systems in series/parallel up to a minimum of 1MW;
To build standard sized FC modules from at least seven different FC suppliers (minimum five of them should be from EU);
To develop and build a FC system reference test device for these modules, for testing on location and dynamically, by an independent organisation;
To test the FC module(s) on the independent reference test device to get comparable/reproducible results and test the module also for durability purposes.
The ultimate goal is to go from relatively small FC suppliers, each with their own specific customers/markets to a global FC module market with a larger choice of different suppliers for a wide range of new HD applications. This ‘Standard sized FC-module’ will also lower the threshold for industries that have not yet considered hydrogen as an energy source (due to scale, limited R&D budgets etc.). The FC system should evolve from a High-Tech experimental product today to a common easy to integrate energy module in a wide range of HD applications tomorrow.
TRL at start of the project: 5 and TRL at the end of the project: 6-7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 7.5 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
The aim of the topic is to create a plug-and-play FC module that can take the ‘Hydrogen Economy’ out of the vicious circle and into 'Economy of Scale'. Some overall expected impacts could be:
Economy of Scale (Stack and BoP) and Fair Competition (by reducing TCO);
Expected increase in sales, markets and applications including easier logistics for parts and services;
A standard sized module which will further optimize (simplify) the FC system design and manufacturability; investments in developments and automated production can be justified;
Future technology improvements can be made and easily integrated without big changes on the application side (size and interfacing);
The user application can be designed to the needed power by adding extra FC modules and without to be bounded to a specific FC system supplier;
The FC module specifications can be described using agreed and validated test protocols;
The FC module can be used as H2-Range Extender or as H2-Hybrid now or later as upgrade;
When more than 1 FC module is used, availability through redundancy can be achieved; the plug-and-play requirement should reduce the operational downtime to a minimum by swopping units; specialists repair can be centralized.
As the maximum 3 standard size(s) and connections are to be defined:
The FC module supplier and the HD customers can independently from each other develop their Zero Emission product/application;
The HD customers can freely and easily switch between the FC module suppliers;
No FC module supplier should need to share any of their IP; all the IP is inside their FC module:
Inside the module the FC system supplier will use its own IP while outside it is a standard sized plug-and-play module;
New developments and optimisation of the FC module can be done within these agreed specifications without changing the HD application itself.
Standard sized modules will contribute by the fact that developments will shift from technology into applications (based on modules and high volumes) and thus should accelerate the use of hydrogen, resulting also in the needed reduction of costs. The end goal is to make hydrogen for Heavy Duty applications economical viable without funding’s in the next 5-10 years.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Increased productivity powered by renewable energy sources is the primary motivation for the adoption of fuel cell and hydrogen technology in the material handling (MH) and industrial vehicles, e.g. municipal service trucks, markets. Regulations for indoor operations of vehicles and emission regulations for environmental zones in cities generate an increasing demand for zero emission drives for industrial mobile applications.
Promotion of both European based technology and commercialisation of hydrogen and fuel cells for industrial mobile applications are urgently required. Demonstrations MH vehicles fleets applying the latest fuel cell technologies should on one hand prove performance and reliability inducing customer acceptance and on the other hand enable cost reductions in fuel cell system and hydrogen infrastructure.
This demonstration project further aims, on one hand, to deploy, promote and benchmark the EU MH and industrial vehicle FC technology and value chain and on the other hand to evaluate the European market.
The topic is not intended to cover basic R&D on new FC systems. Demonstration shall comprise 400 or more fuel cell MH and industrial vehicle units across multiple vehicle-user sites and applications aimed at proving a commercial customer value proposition. Demonstration should include necessary and relevant support of small-scale and low-cost hydrogen supply infrastructure designed for 35 MPa and the hydrogen generated should be from renewable energy.
Proposals should include installations with typical fleet sizes of 10 to 30 MHVs per site which represents the majority of installations in the EU and in at least 6 sites. However large fleets with 100+ MHVs in one site can also be considered.
This demonstration project therefore aims, on one hand, to deploy, promote and benchmark the EU MH and industrial vehicle FC technology and value chain and on the other hand to evaluate the European market (in at least 6 different sites).
Scope:
The project must cover the deployment and evaluation of an European FC system technology by vehicle-users in real operating environments of a series of at least 400 MHVs and industrial vehicles and the related infrastructure. The FC vehicles are to be implemented in different sites of logistic hubs, municipal service hubs, airports, etc. Projects are expected to cover top-level requirements and criteria for industrial-scale adoption and market entry such as:
Performance:
Optimised operating strategy for application specific drive cycle / load cycle (drive cycle efficiency, start/stop cycling)
Operation under application specific indoor / outdoor environmental conditions including cold / freezing ambient conditions, freeze start capability @ -20°C on system level
98% availability in the fleet
> 10.000h stack lifetime in the field @ > 40 % end-of-life system efficiency
LCA (cradle to grave) of environmental performance of vehicles, infrastructure and energy source
Safety:
FC systems eligible for funding have to address specific European safety standards such as EN 62282-2:2012 Fuel cell technologies - Part 2: Fuel cell modules and EN 62282-4-101:2014 FC Systems Industrial Trucks Safety or EC79/2009 Hydrogen-powered Motor Vehicles as well as have to be CE marked or certified according to applicable EU directives for off-road and on-road vehicles and implements.
Safety criteria and concepts for indoor operation and refueling of trucks as basis for standardization shall be developed
Competitiveness (on TCO basis) in comparison to state of the art technologies (ICE, LA / LI battery):
Competitiveness to competing technology is to be achieved in the fleet per site;
Fuel @ 35 MPa
FCH JU project funding covers technology costs (FC systems, H2 infrastructure) which exceed state of the art technology on TCO basis (funding will take away vehicle-users risks of new technology and help ramp-up supplier volumes)
TCO comparison shall include investment, maintenance and service expenses, hydrogen consumption, disposal
The minimum operational period for any vehicle demonstrated in the project has to be at least 24 months. Project proposal evaluation benefits if synergies by using 35 / 70 MPa HRS implemented within the project also for other types of fuel cell vehicles like trucks, vans, cars, etc.
The focus of this topic is the demonstration of fuel cell system technology, including stack and BOP components, developed and manufactured in the EU.
Indicative funding:
The fuel cell system manufacturer / supplier should be in the position to offer the fuel cell systems to vehicle-users at a price that enables the user to reduce risks of operation. The funding per FC system may not exceed the maximum funding as defined in the following table:
System continuous power out put
Maximum funding in €
<3 kW
6,500
3 - 8 kW
11,500
8 -15 kW
15,000
>15 kW
20,000
Similarly, the installation costs of hydrogen infrastructure enabling the on-site production and supply of “green hydrogen” at a fuel demand <30 kgH2/d @ 35 MPa are eligible for funding. The funding per site may, however, not exceed 250,000 €.
The consortium should be representative for an European FC technology value chain including FC system integrators, FC system components suppliers (stacks, power electronics …), H2 infrastructure suppliers, MH and industrial vehicle OEMs and different vehicle-users.
End-users should be partner in the consortium or committing themselves to demonstrate a minimum of 200 MH and industrial vehicles at the start of the project. The commitment shall be secured by way of pre-orders or similar before signature of the Grant Agreement.
Techno-economic and environmental assessment of the project should be performed.
FC systems at commencement must be at least TRL 7 and targets TRL 8 or higher at the end of the project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).

Fuel cell based power generation has a valuable business case for off-grid power generation in certain special markets such as powering the gas and oil infrastructure in remote regions with harsh climate conditions (-40 to +50 °C) and the continuous power supplies of telecommunication equipment (e.g. telecom base stations). This market is dominated by diesel generators today in accessible regions and by thermoelectric generators with very low efficiency in very remote areas. Both of these solutions have high environmental impact. Fuel cell based systems due to their higher efficiency and low maintenance requirements can offer significant primary energy and carbon savings and can significantly lower the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the end user as well as offering. These application areas provide very promising export markets for the European fuel cell industry.
Several European fuel cell companies are already addressing this market with solutions for niche applications in low volume. In order to enter high volume applications (i.e. the rapidly growing telecom sector in several emerging markets) further cost reductions are needed on both of stack and the specific Balance of Plant components.
Applications in remote areas are characterized by other key requirements: low maintenance, long service life of components, capability of remote monitoring and reliable operation in critical applications like oil and gas or safety infrastructure both in cold and in hot regions. Besides typical fuel cell components like stacks and reformers also several balance of plant (BOP) components such as electronic equipment, blowers, gas metering, sensors have to be specifically designed. They need to match the needs of reliable and rugged long term performance in order to provide long lasting, low maintenance products for remote applications. This provides an opportunity of a joint supply of the specific Balance of Plant components for remote operation by the European system manufacturers. This can increase the volume of such low-volume specialised items (tolerance to wide operating temperatures, high humidity).
Although first products have touched the market in prototype and pre-series state, currently the lack of long-term track records together with the high CAPEX, due to high cost of stacks and certain critical BOP equipment (i.e. power electronics, electronics suitable for low temperatures) provide a barrier for a large scale roll-out of fuel cell based power generators.
Scope:
The project should develop and demonstrate the next generation system products in gas and oil infrastructures in remote regions (monitoring and communication, control of block and gate valves, corrosion protection, etc.) and possibly the telecommunication towers power supply that grows fast in emerging countries. Both applications have a typical power need in the range of 0.5 to 5 kW under harsh climate conditions.
The manufacturers’ solutions should provide products meeting all relevant requirements for remote power generation in potentially harsh climate conditions and develop technological strategies in order to close the gap between prototypes and pre-series manufacturing to a commodity.
Applicants should demonstrate firm commitment from end-users, through conditional orders or direct participation in the consortium during the application phase. In addition, projects should involve all relevant parties from the end user side such as gas and oil companies, telecommunication tower operators, telecommunication companies, fuel cell manufacturers and ideally suppliers of critical Balance of Plant components.

Applicants should also focus on the following targets.

Technical:
Provide next generations of FC based systems for remote power supply that consider local/regional requirements to provide global products with regionally adapted solutions that match normative requirements like CE marking or other standards. This includes:
For the application in cold areas, the ability to start-up systems from -40°C from Natural Gas or from -15°C for LPG;
The fuel cell based systems demonstrate significantly higher efficiency compared to diesel generators with an AC electrical efficiency above 30% (LHV);
A design of BOP components should be realized for a broad range of climate conditions, which can be made available for different manufacturers. The projects should identify critical BOP components and where possible define common standards to generate synergies in the supply chain. Component suppliers are encouraged to participate in the projects to engineer and validate their solutions;
The broad applicability should be validated and demonstrated in a large field test, in order to verify the reliable operation (24/7/365 over 24 months). The intervals for proactive maintenance should be more than 12 months;
The service lifetime should be comparable to established solutions and life cycle costs should be lower than those of competing solutions. As necessary, further strategies for life cycle cost reduction should be developed;
The use of locally available fuels e.g. natural gas (from gas pipeline) or other relevant fuels should be demonstrated;
Remote system access and diagnosis plus smart service and maintenance concepts should be implemented;
Conceptual:
Transform the prototype manufacturing into a concept for serial production, where reproducibility of production stages and availability of larger quantities are realised. Maintainability and reparability of components have to be improved in order enable local, less educated personal to do it within short time at low cost.
Gain relevant statistical data for availability, degradation and service cost that will enable manufacturers to build guarantee and service contract concepts for end-customers.
Economical:
The transfer from prototype to series production needs to reduce the balance of plant component costs by at least 30% for prototypes or be compatible with conventional series production where available through a technology platform approach. This involves value engineering e.g. simplification of the generator structure and modularization of the system and scale effects in the manufacturing process.
Identify markets and needs for the distribution of the product and adapt it to specific requirements, if necessary. Search for existing networks of potential customers; possibly recruit local distributors for the marketing, sales, installation, commissioning and service.
The above-mentioned targets should be validated and demonstrated in a field test of pipeline and telecommunication applications by at least 3 stack manufacturers or fuel cell integrators with at least total 15 units in the power range of 0.5 to 5 kWe. Applicants should demonstrate a total sum of system electrical power capacity of at least 15 kW.
TRL at start: 5 and TRL at end: 7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
International collaboration with countries under International Partnership of Hydrogen into the Economy (IPHE) is specifically encouraged for this topic.

A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 4 years.
Expected Impact:
Strengthening and growth of the European value chain for FC technologies by capitalising and seizing the large export market opportunity that fuel cell based remote power generation provides;
Introduction of technology to niche markets for approval and demonstration at international customers’ sites under real conditions such as oil and gas companies in e.g. North America and Europe, Asia and MEA will provide the base for long term experience to gain customer trust and for further cost reduction;
This will enable to grow the application range to further markets with larger volume potential of several 1000 new installations per year in the telecom sector only in Asia, where usually no landlines will be installed and instead of that, cell phone communication will be established exclusively with increasing energy demand for internet services via mobile devices;
Increase of trust towards new customer groups and improvement in the visibility as reliable and long lasting technology in the energy market, by demonstrations in relevant field environments in collaboration with stakeholders from other industry segments e.g. gas- and oil industry or telecommunication industry;
A cost reduction of minimum 30% by means of value engineering and serial manufacturing technologies for systems and core system parts and use of standardized BOP components;
Providing improved energy efficiency products with early commercial viability will contribute to the economic viability of fuel cell products overall and to the creation of a Tier level industrial structure allowing transferring scale effects to other applications;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There is increased penetration of various intermittent (electric) power generation sources in combination with a shift towards fossil-free hydrogen from power. This combination requires back-up solutions during dark doldrums, for a reliable continuous supply of electric power as well as renewable hydrogen.
Tackling this challenge by coupling the industrial, power, heat and mobility sectors by using reversible Solid Oxide Cell (SOC) technology integrated into existing infrastructures allows to achieve this with high flexibility at low cost. SOC have the ability to provide adequate energy transformation processes as required by the overall energy system situation, both storing or generating electricity while assuring continuous hydrogen supply, e.g. for critical processes. For example, a polygeneration system has the ability to provide hydrogen from electricity in the electrolysis (SOE) mode or from methane when no electricity is available (SOFC mode). In the latter case, the system also provides electricity and heat, usually adequately with demand.
Various projects such as GrInHy and CH2P are already addressing the constitutive basic blocks to build polygeneration systems such as the Solid Oxide membrane reactor, reformers, and shift reactors. Within these projects, the systems demonstrate different sub-sets of a polygeneration system but not the entire scope. In order to achieve reversible polygeneration for continuous hydrogen supply, the thermal integration, fast and save mode changes as well as a lower cost and efficient gas downstream processing present the main challenges. A high system efficiency in the various modes is required to deliver economical attractive solutions and needs to be balanced with proper component dimensioning to avoid excessive costs.
The challenge also includes the identification of specific use cases where an appropriate payback on the investment cost can be expected associated to a sufficient market volume to allow adequate cost reduction. Such cases are expected to be found in mobility applications with seasonality of renewable electricity supply (hydro, solar) and for chemical processes but might be found also in other domains. Setup of business models that allow demand driven secured supply of low-carbon hydrogen and power from distributed specific points, such as in transport or grid serving, especially pathways allowing stepping forward quickly on the market with limited or no subsidies.
Scope:
The project should develop, engineer, build a polygeneration system and test/operate it for 5,000 hours in a real industrial or mobility environment. It is expected that every mode should be operated for at least 20% of the total operating time. The polygeneration system should also meet the following criteria:
Electrolysis output > 20 kg/day;
LHV-based efficiency in electrolysis mode > 75%;
LHV-based efficiency in fuel cell mode >75% accounting H2 LHV, electricity and useful heat or 70% accounting H2 LHV and electricity;
Part load operation capability as low as 30% for hydrogen production;
Transient operation capability and reverse cycle time of <30 minutes;
Degradation <0.5%/khrs on H2 production and electricity efficiency, including mode and thermal cycling at constant hydrogen output (or equivalent as adequate to the specific use case).
The system design and construction should be based on component modelling and testing to better understand and enhance degradation and performance in different operational modes.
The project should also cover the development of a demand and operational model, ensuring that “CertifHy Green H2“ or “CertifHy Low-Carbon H2” guarantees of origin are issued through the CertifHy platform to ensure that the hydrogen production is renewable or low-carbon depending on the operation mode. The flexibility of polygeneration should ensure that the demand side for hydrogen does not have to follow the supply side of renewable electricity.
The operational model should consider the market constraints such as electricity and ‘grey’ hydrogen prices, access to capacity markets etc. and lead into a profitable business model. If a profitable business model is not possible, the obstacles towards profitability should be identified and communicated.
Depending on the environment, syngas (CO + H2) can be an alternative to pure H2.

Expected Impact:
Polygeneration systems will provide continuous renewable and low carbon hydrogen and ensure a fast and reliable path for the deployment of hydrogen use. The project should therefore expected to have the following impacts:
Demonstration of secure year-round green or low carbon H2 availability of over 90% for hydrogen dependent processes, also during dark doldrums;
Year round hydrogen availability and polygeneration assuring maximum annual capacity utilization reducing thereby the specific CAPEX (i.e., CAPEX per kg of H2 or kWh electricity) is reduced to <5,000 €/(kg H2/day) at an annual system manufacturing volume corresponding to 40,000 kg/day;
Replacement of carbon intensive steam reformers and hydrogen-logistics with reduction of >60% in CO2 emission per kg of produced hydrogen;
Cost effectiveness with targets of 3.50 €/kg H2 (@40 €/MWhel) and 5.00 €/kg (@80 €/MWhel);
Offer lower cost and low carbon foot print system for distributed supply of hydrogen accelerating the rollout of hydrogen infrastructure in transport;
Removal of the need for expensive back-up systems for hydrogen supply for the generation of hydrogen from renewable sources, allowing the highly flexible system to couple the different sectors of electricity, industry, mobility and heat; this flattens peak prices caused by the compensation of fluctuation/intermittency, a major bottleneck as of today;
Providing additional volumes of stack manufacturing in this application and supporting the volume-driven cost reduction path in further fields of application such as SOE and cogeneration.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
High temperature Solid Oxide Electrolysers (SOE) are the most promising solution for efficient and cost-effective hydrogen production and storage/re-use of intermittent electricity from renewable sources. The integration of SOE stacks with balance of plant components proved the successful use of these systems, however, coupling with real intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) is still a big challenge. Due to the intermittent nature of RES, using them to power SOE systems is expected to require substantial transient operation capability from the SOEs, which can induce high stress onto the stack and system as compared to steady state operation, resulting in thermal issues and degradation worsening.
As compared to other electrolysis technologies, SOE offers two specificities. The first one is the reversible operation (rSOC), meaning the possibility to operate in electrolysis mode to produce hydrogen when an excess of intermittent renewable energy is available, and in fuel cell mode to produce electricity from hydrogen previously produced when electricity available stands below the demand. Depending on the use case, a large number of cycles between electrolysis and fuel cell mode will have to be performed over the lifetime of the rSOC system (at least one per day). The time to switch from one mode to the other can be in the range of 20 minutes or below. It has been found recently in ongoing EU/FCH 2 JU projects that such an operation can induce accelerated degradation compared to stationary SOFC or SOE operation. So far, the exact mechanism behind this acceleration is not well understood. The second specificity of SOE is its ability to electrolyse not only steam but also CO2, and as a consequence the possibility to co-electrolyse steam and CO2 to produce syngas (H2+CO mixture), which can subsequently be used for the production of synthesis molecules (gaseous or liquid). As compared to pure SOE operation, the co-electrolysis (so-called co-SOE) can induce additional degradation due to the presence of carbon, in addition to the dynamic and transient operation also needed for this technology.
Consequently, careful and coordinated control actions during transient manoeuvres, which may occur when coupling (co-)SOEs with RES or rSOC operation are therefore needed. It is key to first identify the specific consequences of dynamic operation at stack and system level, and then to develop methods to detect and finally counteract related issues with simple and cost-efficient methods. Subsequently, BoP control actions are to be developed to i) guarantee smooth transient operations during mode shift operations and ii) select proper working points to optimize performance, keeping durability and availability in the planned maintenance timeframe.
Scope:
Several previous monitoring, diagnostic and control projects were performed in the field of SOFC in the last years e.g. DESIGN, DIAMOND and INSIGHT [53]. They developed and validated monitoring and diagnostic techniques ranging from processing conventional signals to advanced techniques like Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), with both conventional sinewave excitation and PRBS (pseudorandom binary sequence signal) and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and diagnostic algorithms for Detection and Isolation of faults (FDI). In order to embed in a real SOFC system, the developed monitoring, diagnostic and lifetime tools described above, specific hardware has been developed.
The topic aims at developing the same approach on SOE (possibly including co-SOE) and/or rSOC stacks and systems, with the aim to increase lifetime of stack and availability of systems operated dynamically. To establish the ranges of dynamic operation (frequency, amplitude and occurrence of reactant, power and heat ratios involved) the most promising process chains should be considered, as determined e.g. in the H2020 project BALANCE [54] or motivated by recorded industrial assessment.
The project should cover the following:
Enhance the understanding of (co-)SOE and/or rSOC stack degradation mechanisms in representative operating conditions of intermittent electricity supply and/or rSOC cycles using both experimental and modelling approaches;
Assess system capabilities:
For rSOC operation to switch from one mode to the other with the appropriate dynamics (time scale, hydrogen or syngas production volume, electricity - and possibly heat) production, etc.);
For (co-)SOE operation to cope with fluctuating electricity input in terms of thermal management (time scale, hydrogen or syngas production volume, down-stream processes, etc.);
Identify suitable stack and system level monitoring parameters which indicate a possible critical state of the (co-)SOE and/or rSOC stack/module within the system, using advanced monitoring techniques like EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and using both sinusoidal and PRBS (pseudo random binary signal) stimuli) complemented by THD (total harmonic distortion) and/or DRT (distribution of relaxation time) analysis in addition to conventional signals (temperature, pressure, flow rate etc.);
Develop the algorithms able to perform the diagnostics and to determine the remaining useful lifetime depending on the state of health of the stack/module;
Develop the hardware for the implementation of these advanced Monitoring, Diagnostic and Lifetime tools, able to interact with the power electronics of the system to apply counteractions;
Develop control devices and strategies to keep performance, and improve durability and availability of stacks and systems;
Demonstrate the diagnostic approach and the developed hardware for monitoring and lifetime prediction, and to validate the control strategy and devices in a relevant environment with (co-SOE) and/or rSOC stacks or stack modules;
Develop a physical product, embedding the software tools, evaluate the TCO (total cost of ownership) of this product and propose routes for exploitation of the solutions developed.
Taking advantage of previous SOFC projects in this research area, the project should start with TRL 4 and conclude at TRL 6.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell or electrolyser components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2.5 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected Impact:
Development of a monitoring and diagnostic tool, also able to evaluate remaining useful lifetime and to propose counteractions to the (co-)SOEC or rSOC stack/system. This will contribute to improve the durability, reliability and availability of those systems, thus reducing their TCO and accelerating their market penetration. The most relevant degradation mechanisms in (co-)SOE or rSOC stacks/systems for specific market segments will be identified and analysed with respect to impact on lifetime, such as fatal impact or slow decrease of performances.
Monitoring parameters will be determined that reveal the State-of-Health of (co-)SOE and/or rSOC stacks regarding those identified critical mechanisms.
Counter measures to prevent fatal (co-)SOE or rSOC stack failure should be proposed, including possible regular treatments that prevent or slow-down long-term degradation, with a target of (co-) SOE and/or rSOC stack lifetime increase by 5%, allowing to reach a production loss rate of 1.2%/1,000h and an availability increase by 3% to reach a value of 98% (in agreement with the MAWP target in 2024 [55]).
It should be demonstrated that the added cost of this monitoring/diagnostics approach does not increase the overall system manufacturing costs by more than 3%, and contribute to achieve the reduction of the operation and maintenance cost by 10%, to reach a value of €120/(kg/d)/y in agreement with the MAWP target in 2024.
A physical product, embedding the software tools should be developed. An evaluation of the TCO (total cost of ownership) should be done, to assess the benefit of installing such a tool in SOE systems, with a target to improve the TCO of a SOE of 15%, thanks to the increase of the maintenance interval and the minimization of the stack replacement as compared to a system not equipped with this tool. Accordingly, an exploitation roadmap should be defined at the end of the project.

High temperature fuel cells are typically used to produce power and heat from natural gas or bio-methane at high efficiency. In this process, a hydrogen containing syngas is often produced as an intermediate step.
The specific challenge of this topic is to convert part of this syngas into a hydrogen stream, while maintaining the high efficiency of the overall system. The system would thus supply power, hydrogen and possibly heat, with flexibility to modulate between these products to cope with changing demand.
The results of a project should enable the development of a distributed hydrogen production system and stationary applications.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Over the past years, electrolysers have demonstrated their high flexibility and potential to deliver grid balancing services as a flexible load. Due to its variable character and increasing penetration, the integration of wind energy is becoming more challenging in Europe especially in weak power grids.
Locating an electrolyser inside the fence of a wind park presents potentially many advantages such as the smoothing of the power output (feed-in) of the wind park, the optimization of power management between the two technologies, the avoidance of (transmission and distribution) grid costs on the power used by the electrolyser, a clear renewable character of the hydrogen produced from wind power, the possibility to develop new operating strategies in order to maximize the energy production from wind turbines (curtailment avoidance) and to experiment new types of combined grid services.
The specific challenge of the topic is to achieve a full and efficient integration between the wind power generation systems and the capacity of hydrogen generation through electrolysers in a new and highly integrated layout.
Scope:
This topic aims at demonstrating an electrolyser in combination with an existing wind turbine or wind park. The electrolyser should be located inside the fence of a wind park and deliver balancing services through improved grid stabilising features of the wind turbine – electrolyser integration upstream of the wind park transformer.
Within the project, the smart energy management system and the necessary controls will be developed to operate the wind park and the electrolyser in the most optimal way, exploiting technical and economical synergies. The project should include the development of an advanced control system with power set points to combine the volatility of the wind park and the flexibility of the electrolyser. This control system should also consider economical parameters such as the provision of grid balancing services, the hydrogen demand profile for the selected application and the optimization of the economics of the whole plant (wind power sale and hydrogen sale).
The project should further demonstrate:
A state of the art, fast response electrolyser of at least 2MW with a CAPEX @ rated power below 3 M€/tpd;
A successful operation for a cumulated duration of at least 2 years and the cumulated production of at least 100 tons of hydrogen;
Its ability to meet at least one of the following targets:
smoothen the power output of the wind turbine (or wind farm) significantly with the aim that:
a) the energy can better be integrated in the trading of electricity; or
b) the power system operator allows to increase the overall penetration with volatile sources, such as wind.
capture revenues in combination with the wind park for the provision of grid services, such as primary, secondary and tertiary response markets, or other electrical services that a power system operator is willing to pay for.
the technical and economic benefit of having an integrated concept.
A significant part of the hydrogen produced during the project should be valorised, sold for example to a customer (industrial or mobility), injected in a natural gas or hydrogen grid or re-electrified. The downstream costs associated with the hydrogen use (outside the fence) are not considered eligible for funding under this topic by the FCH JU.
Furthermore, the project shall provide:
a detailed analysis of the business case for the direct connection of electrolysers with wind farms as well as a market outlook for such an integrated concept;
a technical and economic analysis covering the further integration of electrolyser technologies with wind turbines (or wind parks) in several key configurations (e.a.: dedicated wind turbine for hydrogen production, off-shore hydrogen production from wind energy);
an analysis of the environmental performance of the integrated system;
an impact analysis on the European energy system and the potential impact of this concept on regulations, codes and standards.
The technology should be moved from TRL 4 to TRL 6 with respect to the balance of plant and the system integration with the wind park. The consortium should include at least a wind farm operator, an electrolyser manufacturer and a grid operator.
International collaboration in this field is highly encouraged, especially with IPHE members.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).

the economic and technical synergies between electrolysers and wind power parks and the overall benefits for the technology developers, the project owners and the grid operators;
the integration of both technologies could generate more benefits than the sum of the two technologies at two different sites.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Carbon-free hydrogen production from water decomposition pathways powered by solar energy is a major part of the long-term R&D strategy of the FCH 2 JU for sustainable hydrogen supply. Thermochemical processes require less energy conversion steps for hydrogen production by renewable energy compared to electrochemical processes. Therefore, they have the potential to be more efficient.
Solar thermo-chemical cycles are capable to directly transfer concentrated sunlight into chemical energy by a series of chemical reactions. Based on concentrated solar radiation technologies the processes can be scaled-up to very large scale exceeding 100 MWth. Recent solar thermochemical research has focused on metal oxide based and sulphur based thermochemical cycles since they have the highest potential to be competitive, practicable and scalable up to an industrial level.
The success of those processes is often strongly linked to the availability of materials and components with the required properties. The performance of the current materials, mainly redox materials and catalysts is limiting the production rate of hydrogen in a concentrated solar power reactor. Sufficient heat can be introduced in the solar reactor. However, the mass transfer to the reactive surface, the heat transfer to and between the reactants and the chemical conversion rate of steam to hydrogen is limited by the properties and structure of the adsorbent materials currently available. Therefore, smart technical solutions are needed for material properties and structures on the one hand and for solar interfaces, reactor designs and for fluids consumption and handling on the other hand. Highly efficient components of the solar receiver/reactor unit as well as of the heat recovery unit are essential to achieve the required overall process efficiencies.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on improving performances and looking for compatible target costs of the final technology Improving performance and reduce cost of thermochemical hydrogen production from concentrated sunlight. New solutions of components and overall system should be validated in the field.
The project proposal should address the following elements:
Improve the stability, cyclability and performance of functional materials for high temperature water splitting; in many cases a suitably tailored microstructural design of reactor materials shows promise to overcome some of the challenges; these suitable materials need to exhibit sufficient stability and activity over at least 1000 cycles or 5000 hours of operation;
Design novel solutions for high temperature solid-solid and solid-gas heat recovery. This is of utmost importance to achieve highly efficient processes. Ca. 5 % are reported as the highest solar to fuel efficiencies of state of the art processes. To get closer to competitiveness such value needs to be doubled. Heat recovery rates substantially higher than 50 % are requested to meet that target;
Design of highly efficient solar interfaces and reactors. High efficiencies are often bound to high reaction rates achievable through smart material solutions and fluids handling;
Provide suitable and robust materials and design solutions for plant components with high thermal loads. The temperatures of the key components are very high. To provide such components ensuring lifetimes of more than 10.000 hours is crucial. Demonstration of long-term performance of materials and key components under realistic boundary conditions using existing solar test facilities is needed. A representative and meaningful demonstration will be possible with core components like the solar receiver in a scale of about 500 kW. The testing period of the hardware should be of a relevant and representative duration, for a period of minimum 6 months;
Design and development of intelligent systems and a smart process of control and automation, including predictive and self-learning tools;
Embed and validate smart solutions to minimize the consumption of auxiliaries like flushing gas. Target should be to reduce energy losses through such auxiliaries to less than 25 % of the energy output;
Comparative potential benchmarked analyses assessing the technical and economic viability prospects of the technology towards benchmark other processes needs to be refined based on state-of-the-art materials, components and processes;
TRL at start: 3 and TRL at end: 5.
The proposal should build on previous FCH 2 JU projects' results on related processes and should seek intensive cooperation with European and national projects dealing with thermochemical fuel production; cooperation with Mission Innovation challenge 5 (‘Converting Sunlight’) [20] is encouraged.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 - 4 years.
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to advance the knowledge and prove the technological feasibility of the concept of solar thermochemical water splitting including the environmental, social and economic benefits. The proposal should show its contribution towards building a sustainable renewable energy system contributing to the decarbonisation of our economies. The proposed solutions are expected to contribute to strengthening the EU leadership on renewables. In the case of solar-thermochemical water splitting this will be achieved through proving the feasibility and performance of key materials and key components needed to carry out the process in relevant scale.
The consortium will ensure that following actions are included in the project to fulfil to the planned target and reach the KPIs, such as:
The process should be demonstrated at realistic scale and working conditions, ideally using an existing solar demonstration facility (>2 hundred-kW range);
The process and plant behaviour should be validated through medium to long-term operation;
Finalization of a design and development of a technology with annual solar-to-fuel efficiencies in the range efficiency of 10 % (ratio of solar radiation entering the plant to calorific value of the fuel exiting the plant), doubling the state-of-the-art efficiency for processes with about 5 %;
Demonstration of at least 5 % efficiency in the field tests;
Achieving of heat recovery rates of high temperature heat in excess of 60 %;
Achieving a process strategy allowing full automation.
These are needed to establish solar thermochemical water splitting as a completive technology for suitable sites and to contribute to achieve economic competitiveness to hydrogen production through PV or CSP powered electrolysis.
The project results should contribute to an increased decarbonisation of the transport sector, to a reduced dependency on fossil fuels and to a reduction of emission of air pollutants. The project should create significant visibility to the potential of applying solar thermal energy for fuel and in particular hydrogen production.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Solid Oxide Cells (SOC) have historically been developed for the conversion of gas into power, known as Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). In the context of the energy transition with more intermittent renewable energy sources and efforts to decarbonise entire industry sectors such as steel and the chemical industry, Solid Oxide Cells see potential applications in a much wider scope. The same base set of materials can cover Solid Oxide Electrolysers (SOE) for hydrogen production or for the production of syngas (co-electrolysis of steam and CO2, co-SOE), or for renewable energies storage (reversible electrolysis/fuel cell mode, rSOC), and further operating modes are envisioned in the context of sector coupling in the energy field.
Today’s set of materials has been optimised for the historically longest-standing application, the SOFC. The additional use modes challenge the current material and microstructural sets, opening the door for new materials and processes not commonly applied in the SOC industry. The challenge is to address a large scope of materials, appropriate microstructures and manufacturing processes for SOC and to integrate them into stacks to reach an optimum (trade-off) in terms of performance, durability, reliability and cost.
Scope:
The objective of the topic is to propose the next generation of cells and stacks for the various SOC related applications, including new materials, architectures and associated manufacturing processes. It should consider several operating modes, SOE and rSOC modes being mandatory and co-SOE or any other operating modes optional.
The potential proposal should focus on the development of new concepts of cells (electrodes, interfaces, architectures) in terms of innovative materials and related production processes for their integration into stacks, targeting the following improvements without compromising the other targets included in the MAWP:
Improvement of cell/stack long-term stability and reliability while maintaining their performance for SOE, co-SOE or rSOC operation, potentially for pressurized operation or at lower operating temperatures. To this respect particular attention should be given to the development of manufacturing processes able to control microstructural properties of electrodes and interfaces;
Allowing, thermal and load cycling as required for the aforementioned applications; in particular the possibility of recovery or self-healing options as well as increased resilience strategies should be considered;
Decreasing the use of high cost and critical raw materials (CRM), promoting environmentally friendly processes: smart use of raw materials, e.g. aqueous solutions rather than organic based solvents, use of non-toxic organic additives, zero or low amount of wastes in the process, recycling and/or based on eco-designed manufacturing processes, reducing the energy intensity of the whole process;
Selecting at least 10 concepts, materials, and the related processes suitably controlling their microstructure able to cope with future industrial needs (e.g. should be industrially scalable for mass production, at low cost, compatible with the size requested for stacks). The new materials that can be considered in the project should have already proven a performance and stability not lower than 70% of the reference state of the art materials in at least one relevant testing conditions (SOE/rSOC/Co-SOE operation).
The potential project should address:
Validation of the developments on cells with > 50 cm² of active area and at short stack scale (≥ 5 cells) considering a stack design already available;
Durability improvement, demonstrated with tests above 2,000h for single cells, above 1,000h for short-stacks in conditions representative of the application;
For the most promising solutions developed in the present project, a long-term durability test at stack level above 5,000h should be performed;
An environmental assessment of the proposed cell designs as compared to the state-of-the-art cell design. This assessment should be carried out according to the requirements in the FC-HyGuide guidance document (http://www.fc-hyguide.eu/guidance-document.html).
The project should rely mainly on existing test-infrastructure, while additional support in test infrastructure could only cover new operating modes. Investment in new test facilities needs to be justified by additional requirements for specific operating mode, not covered by the conventional equipment. The advanced characterisations and analyses, as well as the modelling activities, if needed, should also be performed between partners having the appropriate background and knowledge in the field.
Modelling activities could be performed to support the understanding of the link between performance, durability and microstructures and guide the improvements proposed. Those activities should be based on previously elaborated models by FCH 2 JU supported projects such as Endurance, Sophia, Eco, Pro-SOFC or other similar work.
It is expected that the technology starts at TRL2 and reaches TRL4 at the end of the project.
The consortium should include at least three cell or stack manufacturers involved in SOE, co-SOE or rSOC developments as well as research institutions and academic groups working in these field(s).

Expected Impact:
The project should provide the industry with a choice of materials and the related manufacturing processes to be implemented into the next generation of SOC cells and stacks, in order to improve the performance, durability and cost of cells and stacks and to make them ready to be scaled up to industrial production.

Stability upon SOFC/SOE cycling for rSOC mode: similar as compared to individual SOFC or SOE modes, that is to say degradation rate upon SOFC/SOE cycling of 1%/1,000h or below in each mode;
Stability upon load cycling: similar as compared to steady state operation, that is to say degradation rate upon load cycling of 1%/1,000h or below;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The foreseen magnitude of renewable electricity (RE) production requires the development of large-scale offshore wind and potentially floating solar PV. Significant challenges lie ahead regarding the implementation of such renewable electricity generation, especially because of the required investments in electricity infrastructure to transport peak RE production to shore and the increasing variability due to the substantial temporal mismatch between supply and demand.
The offshore conversion of renewable electricity to renewable hydrogen by electrolysis overcomes several of these challenges, as hydrogen transportation and storage can be done at large scale and relatively low cost. Many offshore oil and gas assets in the North Sea and elsewhere will also soon be out of purpose because EU’s natural gas sources are declining, so re-purposing these for renewable hydrogen production and transport to shore may accelerate and de-risk the implementation of an offshore energy system.
The foremost technical challenge for producing renewable hydrogen offshore is the development of an electrolyser module which is compatible with that environment, while being sufficiently compact to achieve very high rates of hydrogen production per platform or per wind turbine, and able to survive long term when connected directly to an intermittent variable renewable power supply. Different specific conditions, including the marine environment, stringent safety requirements, commercial terms of existing delivery contracts and the difficult accessibility make it very challenging.
Scope:
This topic aims to develop and test an offshore electrolyser module of >1MW at an onshore, seafront location. The electrolyser should form one component of a proposed multi-module design solution for a stand-alone offshore renewable hydrogen production facility, in order to facilitate a subsequent demonstration programme at scale. All factors pertaining to the exacting offshore environment should be considered (including the electrolyser’s requirement to desalinate and purify sea water, operating in a high salinity environment, pressurizing the hydrogen output to enable it’s transfer by pipeline to shore, surviving periods of zero renewable power input, transportation to site, commissioning, ease of operation and maintenance).
Laboratory tests should already verify that the developed electrolyser will still reach the MAWP Addendum 2024 KPIs for hydrogen production [59]. This should be followed by a field test programme of at least 12 months, with operating conditions reflecting the variability and capacity factor of the renewable power input. The test programme should be sufficiently comprehensive and qualified to clarify what performance to expect from offshore renewable hydrogen production (in terms of efficiency, degradation, maintenance cost etc.) and to convince stakeholders that a multi-module facility based on the developed electrolyser module could subsequently be installed offshore. Hydrogen should preferably be injected in a Hydrogen or Natural gas grid.
Permitting and regulatory approval should be sought for the developed electrolyser module and certification obtained before completion of the project. A techno economic assessment of installing and operating offshore electrolyser facilities should be undertaken, with consideration given to transferring hydrogen or hydrogen admixtures to shore, and candidate business cases identified.
The consortium should include the offshore energy sector, an electrolyser manufacturer and a systems engineering company or a qualified competence center with strong links to hydrogen safety expertise. The consortium should possess the necessary contractual and commercial expertise to analyse the market for hydrogen if the considered offshore hydrogen approach is widely applied.

Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell or electrolyser components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The penetration of intermittent renewable electricity based on solar and wind energy increases the need to match supply and demand for power. Electrolysis is a means to convert excess electricity into hydrogen that can be stored and re-electrified at a later time, or used for other energy consuming or industrial processes. As a flexible load the electrolyser can also offer grid balancing services provided that it is of sufficient capacity and responsiveness to participate in the power industry’s balancing markets.
This topic aims to demonstrate services that electrolysis can provide to the grid operator and electrolyser operation in relation to the power market price. Electrolysers need to be developed so that they are suitable for participating in grid balancing markets. For example, innovation is required to develop PEM electrolysers of much greater capacity (by approximately one order of magnitude) than the largest versions in use today. When market prices are low, extra hydrogen can be economically produced. In addition, income can be earned by electrolyser operators for providing grid services, while selling the hydrogen (and potentially oxygen) produced on the market.
The challenges are:
Demonstration of large electrolysis units (>3 MW) using the latest available PEM or pressurized alkaline technology
Providing grid balancing services/power demand management on a commercial basis
Recent years of R&D have significantly improved the production ramp up and down flexibility of electrolysis technology and improved the scalability from kW to MW size. What is still lacking is large scale infield demonstration at sites where both multiple grid services are required and where hydrogen can be distributed and offered for high value markets, such as e.g. industrial gases, transport fuel and power-to-gas. Only such applications can provide both the scale for providing grid balancing and reaching cost levels where additional revenue can be generated from hydrogen distribution and sales.
Scope:
This Innovation Action seeks proposals which demonstrate improved electrolyser technologies beyond actual state-of-the-art receiving revenue by providing grid balancing services and demand management, whilst distributing and receiving revenues from hydrogen (and potentially oxygen) for high value markets.
The objective of the project is to deploy and monitor improved electrolyser systems configured to attract revenues from grid services and leveraging timely power price opportunities, in addition to providing hydrogen (and potentially oxygen) for high value markets.
The scope of the project is:
To develop a large scale electrolyser in excess of 3MW of sufficiently rapid response time (of the order of a few seconds), to participate in the existing primary and secondary grid balancing markets. The installed power and operating regime should be duly justified to identify the advantages offered to the grid within the long term business model. The hydrogen purity should meet the application requirements. The output pressure shall be designed to fulfil, when possible, the required pressure for the hydrogen application targeted - including buffer storage needs if any - and reduce as far as possible the need for dedicated hydrogen compression units downstream. Storage and compression are not in the scope of this topic.
To focus on the inclusion of specific improvements of the current state-of-the-art related to the electrolyser operation under partial loads, quick response, system operation for providing reserve and frequency response services, forecasting models for electricity price and renewable energy production
To demonstrate an energy consumption consistent with 2020 expectations of 52 kWh/kg @1000+/kg for alkaline technology and 48 kWh/kg @1000+/kg for PEM technology at nominal power*.
To demonstrate a CAPEX for the electrolyser consistent with 2020 expectations of 630 €/kW for alkaline technology and 1000 €/kW for PEM technology at nominal power. These target costs do not include the specific tailoring of the electrolysis to be compatible with the grid services to be brought.
To demonstrate the benefits from grid services revenue streams and power price opportunities, as foreseen in the ongoing implementation and revision of the electricity markets. Here, the consortium will demonstrate that they are able to obtain these revenues by entering into commercial contracts with the grid operators or utilities who value these services. The value could be demonstrated also by other means that confirms the revenue potential.
A comprehensive operation plan must be put in place. State of the art electrolysers and downstream systems must be installed and operated for a minimum period of two years
Electrolyser systems will strive to demonstrate a sufficient level of responsiveness to meet the requirements of the grid services and power price opportunities (e.g. for rapid modulation, rapid start, frequency response, as required by the services offered to the grid); this will be done in collaboration with grid operators.
The proposal will indicate the operating scenarios, the duration of production, the quantities of hydrogen produced and the use foreseen. Consortia will preferably build upon outcome from previous projects funded by the FCH-JU and on already feasible business cases, so that potential customers (transport use, industry or utility) do not discontinue the use of the installation after project end, but on the contrary support continued market roll-out efforts. The proposal must include an initial plan for use of the installation after the project.
TRL is expected to go from 6 (technology demonstrated in relevant environment) or 7 (system prototype demonstration in operational environment) to 8 (system complete and qualified).
Eligible consortia will analyse and compare the value chains for the business cases considered, such as for instance electrolyser and hydrogen technology developers, electricity grid operators, gas companies, HRS network operators, industrial hydrogen customers, utilities and energy companies. Specifically, the partnership must include strong links to:
the necessary contractual and commercial expertise to access revenues from the grid services and/or power price opportunities
technical expertise for the design, provision and operation of the electrolyser and associated hydrogen distribution and supply technologies
market access for downstream provision of hydrogen for high value markets such as industrial gas, transport fuel or power-to-gas
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution for this topic is EUR 16 million. This funding is to be allocated to 2 projects:
One project demonstrating PEM technology of at least 6 MW. This must be achieved with either two electrolysers of at least 3 MW or one single electrolyser of at least 6 MW. The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution of this topic is 12 M€.
One project demonstrating pressurized alkaline technology of at least 3 MW. The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution of this topic is 4 M€.
The funding includes the additional activities suggested under the scope of the topic. The capacity of the electrolyser should be linked to the budget via the cost KPIs in the MAWP but also reflect the specific tailoring costs for ensuring electrolysis is compatible with the grid services requirements. The grid connection costs and the electricity costs for the test phase are eligible for the funding. On the contrary, electricity costs during business operation are not eligible.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With the Paris Climate Agreement, the need for short and long term sustainable grid support, has become more urgent than ever. A zero emission alternative for fossil fuel based (backup) power supply is needed. Excess electricity, from wind and solar renewable generation, can be converted into hydrogen and stored for re-electrification during periods of energy shortage.
Grid operators need power supply technologies on MW scale that have fast response times and excellent load-following capabilities. With such a technology they can facilitate efficient and reliable interaction with the grid on both transmission and distribution level, and ensure energy security for end users. Flexible hydrogen fuelled fuel cell power plants (FCPP) could be perfectly suited for this purpose as, compared to other technologies, they have very high efficiency, potential for fast and effective load-following capabilities, zero emission, and can be used for both short and long term grid support (winter months). Together with large (MW scale) rapid response electrolysers, which are developed and demonstrated in previous calls, large hydrogen-fuelled FCPPs have the potential to become one of the key enabling technologies for the future renewable energy based infrastructure of Europe.
1-2 MW size hydrogen FCPP’s have both been built and successfully demonstrated via European programs in recent years. However, these systems, its fuel cells, and other key components were not designed for flexible dynamic power to power operation. Moreover, with the applied fuel cells and system design the required cost levels cannot be reached, even not if the units are built in high volumes. This is because the fuel cells applied were not designed for MW size applications, the system and component development was not well integrated, and a modular approach and capital equipment cost level (Capex) did not have priority. So, significant (design) improvements of the system and the fuel cells are required. Furthermore, we need experience how to connect flexible FCPP to the grid.
Only via a joint step-by-step innovative approach the European technology, the European supply/value chain, and the market can be further developed. Europe is still leading with large-scale hydrogen FCPP technology but the basis of the European supply chain is small. To be competitive with existing technologies (e.g. diesel gen sets), Capex of < 1,500 Euro/kW is required to open this market for large-scale hydrogen FCPP technology.
Scope:
Design of a modular highly flexible MW size fuel cell power plant for dynamic P2P applications of H2 and baseload operation to be connected to the grid.
Next to the complete design of the FCPP, it includes the design and development of key components and validation of their performance and scale up potential, with the purpose to optimise performance and minimise Capex for a MW size system (e.g. 2 MW).
The Capex reduction could for example be accomplished by a reduction in the materials costs, the number of components and connections, the production steps, costs power electronics, and most importantly the development of larger fuel cell stacks.
The chosen concepts should be modular and integrating manufacturability approach, resulting in a design that is fit for mass production.
Validation via a pilot scale flexible FCPP in an industrially relevant environment and compatible with large scale manufacturing. H2 can originate from P2G and/or industry H2 vents.
The selected size of the pilot installation should be logical in view of the modular design of the MW size FCPP and validation purposes (e.g. 75 – 200 KW).
The individual fuel cells stacks should have the same power output during the validation period as envisaged for the MW size FCPP and are fully integrated into the pilot FCPP system.
The project should strive to validate a sufficient level of responsiveness to meet the requirements of the grid services and dynamic electricity price opportunities (e.g. for rapid modulation, rapid start, frequency response, as required by services offered to the grid).
It should include control systems, diagnostics and monitoring, management of unbalanced stack (due to e.g. degradation), management and forecasting for better grid integration and will be connected to the grid.
The duration of the validation in an industrial relevant environment should be at least 8 months.
The proposal must include an initial plan for use of the pilot installation after the project.
In order to optimize the design of system and components the suppliers and system integrators should work closely together and show that they apply a joint, open, integrated and multidisciplinary approach.
Learnings from other (national and international) projects, including the projects in the frame of the LCE topic for smart grid, storage and system integration technologies for distribution system, should be included where possible.
Further develop and reinforce (repeatable) business models, plans, and service strategy.
This topic puts significant focus on the further development of the FC stack and is a prerequisite for the success and competitiveness of the European sector in future.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Hydrogen can play a pivotal role, either being produced by electrolysis as a service to the electricity grid (sector coupling) or produced on purpose for decarbonization of hard-to-electrify sectors (e.g. individual heat, and long-range mobility).
There is presently no harmonized and systematic approach across EU regarding the ability to inject hydrogen into the high-pressure gas network, and various European operators display non-consistent hydrogen admission rates. This un-clarity strongly hinders the ability of projects promoters to de-risk their project using the option to evaluate their excess hydrogen production into the organized Integrated Energy gas Market (IEM), and hinders policy makers when trying to properly assess the potential role of hydrogen for sector coupling and in the energy transition at large.
The topic aims at establishing and documenting that hydrogen injection into the EU wide high-pressure gas infrastructure is a long-term sustainable solution, supporting not only sector coupling between electricity and gas, but also opening the role of hydrogen as a cost-efficient decarbonization mean for gas usages [1]; this is in line with the European Commission proposal to update the EU Gas Directive to improve the functioning of the EU internal gas market, increase competition between suppliers, and boost Europe's energy security.
In existing power-to-gas demonstration projects, hydrogen is injected locally into the low-pressure distribution grid or in very specific higher-pressure locations. This solution, although necessary in the short run and appropriate for projects of a limited injection rate, cannot address a scale up of hydrogen production. In particular, injection of hydrogen in the low-pressure grid as a mix is limited by the limited size of demand in summer and the acceptable methane/hydrogen ratio. This has been already documented as a challenge e.g. for biomethane injection. Conversely, a total conversion of a low-pressure grid to pure hydrogen usage requires a replacement of almost all end-users’ appliances, and is conditioned by the vicinity of specific geological formations (salt caverns) to address the swing in production and demand.
The challenge for this topic is to enable injection of hydrogen into the high-pressure gas transmission network safely at industrial scale, addressing both the issue of scalability (ability to decarbonize the gas usages in all their aspects), and marketability/bankability of projects (accessing the IEM for excess hydrogen). In the absence of an answer to the CH4/H2 admixture possibility, hydrogen use will be restricted to limited niches, leading to a market fragmentation and inefficiency of energy use.
The ability to operate the gas system in a mixed hydrogen/methane environment relies on assessing systematically and in an EU harmonized way the technical adaptions, which have to be made in the operating and maintenance processes, materials, admixture steering etc. across the whole system. In this respect, the technical and legal framework is lacunar, and has to be specified and harmonized across EU. Technical specifications on the network and components of the network should be defined based on facts established through scientific knowledge, lab and larger scale test.
[1]: At EU level, gas usage is presently representing 22% of Final Energy Consumption (20% electricity), and various studies have proven that a 100% electricity FEC solution would be unnecessarily costly
Scope:
The potential project should address the development, and subsequent operation of a research and development platform reproducing all the components of a high-pressure network and allowing testing of various accessories and appliances for various H2/CH4 admixtures:
It should validate levels of admixtures compatible with the technical elements of the existing high-pressure gas grid (approx. 40 to 80 bars), and high-pressure industrial users equipment (not addressed by the topic FCH-04-3-2019: Hydrogen admixtures in natural gas domestic and commercial end uses). In particular it should provide knowledge to support the adaption of maintenance procedure for a safe operation of the high-pressure gas network with regards to different levels of H2/CH4 admixture;
It should validate the industrialization of innovations necessary to make the whole existing gas system (pipeline, fittings, but also industrial end users’ equipment) compatible with these admixtures (e.g. gas quality steering through the mixing equipment, inspection tools etc.).
The project should fill the technical gaps identified by several stakeholders, in particular for high-pressure grid. The scope of the research and development platform should be based on the gap analysis of the main barriers in the state-of-the-art technology and standardisation identified by the Working Group Hydrogen from the Sector Forum Energy Management (SFEM).
It is therefore expected that the project would deliver:
An impact assessment concerning the use of H2 in various percentage mixed with natural gas (up to 100% H2); this should also embrace the associated fittings and other components for all of the technologies within the high-pressure gas networks;
A fact-based assessment of the roles of these technologies in integrating H2 and CH4 energy systems at EU level thanks to economic modelling and identification of legal aspects on inter-operability and cross-border regulatory issues;
Pre-normative research actions leading to standardisation at EU level.
Moreover, it is also expected that the admixture facility would:
Have a capacity of injecting equal or greater than 5 kg/h of hydrogen at full load into the test loop;
Operate with concentrations from 0 to 100% hydrogen with various ramp rates, response times and pressure cycles;
Operate with transient gas characteristics and flow rate (depending on sources - natural gas, new generation biomethane etc.);
Have precise measurement and control of the hydrogen concentration in the injected gas, whereby the solution must be scalable and easily applied at high pressure level and for various concentration limits;
Be able to accommodate various tests or certification programs, including on network equipment, appliances and coatings.
While the test loop should be used to:
Test (high pressure > 40 bar) gas network equipment that could be impacted by the presence of hydrogen, as identified by the consortium, and present necessary changes to equipment and/or maintenance procedures;
Define principles and improve the design of hydrogen injection and mixing system in line with network behaviour. An optimum design should be published to establish a solid basis for hydrogen injection systems across EU;
Test separation systems to meet cases where some users’ process cannot accommodate the presence of hydrogen. Focus should be placed on streams where hydrogen is present in small concentrations (lower than 15%), since for high concentrations present Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology is already optimized.
From the regulatory perspective, it is expected that the potential project would also:
Identify the legal aspects, cross-border regulatory issues and support schemes and European green certificates schemes that hinder or enable the adoption of various H2NG blends across Europe and give recommendations for alterations where needed;
Identify issues related to managing the energy system (both physical and commercial, including use of certificates) across Member States and identify the necessary roles in system management;
Develop and publish a pathway for a stepwise integration of hydrogen in the EU gas network.
Safety of the whole hydrogen chain, from the injection in gas network, to the gas metering, leakage detection, pipeline inspection should be the main technical objective and goal of the platform. For example, technical specifications on the use of components of the network, based on tests performed in the platform will allow the injection of hydrogen in gas network while improving safety. Better knowledge of hydrogen impact on pipeline integrity is needed to know or insure the compatibility of existing gas network with hydrogen transmission and adaptions of gas network control and maintenance procedures.
TRL at start: 4 and TRL at the end of the project: 6.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to support acceleration for the implementation of power-to-gas systems by solving technical barriers and initiating the removal of legal and regulatory barriers to injection of hydrogen in the gas transmission network. This will enable hydrogen produced at sites during periods of excess renewable power to be sold in countries with lower availability of renewable power, even if these places are in a different EU country. As a consequence, it will be supportive of renewable electricity production integration, but also of a deep decarbonisation of the gas usages.
The platform developed by the project will validate the technical, legal, regulatory conditions for safe operation of the gas transmission system, supporting the integration of hydrogen “at scale” in the EU-wide gas system, and therefore in the Integrated Energy Market. Operators’ and market-players’ responsibilities, and mechanisms for dealing and managing the energy system across at least two EU Member States will be identified, and help develop transnational knowledge exchange towards an optimal (stepwise) integration of H2 and CH4.
The project should aim to improve the understanding of the impacts of admixtures on the high pressure transmission grid and related equipment, complementing the knowledge produced by the other two related topics of this call (topic FCH-02-1-2019: Combined electrolyser-HRS and Power-to-Gas system and topic FCH-04-3-2019: Hydrogen admixtures in natural gas domestic and commercial end uses).
It is further expected that the equipment installed during the project will remain available for long-term R&D work into gas grid injection, and made available free to EU stakeholders outside the consortium, as a basis for further development while hydrogen production gets traction across Europe.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The increasing contribution of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the electricity grid is creating a substantial temporal mismatch between supply and demand. To balance this daily to seasonal mismatch it is necessary to have a large facility for storing and withdrawing VRE. Underground storage of gas molecules is cost efficient, environmentally friendly, and suitable for storing large amounts (e.g. more than 200 GWh per salt cavern or over 1,000 GWh in a gas field). The combination of VRE, electrolysers and geological storage can therefore provide a means for capturing and holding renewable energy at an unprecedented scale for satisfying time-varying energy demands. When moving towards a fully renewable system, very large volumes of hydrogen storage will be needed and the rates of energy transfer in/out the store will vary substantially across the day/year, with associated variations in pressure level. It is therefore important to understand whether EU can find a suitable storage option using its depleted gas or oil fields and other geological stores in a time-varying cyclic manner to buffer the future energy system with renewable energy.
Although pure hydrogen storage in salt caverns is practiced in some locations, hydrogen storage in depleted gas or oil fields has not been done anywhere in the world – only few attempts to inject hydrogen up to a certain percentage. Lab and field trials have shown that hydrogen can yield geochemical and microbiological reactions in the subsurface. Also, hydrogen has different mobility, dissolution and diffusion characteristics, when compared with natural gas. Some preliminary studies are indeed promising regarding the possibility of using the depleted fields for hydrogen storage, but further research and experimentation is required.
Scope:
The main objectives of this topic are to research the feasibility of implementing large-scale storage of renewable hydrogen in depleted gas fields and other types of geological store, and to undertake a techno-economic assessment of how the underground storage of renewable hydrogen could facilitate achieving a zero-emissions energy system in EU by 2050.
Suitable geological stores should be identified and classified, together with information concerning nearby connecting infrastructure and wind/solar farms. The outstanding feasibility questions should be defined, and a research plan of laboratory and possibly field tests and literature surveys implemented to cover all questions concerning geological, microbiological, engineering and economic factors. The analysis should help clarify whether most of the hydrogen can be recovered, or if a significant percentage would be lost due to dissolution, diffusion, viscous fingering, chemical reactions or leakage.
Cyclability and longevity aspects of such stores should also be addressed. The geographical distribution across EU of all suitable types of geological store and their potential hydrogen capacities should be also identified.
A comprehensive techno-economic analysis of the considered approach should be undertaken, building on the findings of the HyUnder project [57], to examine the potential for its widespread implementation across the period 2025-2050. This should include (onshore and offshore) mapping of the proximity of suitable underground stores with existing and future wind/solar farms, modelling the production of renewable hydrogen, associated gas compression and hydrogen pipeline networks to transfer hydrogen to/from the stores, and identifying the profiles and amounts of renewable energy that can be buffered by such storage facilities to meet time-varying energy demands across all end use sectors. The developed model should identify how to match renewable supply with energy demand at all times by appropriately sizing and operating the technologies involved in producing, storing, distributing and using renewable hydrogen. Future scenarios should be formulated or existing scenarios/roadmaps should be reviewed for the EU to establish the considered approach at a prodigious scale by 2050.
In addition, the techno-economic feasibility of implementing hydrogen storage in preferred locations should be assessed to a level sufficient to support a decision whether or not to proceed to field pilot demonstration. This will provide substantial insights into the suitability for implementing such storage across EU and enable the development of positive business cases for adoption.
The project consortium should involve geologists to undertake expert analyses of underground storage opportunities for a wide range of sites across EU, both offshore and onshore.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Interconnects are crucial components in the upscaling of successful cell concepts to stack performance and reliability. Compared to PEM technology, this pathway is more critical for SOFCs and SOECs (SOCs, including reversible SOC), where cell-interconnect contacting is an enduring challenge. Interconnects are located between individual cells, thus being exposed to both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres at the SOC’s elevated temperatures. This leads to highly stressful conditions for the interconnects, causing significantly higher ASR values per cell in stack configuration than for a single repeating unit for SOC.
Furthermore, due to poor stability over long operating periods of the contact area of coated interconnects, Ohmic resistance increases with time – mainly on the oxygen side – affecting the electric performance of the stack. Thus, SOC interconnects are called for with robust, conductive coating, able to withstand extensive thermal cycling, with fully compatible thermal expansion coefficient, and with improved architecture and/or surface material to guarantee better as well as more durable contacting between cells and interconnect. While ceramic interconnects deliver desirable electronic and mechanical properties, the low ductility of the material challenges their contacting capabilities. Adding to the low design flexibility of ceramics, the low porosity leads to high-pressure drops, lowering the overall efficiency.
Scope:
Besides maintaining excellent, long-term electrical contact through high specific-surface current collection area, it is crucial to maintain low-pressure drop in the channel distribution of the interconnect, while providing fine flow field patterns for optimal contact resistance and high-power output. Fabrication costs should be kept low and the manufacturing investment cost-effective. Uniform and impermeable gas-tight coating should be achieved to protect against chromium evaporation with high electrical conductivity material. It is recommended that outcomes of FCH 2 JU projects Scored 2.0 and Evolve are taken into account.
The interconnect solution developed in this project should include the bi-polar plate itself together with the protective coating and the contacting materials to make the junction between cells. The development should make use of novel 3D contact Materials and manufacturing solutions that are flexible in use and could be adapted to any manufacturer’s planar stack design, as well as being adaptable to mass-manufacturing processes. Designs that reduce to a minimum the required manufacturing steps is desirable in this respect: this should be proven with a representative stack production batch. The solution proposed should be operational in a temperature range of 600-750°C or 750-900°C, as these two temperature ranges will most likely lead to different material requirements. For electrolysis operation, the fuel side will pose harsher demands on the interconnect than in fuel cell mode (e.g. chromium evaporation), which should be accounted for.
The solution should provide excellent capacity for absorbing applied pressure between current collectors and interconnect, as well as compensating planarity tolerances of adjacent components, allowing 30-50-micron tolerances. It should thus ensure uniform mechanical pressure on the whole cell and maintain lightness of stack. Chemical and thermomechanical compatibility with neighbouring component materials, including sealing when relevant, and electrode materials, should be guaranteed for the targeted operating conditions. The developed interconnect should maximize gas permeability to guarantee low-pressure drops. Improved, uniform conducting throughout the operation ranges prevents hotspot formation and lifetime benefits are to be expected.
Regarding interconnect materials, critical rare-earth elements should be avoided as much as possible, in view of a strategic supply chain for Europe, and long-term stability should be guaranteed, avoiding material inter-diffusion between contacting components.
The final interconnect design(s) should be demonstrated for more than 3000 hours and 50 cycles in a 1 kW stack.
TRL at start: 3 and TRL at end: 5.
MRL at start: 4-5 and MRL at end: 7-8.
The full value chain of the proposed novel interconnect (from raw materials supply to fabrication and assembly methods, compatibility with SOC technology type and material recovery) should lead to a strategic position of established European manufacturers in the international SOC supply chain and leverage job creation opportunities in the EU. It is expected that the proposal involves a component manufacturer based in EU or H2020 Associated Countries, who should be willing to expand or significantly enlarge its current product portfolio with low-cost interconnects. Similarly, it is expected to involve at least one stack manufacturer to adopt the novel interconnect architecture and show marginal dependence of interconnection fabrication costs on SOC stack design.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
Improved contacting, flow distribution and interface stability will lead to radically better performing interconnects, and thus SOC stack performance and durability. This should lead to a demonstrated increase in stack lifetime in representative operating conditions, allowing service that is more reliable to the end user.
Furthermore, it is expected that – by virtue of the materials chosen and their assembly – the interconnect materials system and shaping process proposed shall be global and the solution should be adaptable at low cost into any SOC manufacturer’s specific stack design, benefiting the lifetime and stackability of individual cells.
Finally, the impacts on the overall supply chain should boost European competitiveness by generating a strategic position in terms of the capability of shaping specialty materials for advanced applications, leveraging capital and excellence in European manufacturing industry, and should build on research organisations’ existing competences and ultimately stimulate competition on the International market.
Technical targets, considering both fuel cell and electrolysis operation modes:
ASR of the interconnect as a component: <25 mOhm.cm²
Gas pressure drop: below 30 mbar/plate across the interconnect in stack configuration
ASR-Degradation: <5 mOhm cm² or <0.2 % (whichever the higher value) per 1000 hours or 10 cycles in a system relevant environment
Extrapolated Costs: <5€ per unit for interconnect materials + <5€ per unit for coating and processing at a production volume of 50 MW per year.

Most fuel cell systems, key components like stacks, and BOP components like inverters, heat exchangers, etc., are produced in small quantities with considerable manual input. In order for mass deployment, stationary fuel cells must now achieve significant cost reductions underpinned by robust/high yield manufacturing processes at the cell, stack and system level. To reduce costs and increase quality, cost effective manufacturing technologies are required, and there is a high demand within the European stationary fuel cell sector for this type of activity to secure EU fuel cell competitiveness. This topic focuses on fundamental actions to improve production processes and scaled production for stacks, stack components, key components like BOP components, system integration, and whole systems. The aim is to develop/apply novel manufacturing technologies for industry, including for example: laser welding, coating, 3D printing, molding and casting of materials for fuel cell system components and/or stacks.
Scope:
Proposals should support development and use best in class manufacturing technologies, production processes, equipment and tooling with cost impact on, for example, stacks or key BOP components for the industrial segment. Optimised mass manufacturing processes can include automated assembly, shortened cycle times, continuous production and lean manufacturing, compatible with environmental and health standards. Thus development of production processes with fewer steps, tolerant to varying quality of raw materials, and with lower-cost materials or materials with reduced environmental or health impacts are important, as well as advanced quality control methods. Innovative technologies could also be considered to provide complex design solutions with increased performance while allowing for lower costs compared to conventional production technologies. Pilot plants are excluded.
To achieve cost reduction the project may also aim at developing industry-wide agreements for standard BoP components for FCs, including heat exchangers, reformers, converters, inverters, post-combustors, actuators and sensors. To reach this target it is necessary to establish a resilient supply chain with respect of REACH Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006, OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p.1 and other regulations impacting on manufacturing.

Projects should demonstrate how players in the fuel cell industry will enable the step-up from high cost small scale production towards lower cost higher volumes.

The amount of hydrogen that can be transported by a compressed gas distribution trailer is limited to 300 kg (at 200 bar). The pressure in hydrogen delivery trucks is expected to rise from 250 to around 550 bar increasing payload up to 600 kg. Using liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LHOC)[1] this amount can be more than doubled, while using lower cost distribution trailers at the same time. Similarly, the storage of these hydrogen carriers is more cost effective than the storage of hydrogen itself. Additional advantages are the lower flammability and lower explosive nature of LOHC’s compared with compressed hydrogen storage. Some LOHC’s show even no explosive nature, reducing the storage costs considerably.
However, the use of these carriers requires a hydrogenation step at the hydrogen production facility and a dehydrogenation step at the point, or time, of use. Recent advances in hydrogen carriers have led to end-to-end system cost that could be comparable or better than gaseous hydrogen storage and distribution.
This topic calls for the demonstration of such a carrier for large scale hydrogen storage and/or hydrogen distribution

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Renewable energy sources are significantly reshaping the energy production scheme in Europe. Today’s still dominating fossil fuels will be significantly reduced in their role as electricity source. Despite this, carbon containing renewable primary energy in form of industrial and municipal waste, secondary and tertiary biomass, or even waste discharge recovery sites will remain available in significant amounts. Those waste streams can be converted through various processes into syngas containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in varying quantities. The flexibility of Solid Oxide membrane reactors to operate both in electrolyser and fuel cell mode offers the possibility to exploit those streams both to convert electricity into gas and to convert the streams directly into electricity. Balancing power plants can and play an important role for both power generation in low production periods and grid stabilisation and energy storage through their power-to-gas capability. They also offer a potential low-cost source for renewable CO2.
The challenge addresses the elaboration of concepts (process flow diagrams) for power balancing plant based on the thermal integration of various gasification processes and Solid Oxide membrane reactors. Both the waste-to-syngas process and the solid oxide membrane reactor operate at elevated temperatures and offer thereby possibilities of synergies for H2 or CO2 out-coupling, use of O2 enriched air for gasification and thermal coupling are available. The aim is to provide high energy system benefits in the evolving energy landscape, making use of the carbon containing waste streams for the simultaneous application of power generation and energy storage in a single balancing plant. The plants both contribute to the elimination/transformation of municipal waste, industrial waste, waste disposal site recovery and the balancing of the electricity grid. This kind of plants are closing one gap in the circular economy.
Scope:
Based on existing future energy and sustainability scenarios, the project should identify:
What low-grade waste streams will likely remain available in the long term and
What processes could be suitable to transform them inside Solid Oxide Cell membrane reactors into fuel for power generation or feedstock for power-based chemicals and fuels.
To reach economic viability, such plants need to integrate the usually energy consuming waste preparation steps tightly into the different operating modes. Flow sheeting including pinch analysis provide a base for selection of optimised solutions in terms of electrical efficiency and/or flexibility in use for the provision of grid services. The analysis performed should clearly identify the requirements of the integration into a RES dominated power generation landscape. Economic viable paths to reach power scales both meaningful for the waste conversion and power balancing are to be elaborated. Analysis should be performed on what size of balancing plant is suitable both based on available waste stream and the propriety of a RES electricity supply. From there, the economic requirements in terms of investment costs for such a plant have to be estimated to define the conditions for business cases. A pathway for a gradual integration of such plants based on today’s State of the Art is to be elaborated. The small size of the current stacks and systems likely requires a modular up-scale approach. Supply chain constraints of the first commercial products are important boundaries. Experiences and learning curves from other modular industries e.g. the semi-conductor industry can be used as reference cases to understand under what conditions such a new industry could emerge.

The project should:
Identify the long-term available low-grade waste streams;
Elaborate RES Integrated large Power Balancing Plant Designs/flowsheets with Solid Oxide technologies at the core for the scales of 1, 10, 100 MW and 1 GW. The conversion plants integrate directly waste preparation process on both thermal and electrical level;
Suggest development paths and strategies for Solid Oxide Cell power plants from current small-scale technologies and products;
Identify technical bottlenecks at any level (materials, components, systems, externals such as CCU limitation) that need to be resolved for realising such plants and suggest possible measures;
Elaborate under what conditions centralised large scale power conversion plants can be technically and economically realised within the next 10 years;
The technical readiness level will remain on the same level during the project (TRL 2), as conceptual engineering work is in focus rather than experimental work. However, the work goes clearly beyond a conventional study as new concepts are to be elaborated on the technical level, making use of thermodynamic simulation tools and methods such as pinch analysis.

Expected Impact:
The project will provide paths for the techno-economic viability for the deployment of centralized large-scale Solid Oxide plants to buffer the power needs emerging from intermittent and fluctuating RES and offer power storage options in renewable carbon- based chemicals and fuels.
Power conversion plant designs integrating required waste preparation steps (various gasification processes, alternative purification processes) will prepared.
System management and operating strategies integrating partial/peak loading fluctuations amplitudes and frequencies will be recommended.

The outcome of successful project should lay ground towards technological development to address a large market for Solid Oxide reactors in conjunction with RES and the possibilities of providing power storage in synthetic fuels and providing renewable CO2 for further use. The technical concepts elaborated should provide pathways for a faster transition towards a RES dominated energy system at lower overall costs.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
PEM and SOFC systems for stationary applications have reached a maturity level that guarantees their field operation for micro-Combined Heat and Power (μ-CHP) and energy generation (e.g. remote/isolated areas, backup). However, a step forward is needed to improve their availability, reliability and durability together with a reduction in operational cost.
Some EU/FCH 2 JU funded projects have already successfully carried out research and innovation activities focusing on monitoring and diagnostics of PEMFCs (e.g., D-CODE, SAPPHIRE, HEALTH-CODE, GIANTLEAP) and SOFCs (e.g., GENIUS, DESIGN, DIAMOND, INSIGHT) with a preliminary attention to stack lifetime and prognostics, paving the way towards advanced control. Each of these projects proposed monitoring and diagnostic solutions for either balance-of-plant (BOP) or stack. Conventional techniques have been implemented for BOP components of SOFC that may be easily extended to PEM systems. On the other hand, several approaches have been effectively tested for field monitoring and diagnostics of both PEM and SOFC stacks, they range from simple methodologies up to advanced ones, such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Pseudo-Random Binary Signals (PRBS).
A wide expertise has been built and is available among a large research and industrial community, with a well-recognized EU leadership in the field. Nevertheless, a comprehensive tool that could embed all these functions, as derived from the research carried on PEM and SOFC stacks and systems, is not available yet.
Today the state-of-the-health (SOH) of both stack and system can be effectively monitored, whereas prognostic and control actions are not yet considered in a holistic and integrated manner. Indeed, the combination of expected lifetime (RUL) information and adaptive control would help to maintain performance, keep durability and availability in the planned maintenance timeframe or even support its intelligent scheduling (i.e. predictive maintenance). Moreover, a generalized approach applicable equally to both technologies is still missing along with a dedicated experimental campaign, able to prove its validity and reliability during systems long and real operation.
The challenge of this topic is the integration of available monitoring and diagnostic techniques along with the development of both prognostic algorithms and advanced control techniques to be all implemented for enhancement of durability and reliability of stationary PEM and SOFC systems.
Scope:
The project should develop and demonstrate a new generation of robust, general and cost-effective prognostic and control tool for both PEMFC and SOFC systems primarily for μ-CHP and energy generation (e.g. remote/isolated areas, backup). The integration of advanced monitoring and diagnostic algorithms for BOP and stack should be considered as the starting point for the assessment of the state-of-the-health of the whole FC system. The challenge of developing and integrating advanced prognostic and control algorithms ensuring high accuracy, reliability and generalizability for both technologies should be clearly addressed.
The project should address the following actions:
Develop an advanced monitoring, diagnostic, prognostic and control (MDPC) tool, which should embed all the functionalities required for proper integration with both stack and BOP components;
Guarantee high flexibility and generalizability to apply the tool on both PEMFC and SOFC, with limited effort in terms of time and costs;
Apply optimal sensor placement techniques to solve the trade-off between costs (i.e., number of sensors) and effective on-line monitoring, thus maximizing the information level on running systems (stack and BOP);
Implement approaches that suitably combine conventional measurements with more advanced techniques (e.g. EIS, THD, PRBS) able to improve performance and durability by detecting BOP malfunctions and stack faults and applying suitable control counteraction;
Developed monitoring and control tools with functions that could be used for future integration of FC systems with smart grids and application for remote management in the frame of VPP;
Test PEMFC and SOFC systems with embedded prototypes of MDPC tool for field operation, aiming at validation by means of dedicated experimental campaigns in operational environment.
The project should implement hardware solutions already available along with conventional sensors and actuators; therefore, the research of new hardware for monitoring, diagnostic, prognostic and control is not in scope of this topic. The implementation of the MDPC tool should be independent from SOFC or PEMFC system configuration, with little effort for adaptation.
The project should start with TRL 4 and conclude at TRL 7 for prognostic and control algorithms. Although, some components, solutions and algorithms have already achieved TRL above 5 or 6, their integration should lead to an overall TRL of 7 as first step towards certification and industrialization for commercialization.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 3 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration of the project is 4 years with at least 1 year of experimental campaign in operational environment, to test the MDPC tool on both technologies. Testing should be conducted for at least two PEM and two SOFC systems. The cost of the systems for the testing are not in scope of the topic.
Expected Impact:
A proper integration of MDPC functions within PEM and SOFC products will improve performance reproducibility and reliability, and overall leading to more profitable fuel cell systems by reducing the TCO and accelerating its market penetration.
It is expected that such a tool, once implemented in the embedded control of the units, could improve the field performance in terms of extending useful lifetime in real environment by at least 25%, keeping an average efficiency of 35% until the end of life.
Similar to lifetime, two further positive impacts are expected in terms of increased of power availability (≥98%) and reliability (MTBF < 45,000 h) of both stack and BOP components to target 15 years of operation.
The MDPC functionality should not increase the overall system manufacturing cost by more than 3%.
The tool will allow to implement centralized monitoring and predictive maintenance strategies to optimize service costs and support continuous reduction of service costs. The tool shall contribute to the performance improvement of the next generation of stationary FC with enhanced functions, which could be easily integrated with smart grids.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Biomass can be easily converted to fuel gases rich in CH4, CO, and H2, depending on the biomass treatment in anaerobic digestion, thermochemical conversion, or fermentation. The direct use of biomass-derived fuel in high-temperature fuel cells for combined heat and power (CHP) promises significantly higher electrical efficiencies of 55 to 60% and ultra-clean exhausts. Unlike for gas grid injection, the CO2 content in biogas does not have to be removed from the fuel stream, but can on the contrary be used as reforming agent (dry reforming) and increase the electrical efficiency. This greatly simplifies the system layout and avoids the supply of steam for reforming. In addition, separation of leftover bio-CO2 after the CHP generation process will be straightforward and can bring significant benefit to the use of High Temperature Fuel Cells (HTFC) CHP systems in future CO2 valorisation scenarios. For all of these reasons HTFC systems have the potential to achieve technical, environmental and economic advantages relative to currently available biogas conversion technologies.
The use of HTFC is currently being demonstrated in ongoing projects. In particular, the FCH 2 JU funded project DEMOSOFC is demonstrating the use of biogas from a wastewater treatment plant for heat and power production using a HTFC. In this project, the HTFC requires to first clean-up and purify the biogas to grid quality prior to conversion into power and heat. This represents a significant added cost to the overall system, hindering cost-effective exploitation of the technical and environmental advantages of the use of raw biogas in HTFC.
Biogas is primarily methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Depending on its origin, it usually contains small amounts of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), moisture and siloxanes, or also significant amounts of nitrogen in the case of landfill gas. The removal of pollutant and CO2 for the purpose of grid injection is increasingly applied for wastewater treatment plants, which often are located close to the gas grid and present significant volumes of gas. However, biogas from distributed sources such as agricultural waste and manure, or dilute gases like from landfill, are rarely injected. Farms are usually not connected to the gas grid, and in the case of landfill gases, it is rarely economic to concentrate the methane to grid quality. In the latter case, it is even common practice to add methane to the biogas to flare(burn) the gas in order to prevent the methane to vent directly to the atmosphere. This transforms a primary fuel in an energy consumer.
HTFC are in principle able to able to exploit the contained CO2 to increase the conversion efficiency by using the CO2 as reforming agent. The so-called dry-reforming process is replacing then either steam-methane reforming or the catalytic partial oxidation commonly used in fuel cell systems. HTFC as electrochemical energy conversion devices have a high resilience to inert gases such as nitrogen compared to combustion engines. The fuel cell exploits directly the chemical energy contained in the fuel without a combustion process. Independent from above elements, the pollutants such as sulphur components, halogens and siloxanes still need to be removed.
The challenges addressed is to perform the pollutant removal for the HTFC in a simple, low-cost, modular manner, capable to operate on multiple feedstock sources of biogas (organic fraction of urban waste, agricultural/farming residues, landfill, etc.). The removal needs to be able to cope with seasonal or geographical variations, and to reduce significantly complexity and costs related to biogas pre-processing. On the level of system integration, the appropriate conditions for the use of dry-reforming instead of steam reforming with a minimal changes with respect to standard HTFC systems is a further challenge, as only limited customisation can be economically justified. Furthermore, HTFC system operation strategies need to be elaborated to allow system operation with dilute fuels, again with ideally no hardware changes with respect to standard HTFC systems.
Scope:
The scope of the project is to design and engineer an integrated biogas-fed fuel cell system architecture with minimal gas pre-processing. The aspects of low-cost pollutant removal and thermal integration of the system to increase the system efficiency by using the inherent CO2 of the biogas should be the focus of the project. Operation strategies allowing the system to use dilute gases should also be studied.
Proposals submitted under this topic should focus on the conceptual and detailed design of a HTFC-CHP system optimised for raw biomass-derived gaseous fuel operation in a real environment, processing different types of biogas feedstock, coping with gas composition fluctuations and pollutants. More than one type of biogas should be considered, especially considering applications where conversion to bio methane and injection into the natural gas grid is not feasible. In the design, gas fuel pre-processing should be kept to the absolute minimum, integrating potentially processing catalysts for pollutant removal and fuel pre-reforming. The interface between the raw (2nd generation) biomass processing reactor and the fuel cell hot module should be a unique, one-stop appliance that is able to process the full range of bio fuel-gas compositions expected from a given bio-waste valorisation chain. The output gas has to match the requirements of the fuel cell module optimized for bio fuel-gas conversion.
To this effect, targeted tests on clean up, reforming and HTFC materials and components (catalysts, supports, adsorbents, membranes, cells/stacks), where not available from the state-of-the-art, are within the scope of the project. They aim to provide pollutant tolerance level of the critical components of a HTFC system and will provide the base for the final design specifications of the gas cleaning unit. The impact of dry reforming on anode electrodes, to avoid auxiliary steam supply in the system should be evaluated at laboratory scale and reported according to procedures developed in relevant FCH 2 JU projects.
The one-stop bio fuel-gas processing stage should take into account outcomes of previous projects investigating this coupling, such as DEMOSOFC. Where applicable, thermal integration between the FC module and the bio fuel-gas generation should be considered in the system architecture to maximize process efficiency.
Developments that directly modify and adapt the stack and/or reformer to increase their pollutant tolerance levels should only be planned where reduced total cost of ownership for the generated electricity can be expected. This is always to be analysed in comparison with the current base method of purification for pollutant removal.
The design of full-scale FC-CHP units for installation at biogas production sites should be addressed in the project. This should include pathways for the use of bio-CO2 produced. The selection of the size of full-scale should be based on existing market analysis with clear indications of the technical and economic advantages in comparison to both other power conversion technologies (e.g. combustion engines) and gas grid injection.
TRL at start: 3 and TRL at end: 5-6.
At least 2 HTFC manufacturers should participate to open an opportunity to exploit the built-up competences in biogas pre-treatment independently from the FC system manufacturer, offering a business opportunity for specialised actors.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 2 years
Expected Impact:
The use of HTFC-CHP systems is well aligned with European energy and waste related policies. The EC communication on “The role of waste energy in the circular economy” [21] prioritises the use of advanced conversion technologies to obtain bio-derived gas especially for the treatment of biodegradable waste. The expected impact of biomass driven HTFC is therefore very high being a very significant entry market for the deployment of renewable sources-driven HTFC in the medium industrial scale. Based on the modularity of fuel cells, they will likely address initially smaller, distributed power ranges, before addressing at a later stage the large quantities of low quality gases of landfill and retired coal fields.
To profit from this opportunity, the specific impacts the proposed design should achieve are then:
Increased conversion efficiency of waste-derived fuel to electricity and heat, with electrical efficiency above 53% for ordinary biogas;
Energetic exploitation and reduced methane consumption for strongly dilute biogas sources, providing a net electricity output;
a modular biogas processing design that can be easily retrofitted to existing biogas sources;
an opportunity for European gas component manufacturers to provide flexible gas cleaning modules to several FC system manufacturers, in Europe and world-wide;
a gas cleaning system eliminating external auxiliary reactant supplies and coping with a variety of biomass-derived fuel-gases, ideally operable in flexible fuel mode;
standardization of the clean-up section to address different types of biomass-derived fuel gases, leading to compositions acceptable for long-term operation of the optimized fuel cell hot module;
validation of dry reforming capability in the fuel cell to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the integrated system;
projected cost target of < 3.500 €/kWel fuel cell and gas cleaning system at a production volume of 25 MW p.a.;
demonstration of environmental benefits using an LCA;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Mini combined heat and power fuel cell systems (mini-CHP) are energy conversion devices in the range of 5-10 kWe and constitute a promising technology to satisfy local demands for heat and electricity. Their permanent availability can play a key role for the development of smart grid power systems, providing efficient power quickly and efficiently on demand. A significant market lies in intermediate to large scale residential or commercial scale applications, not only for primary power but also for heating. Such system must be able to offer an addition to intermittent RES power production with high electrical efficiency, fast start up and fast dynamic response to provide power even under extreme environmental temperatures. Requirements that other fuel cell technologies, such as SOFCs struggle to meet.
Prior projects on HTPEMFCs focused on the increase of electrical efficiency and performance on the stack level. This topic requests to tackle the performance and efficiency of the CHP system and focuses on both the electrical and thermal efficiency of the system as well as on fast start up and dynamic response. A significant effort must be devoted to integrate thermally the fuel cell with the fuel processor in order to recover the maximum amount of the fuel cell’s wasted heat thus, aiming to system’s level electrical efficiencies up to 55% (LHV). Furthermore, the design and construction of compact systems with high volumetric power density needs to be achieved to fit in residential and commercial environments with space constraints.
Scope:
The overall objective of this topic is to develop, manufacture and validate in a relevant environment mini-CHP energy conversion device using HTPEMFCs technology at 5 kWe. The development activities should build on existing material and stack knowledge and validated designs of HT-PEMFC systems. The improvements targeted on the system design levels should enhance the system’s electrical efficiency, shorten start up time and improve the dynamic response, the volume power density, and simplify the Balance of Plant, as well to increase the durability of a mini-CHP system. Activities on materials and stack design should be limited to adaptation required for proper system integration or improving the thermal management, influencing also on lifetime and efficiency. Reliable data of the operation and stability will be generated in relevant environment. If possible, it is encouraged to reach TRL6 by the end of the project.
The project should aim at both high electrical efficiency and performance as well as high volumetric power density of the mini-CHP system. The topic should therefore aim at the following:
Validation of system’s 50-55% (LHV) DC electrical efficiency depending on fuel (NG, LPG or MeOH) and more than 90% overall efficiency and volumetric power density 10-20 W/l. To achieve these the following should at least be considered:
Improvements or design innovations of the fuel processor and/or the HTPEM stack so that their effective thermal coupling into the system’s BoP will reach DC electrical efficiencies on system level up to 55% (LHV);
Improved BoP design through new concepts for the efficient use of the high temperature heat produced with focus on heating, cooling or additional electricity production;
The mini CHP unit should be compact with high volumetric power density, according to the KPIs mentioned below. The robustness of the system should be proven with accelerated stress test, including fast start/stop cycles (15min), endurance in thermal cycling and fast dynamic response (<10 s) upon change of power. The accelerated test will be carried out for a period of 6 months and for at least 2,000 h of operation.
The projects should increase the state of the technology from TRL3 to TRL5.
The consortium should include at least two industrial partners comprising fuel cell system-core component suppliers (MEA, stack or reformer) and a system integrator with clear perspectives and commitment to exploit the results commercially as access to mini-CHP market is a key element.
Activities should build on past experience and achievements, for example, from earlier FCH 2 JU funded projects (e.g. DeMStack, IRMFC, CISTEM, etc.)

The European energy market has to face the growth of power demand in the industrialized countries.
There are special challenges in each market applications for the commercial sector in the range of 20-100 kW where fuel cell systems can play a key role:
Alternative power supply for these applications is mostly diesel powered and produces CO2, noise and other emissions;
Distributed electricity systems need more flexibility for safe operation;
Need for high energy efficiency and power security and possible integration of renewable energy.
The Roland Berger study “Advancing Europe’s energy systems: Stationary fuel cells in distributed generations” (2015) also mentions “Whilst European power grids are still amongst the most reliable in the world, critical infrastructure providers and businesses with sensitive applications are becoming increasingly interested in decoupling the availability of electricity from the grid and becoming more independent.”
Indeed, the investment costs, availability and lifetime of the system should be comparable to conventional alternatives.
The key markets for 20-100 kW FC technology in the commercial sector are base load operations, also in CHP configuration, for small data centres, commercial and public buildings, telecommunication switching centres, signalling technique for trains and motorways, small industries, security networks and public infrastructure that need to improve power security and energy efficiency. Additionally, in the waste hydrogen segment FCs can play a key role of improving energy efficiency and additional usage of hydrogen that otherwise would not have been used.
So far, no European or national projects funded demonstration of FC systems in such power range and in such market applications.
Scope:
It is the main scope of the project to demonstrate that the FCH technology in the power range of 20-100 kW is ready to contribute to European energy challenges as energy efficiency and power security combined with significant reduction of emissions. Several European industries are active in this power range and are ready to initiate the drive to achieving economies of scale and hence significantly reduce costs enabling further roll-outs/deployment.
In such context of distributed power generation, the main objectives of the topic are to strengthen the performance and reliability of fuel cell systems in various sites in Europe. Such decentralized base load power generation with FCH technology will be implemented while respecting the European industrial requirements of related applications in commercial sector: CHP in apartment building, small industry, critical loads in small industry, security networks etc., also addressing public sector with highly controlled and conservative procurement processes.
This project includes fuel cell systems from minimum 3 different fuel cell system manufacturers in the power range of 20-100kW in order to demonstrate in minimum three countries the different technological products and compare maturity. The installed capacity will be at least 400kW in order to proof concept of scale with regards to allowing progress on standardisation, cost reduction and will address different requirements and applications to compare solutions coming from different European industries. The project will demonstrate at minimum 20 sites with one unit per site in order to demonstrate each of the manufacturers’ technology in a replicable scale. Different power level units in the range of 20-100 kW will be demonstrated in the project. This will also help to increase the public awareness of fuel cell systems as a valuable alternative compared to conventional systems across Europe.
Further objectives:
Demonstration, evaluation and optimization of new solutions and components especially at the FC stack level and/or on systems levels through field tests with improved product concepts e.g. pre-serial status as compared to previous field trials, by validating next generations of product designs.
Demonstration through field applications of the advantages of innovative technologies (hardware or software) including, but not limited to, monitoring, control, diagnosis, lifetime estimation, new BoP components.
Online monitoring of operating conditions, load demands and system output will provide initial data to determine the overall efficiency of the system within the project period.
Establishment of a demonstration/commercialization pathway for European SMEs innovating in the development, manufacture and supply chain of fuel cell products by involvement of customers including distributors and end users.
Field demonstration usage data, efficiency, reliability are to be reported. Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html.
The project can address one or several application segments. The project will be open to all fuel cell technologies. The project is also open for different fuel sources for the fuel cells, but hydrogen from renewable sources should be considered where possible. Electrolyser costs are not included.
TRL at start: 6
TRL at end: 7-8
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping.
The consortium should include at least three fuel cell manufacturers providing minimum two and maximum ten units per manufacturer and additionally relevant customers from the industrial and or commercial sector. Research institutions and academic groups could be also included. The total installed power should be at least 400kW.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 7.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-5 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
The suggested topic embodies the opportunity to connect substantial research (scaling models, prediction of energy needs combined with fuel-cell performance) with innovative industrial practices (system development and engineering against actual configurations). Moreover, it has high social impact, thus opening the fuel-cell research and innovation world to sectors industry or disaster recovery.
Moreover, significant attention should be paid to improvements in the technical and economic performance of the FC products including stacks, BoP components and their manufacturing.
Reduction of CAPEX at a level of less than 6,000€/kW
Increase of system lifetime of more than 15 years and increase of maintenance interval
Improve of electrical efficiency of all possible applications in this topic in the range of 42-55% or CHP efficiency of more than 90%.
This demonstration must not only raise public awareness; it should be used to establish confidence in technology, business models and market readiness with end-users and authorities."

While fuel cell systems have generally reduced their cost in recent years by building pilot manufacturing lines and benefiting from some early volume take-up on the Balance of Plant side; the cells, stacks and stack components are still the major limiting factors on the cost reduction curve. In the industry, several manufacturing processes for stacks and their key components have emerged as state-of-the-art, since their original development from the 1990s until today. More recent new and innovative processes, implemented in other sectors, have not yet been considered for fuel cell stacks and components, as the emphasis has been on making fuel cells perform as effectively as possible. Past FCH JU calls (2014-2015) have focused on BoP manufacturing and the improvement of existing manufacturing methods to increase yield and repeatability and reduce costs. However, in a young industry such as fuel cells, more innovative manufacturing processes, production techniques and approaches offer significant prospects for the greater cost reductions and quality improvements that are required as the industry moves toward mass production to follow the increased demand from growing fuel cell markets.
The most prominent step change featured in this call is to seek cross-fertilisation between fuel cell and other manufacturing sectors so that the use of less typical but potentially disruptive manufacturing techniques can bring the cell, stack components and stack cost, quality and performance a significant step beyond that achievable by today’s more “conventional” manufacturing process technologies. Among others, techniques such as extrusion, co-sintering, vacuum deposition and coating technologies, 3D (additive layer) and inkjet printing, as well as other technologies used in, for example, the microelectronics industry, are notable examples of newly-established industrial processes, which could provide benefits if implemented for fuel cells manufacturing.
Scope:
The projects will develop new, or adapt significantly different, manufacturing processes, already established in other high-volume manufacturing sectors, to replace the “FC-conventional” and cost-limiting processes employed in current pilot manufacturing lines for cells, stacks and stack components. The new processes will substitute entire manufacturing steps with new core process technologies or equipment. Once developed and validated, the new steps will be integrated into already existing pilot plants or full-scale manufacturing plant.
The innovative manufacturing technologies will need to be more efficient and less expensive than the techniques currently in use. The new manufacturing processes will also consider environmental aspects and aim at a reduced materials and energy use.
It is expected that projects will exploit the possibilities given by mature technologies, which will ultimately guarantee a combination of cost reduction with an increase in volume production, quality and cell performance.
The scope of each proposal is required to address the following main activities:
Identify at least two mature methodologies from other industries, whose implementation for the production of cells, stack components or stacks, could significantly improve their production process as specified hereafter.
For the identified methodologies, demonstrate the advancements with respect to the solutions currently in use and the benefits achievable for:
production process: cycle time, yield, materials input, reliability of the production process, product reproducibility and increased control over specifications.
manufacturing costs: cost of production line (i.e. less capital investment), operating costs (i.e. less expensive), energy input (i.e. more efficient), product quality (i.e. low variability);
cell/stack performance: power density, efficiency, degradation.
Down select the most promising new process for extensive manufacturing development and implementation and evaluation on existing small production lines or pilot plants and quantify and verify the expected benefits.
Evaluate in a consistent framework the performance and the quality of the cell, stack or stack components against the performance of those manufactured with one of the traditional methodologies.
Identify the limiting development factors of the other methodology/methodologies – not selected for the production testing – then improve the features and capabilities to reduce the gap towards the implementation within a medium time horizon (i.e. after the project end).
The projects shall
produce a sufficient volume of components by the new process to validate its capability and to enable the assembly and testing of at least two existing stack designs relevant to a practical stationary application;
demonstrate that innovative manufacturing routes can be scaled above 50 MW per year in a single production line while maintaining their competitive advantage.
The topic is not intended to cover the establishment of pilot or full-scale manufacturing plants, or basic research on new materials, or fundamentally new cell and stack designs.
The proposal has to include how the project strengthens the European industry and favours the creation of European anchored jobs.
Consortia should include at least one stack manufacturer and include a description of their supply chain including European companies. It is expected the involvement of industries or SMEs who may benefit from the creation of a new supply chain ready for larger production compared to the state-of-the-art.
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity from the Industry or from the Research Grouping.
MRL start: 3
MRL end: 6
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
Expected Impact:
Worldwide cost and quality leadership in cells and stacks can be achieved through this call, as cost-effective equipment and processes are essential to counterbalance somewhat higher labour costs in the EU. Innovative technologies will allow a more efficient and better controlled raw materials distribution into the electrodes, waste reduction, higher flexibility and reproducibility in terms of size and shape with respect to current technologies (e.g. tape casting, spray-drying, screen printing etc.). Moreover the new processes should guarantee the enhancement of cell performance towards the increase of power density, efficiency and durability. A successful project shall
demonstrate the potential cost reduction and scalability of the improved processes and assess their impact on EU competitiveness;
enable the production equipment manufacturers to open fuel cell manufacturing as a new market segment and generate and secure highly qualified jobs within the EU.
The projects should aim at a strong contribution to go clearly beyond the targets envisaged in the MAWP 2014 – 2020 (page 35) that could be achieved by simply following the established routes. Projects will demonstrate the achievement of cost reduction, as well as quality and performance improvement with respect to the following KPIs:
Specific KPIs for SOFC:
Stack Capex < 400 € /kW.
Power density > 0.35 W/cm2.
Degradation < 1.5% after a year test including 50 thermal cycles. Reference test conditions are reformate gas with S/C around 2 and fuel utilisation above 75%.
Lifetime expectation > 40000 h including typical start-/stop requirements for operations, maintenance and emergency shut-downs.
Specific KPIs for PEMFC:
Stack capex < 350 € /kW.
Power density > 0.67 W/cm2.
Degradation < 0.25%/1000 h.
Lifetime expectation > 20000 h.
Proposals should clearly report testing and operation conditions for a consistent assessment of the targeted KPIs.
The projects will pave the way towards the establishment of supply-chains with a positive impact on the creation of new jobs by enlarging the application of mature production methodologies to the fuel cells sector. This would also help to shift traditional production towards more added value components, leading to an increase in high profile jobs. Therefore, it is expected that the successful projects will make a valuable contribution to the achievement of other EU societal objectives (i.e. industry and economy growth, as well as jobs creation). Thus this will demonstrate that Europe will become a global leader in high volume and low cost fuel cell production, especially compared to Asia and America. Moreover, as a global leader, the reduction in imports from outside Europe could also be addressed together with the likely growth of the export market."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The combination of variable renewable energy, electrolysers and geological stores can provide a means for capturing and holding renewable energy at scale. A fully renewable system in EU will require very large volumes of hydrogen storage and the ability to transfer hydrogen in/out of the stores at various rates across the day/year, with associated variations in pressure level. Considering this challenge, it is important to understand whether geological stores can be used in a time-varying cyclic manner to accept high charge and discharge rates, together with any impacts on the gas transportation system or downstream applications.
Hydrogen storage in salt caverns is well established, but salt caverns have not been subjected to time-varying rates of hydrogen input and output to reflect the variable profiles of renewable power and hydrogen/energy demand (as will be required if they are to act as a dynamic buffering option to enable sector coupling and a more resilient energy system).
Scope:
The main objective of this topic is to examine the feasibility of cycling a salt cavern, fed by an electrolyser that follows an intermittent renewable power profile while hydrogen is discharged from the cavern to cover a specific hydrogen demand. This should provide a better understanding of how to integrate and balance intermittent renewables in the EU energy system. The results should offer sufficient learnings for decisions on scaling-up large underground storage of renewable hydrogen.
A suitable salt cavern should be identified for undertaking a pilot scale demonstration involving a MW scale electrolyser and essential infrastructure equipment. The size of the cavern, the electrolyser and the profile of hydrogen demand should be such that over the duration of the project the cavern will be cycled a few hundred times, e.g. at least daily cycling.
The transient performance of the system should be assessed in a temporally precise manner when it is subjected to a variety of relevant renewable input and hydrogen/energy demand profiles. The electrolyser response times should be compliant with providing grid services in future balancing markets, as may be required to achieve a fully renewable energy system. Through an extensive test and demonstration programme, the project should establish the technical (geological, geochemical, microbiological) and economic capabilities and limitations of salt caverns to act like a ‘lung’ for the energy system (absorbing variable renewable energy and discharging hydrogen as required to match supply and demand across very different periods and response times).
For this demonstration pilot, preferably hydrogen produced directly from renewable sources should be used for providing the working volume, while the cushion gas may come from other sources. “CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform [61].
The application model to be considered in the project should be parameterised (e.g. the fuel utilization factor with respect to the overall amount of pressurized fuel stored in the cavern), in order to identify positive business cases and the highest replication potential of the pilot case in caverns of various size. To achieve a deep understanding of how the project could be scaled up and applied across the EU energy system, it should study a real case of sector coupling by considering one or a combination of the following options: hydrogen consumption by the industrial sector, hydrogen mobility, injection into the gas grid (of hydrogen or synthetic methane) and stationary power generation.
It is expected that the replicability and scalability of the project would be fundamental to facilitating further deployments of renewable hydrogen storage underground in salt caverns. The project should therefore liaise with relevant bodies and other projects to share and disseminate learnings including RCS issues.
TRL at start of the project: 5 and TRL at the end of the project: 7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
The project consortium should involve geologists to undertake expert analyses for any structural, geochemical or other effects that the cycling of the cavern with hydrogen could lead to.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In order to fight climate change, the need to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases will force the chemical industry to find alternate paths to the conventional fossil carbon sources. A significant number of existing and future value chains require carbon monoxide (CO) in addition to hydrogen. Even at high rates of direct electrification scenarios that include the use of biomass, there is still a demand for carbon (C). At EU level, this is in the range of millions of tons/year [62] (corresponding to GWs of energy demand if derived from CO2) due to following reasons:
Carbon (C) is a building block in basic chemicals such as aviation fuels and alloys and is responsible for 20% of crude oil usage in the EU. It can hardly be replaced by direct electrification or pure hydrogen;
CO has a stronger binding enthalpy to oxygen (O2). Redox processes, e.g. ore reduction, can run at lower temperatures (and therefore fewer complex materials) with CO than with pure H2.
Carbon is either part of a product directly from crude oil or derived from fossil syngas (H2 + CO). Similarly to hydrogen, most of the syngas nowadays is produced by steam methane reformers (SMR) which emit more than 6 kg of CO2 per kg of syngas. Industrial Power-to-X Plants require quantities of syngas in scales of minimum 20 MW while the standard scale will be more than 100MW.
The general challenge is to supply green syngas at a competitive cost and in the MW range in order to be relevant to the industrial applications that will still rely on carbon in the future.
High temperature steam electrolysis based on Solid Oxide Cell (SOC) technology can perform the co-electrolysis of CO2 to CO along with hydrogen production. This directly creates syngas (H2 + CO) at high system efficiencies of 80% (LHV SynGas/kWh AC) and high conversion rates (>80%), already demonstrated at low TRL by previous FCH 2 JU projects and national projects (e.g. Kopernikus [63] or ECo [64]).
The specific challenge is to scale up to the MW range and advance it to a TRL that is relevant for industrial syngas consumers while getting the cost of green syngas close to the steam reformer level.

Scope:
This topic calls for the development, manufacturing, commissioning and operation of an industrial size co-electrolysis system, based on SOC technology. This should be demonstrated in an industrial environment with the following goals:
Fully equipped system including CO2, steam, electricity supply and the conditioning of all feed and product streams (especially the cleaning of CO2 from contaminants) as well as the compression of the syngas to the pressure required by the consumer;
Net output of at least 80 kg pure (2 H2:CO) syngas/h, used to substitute fossil-based syngas, which corresponds to approximately 700 kWAc;
Demonstration for two years with an expected production of 500-900 tons of syngas at >95% availability. Part load operation to handle flexible loads is also expected and the demonstration should be concluded without the need for a stack replacement;
The power consumption at Beginning-of-Life (BOL) should be less than 8.5 kWh AC/kg of syngas and the production loss rate should be less than 1.2%/kh;
Stack box reference tests should be performed in order to analyse root causes of degradation. Degradation caused on stack and system level should be separately investigated. Consequences of gas flow and temperature inhomogeneity as well as impacts from critical operating conditions should be analysed;
It should be able to demonstrate a pathway that achieves a CAPEX of less than €480/kg/day and operation and maintenance cost of less than €24/kg/day by 2024. Recommendations on how to reach these targets should be given;
CO2 and steam should be sourced from existing streams, while electricity should be sourced renewably by a direct connection to a renewable power source or through a contractual relationship (e.g. PPA). “CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform;
The co-electrolyser should be benchmarked against the operational range of the fossil source process (SMR). This benchmarking should be done with respect to the H2:CO ratio as well as part load capability (from min to max in <5 minutes for grid services);
All data derived from the operation and the market such as feed stream purchasing, product sales and additional income streams should be used to create a techno-economic analysis. It is expected that an LCA will be conducted and that the GHG mitigation potential and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) will be calculated in order to derive a business model that encourages the use of co-electrolysis over fossil sources. Recommendations for adaptations in the relevant legal frameworks should be made.
The values above are expressed for the standard syngas composition of 2H2:CO. Different use cases might require different stoichiometry, e.g. higher CO content. For those cases, equivalent targets should be developed and proposed by the applicants.
The consortium should include the co-electrolysis system manufacturer and the industrial syngas consumer.
TRL at start: 5 and TRL at the end of the project: 7
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell or electrolyser components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 4 years
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to demonstrate a path forward to the reduction of carbon-emissions from the chemical industry in EU. The most important impact is the industrial operation of the world´s largest co-electrolyser, which will be perceived as “MW scale” in comparison to legacy water electrolysis, although it may take in less than one MW electric power due to its high efficiency.
Due to the scale-up factor it is expected that industrial components will be used offering a reduction in the overall costs of a co-electrolysis system.
A very important impact is the increased trustworthiness for this technology by achieving the following goals:
At least 12,000 operational hours with less than 1.2%/kh production loss rate;
Electricity consumption at rated capacity and at beginning of life (BOL) that will be less than 8.5 kWh AC/kg of syngas without compression. This equals to about 80% electrical efficiency (LHV SynGas/kWh AC), which is below the MAWP target of 202465 for pure steam electrolysis since co-electrolysis is more complex;
Availability of 95% which is 3% less than the 98% MAWP target for 2024 for this new technology for the same reason as above;
An expected capital cost reduction to €480/kg/day and operation and maintenance cost reduction to less than €24/kg/day;
A detailed degradation analysis and the identification of measures to lower degradation in the future;
The project is expected to demonstrate the scale up of SOC co-electrolysis which will be necessary in order to decarbonise chemical feedstock;
The project is expected to produce high quality data for LCA, GHG mitigation potential and TCO calculations. Additionally, a business model is expected as well as recommendations for adaptations of the relevant regulatory framework. The above should enable the replication of such business propositions following the completion of the project.
With the successful completion of such a project, co-electrolysis shall show its potential to largely contribute to sectoral integration as well as grid balancing by utilizing existing infrastructure and by enlarging the reach of green hydrogen to industrial areas that are today only accessible for fossil syngas or fossil hydrocarbons.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The electrical demand in the European countries is estimated to increase to be three times the level of the year 2000 by 2020. Utility companies are facing already increasing difficulties to accommodate escalating power demands and fluctuating loads from renewable electricity sources.
The main challenges to be addressed are:
The need for distributed power production for commercial and industrial applications for base load and redundant energy supply and as a supporting alternative to conventional central power plants.
Need for high energy efficiency and reduction of emissions, because the alternative power supply for these applications is mostly emitting high amount of CO2, noise and other emission
The need for flexible power solutions supporting the further integration of renewable energy in the energy system
Increase of energy efficiency and power security
The Roland Berger study “Advancing Europe’s energy systems: Stationary fuel cells in distributed generations” (2015) also mentions “Whilst European power grids are still amongst the most reliable in the world, critical infrastructure providers and businesses with sensitive applications are becoming increasingly interested in decoupling the availability of electricity from the grid and becoming more independent.”
The key markets are base load operations, also in CHP configuration, for data centres, commercial buildings, industries, logistics and security networks that need to improve energy efficiency and power security, and grid support.
Scope:
The goal of this topic is to provide an overarching connection in the energy landscape, based on integration of available FCH technologies for distributed power production in the evolving grid infrastructure. The project shall explicitly strengthen the European value chain for critical components such as fuel cell stack, power electronics in connection with fuel cells and remote control.
This demonstration in 100-400 kW power range will make fuel cell based distributed power production more visible in the European countries. It demonstrates that several European manufacturers of FC systems in the 100-400 kW power range are ready to initiate the drive to achieving economies of scale and hence significantly reduce costs enabling further roll-outs/deployment.
In such context of distributed power generation, the main objectives of the topic are to support the performance and technical viability of fuel cell systems implemented in various sites in Europe. Such decentralized base load power generation systems will be implemented while respecting the European industrial requirements of related applications in commercial sector: CHP in commercial buildings, industries, hospitals, airports; grid support for offering balancing services for safe operation of electricity system as alternative to conventional power plants, in pilot plant configuration.
This project includes fuel cell systems in the power range of 100-400kW with a total installed capacity of at least 1MW. Such numbers will allow progress on standardisation, cost reduction and will address different requirements and applications to compare solutions coming from different European industries. The project also helps to increase the public awareness of fuel cell systems as a valuable alternative compared to conventional systems across Europe.
The project can address one or several customer segments. The FC system applications will be demonstrated at minimum 3 different sites in three different European countries in order to contribute to introduction of the FC technology across Europe. The project demonstrates solutions from minimum 3 different manufacturers of FC products in order to demonstrate the technological capabilities and to cooperate on mutual challenges such as standardisation and communication. The project will be open to all fuel cell technologies. The project is also open for different fuel sources for the fuel cells, but hydrogen from renewable sources should be considered where possible. Electrolyser costs are not included.
Heat and/or cooling from the CHP should also be utilized where possible to drive up the overall energy efficiency.
Project proposals should prove the readiness of fuel cell solutions for CHP applications and the possibility to roll out the fuel cell technology in that large market segment for power supply solutions, also considering eco-efficiency principles for value added and the applicability to grid support.
Further objectives:
Demonstration, evaluation and optimization of new solutions and components especially at the FC stack level and/or on systems levels through field tests with improved product concepts e.g. pre-serial status as compared to previous field trials, by validating next generations of product designs.
Demonstration through field applications of the advantages of innovative technologies (hardware or software) including, but not limited to, monitoring, control, diagnosis, lifetime estimation, new BoP components.
Development of scaling models, prediction of energy needs combined with fuel-cell performance including demand side management (DSM) for dispersed energy production system including FC systems and supporting the increased share of RES
Online monitoring of operating conditions, load demands and system output will provide initial data to determine the overall efficiency of the system within the testing period.
Establishment of a demonstration/commercialization pathway for European SMEs innovating in the development, manufacture and supply chain of fuel cell products by involvement of customers including distributors and end users.
Field demonstration usage data, efficiency, reliability are to be reported. Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html.
TRL at start: 6
TRL at end: 7-8
The consortium should include at least three fuel cell manufacturers providing each a minimum of 100kW and additionally relevant customers from the commercial and or industrial sector. Research institutions and academic groups could be also included. The total installed power should be at least 1MW.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 7.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-5 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
The suggested topic embodies the opportunity to connect substantial research (scaling models, prediction of energy needs combined with fuel-cell performance) with innovative industrial practices (system development and engineering against actual configurations). Moreover, it has high social impact, thus opening the fuel-cell research and innovation world to industrial and utilities.
Moreover, significant attention should be paid to improvements in the technical and economic performance of the FC products including stacks, BoP components and their manufacturing.
Reduction of CAPEX at a level of less than 6,000€/kW
Increase of system lifetime of more than 15 years and increase of maintenance interval
Improve of electrical efficiency of all possible applications in this topic in the range of 42-55% or CHP efficiency of more than 90%.
The fuel cell systems should demonstrate smart grid operation – modulating power output; sales to grid at peak prices and reduction of power output at lower grid prices.
The fuel cell systems should demonstrate heat and/or cooling utilization to drive up overall efficiency of the systems, modulating heat/power output
This demonstration must not only raise public awareness; it should be used to establish confidence in technology, business models and market readiness with end-users and authorities. It should also confirm the readiness of the technology in the CHP market or to adjust power generation in response to grid signals from a Smart Grid and thereby provide improved stability to the grid."

Specific challenge: The maturity level of several fuel cell technologies is ready to achieve a market entry of fuel cell power plants in the most challenging market segments, i.e. commercial or industrial (50 kW - 10 MW). This is a way to meaningfully reduce harmful emissions like GHG (through improved energy efficiency of using natural gas and utilization of renewable fuels including biogas and/or green hydrogen) and emissions of NOx, SOx and PM (particles) and also to assure the security of power supply (through decentralized power production).
The realization of large scale demonstration projects are needed to build up confidence/acceptance of the various stakeholders (electricity/heat producers, public, politicians, investors etc.) and applications to reduce the market entry barriers and to commercialize the technology. These demonstration projects are needed for confidence building to trigger volume scale up with large scale orders. This leads to higher installed capacity and therefore to lower cost.
The main focus of this area would be in reduction of use of primary energy by efficient and direct conversion of chemical energy (hydrogen, biogas, natural gas and other hydrocarbons, power to gas, industrial waste gases etc.) into power in a decentralized power production to reduce losses due to transmission and distribution.
In order to increase competitiveness against standard CHP there is a goal to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO in €/kWh) in the direction of grid costs and competitive total costs of energy in different applications.
Scope:  Deploy example FC solutions in commercial or industrial market segments through strong partnerships between end users, industry, SMEs, local authorities, and FC suppliers.
The projects will target primarily demonstration of solutions integrating the following:
•             50 kW up to several MW capacity production of power and heat from natural gas, biogas or hydrogen
•             Integration of a FC power plant in industrial/commercial processes
The project should aim at creating partnerships between end users, industry, local SMEs, financiers and local authorities, in order to ensure that the solutions are replicated and can be financed through various sources.
Therefore each project should:
•             Validate real demonstration units in commercial applications will enable suppliers, various stake holders and end users to gain experience throughout the value chain
•             Develop and reinforce business plans and service strategies (e.g. refurbishment of stacks at end of life, full service offers etc.) during the project and Life Cycle Analysis that will be replicable and validated in other market segments after the project
•             Have a clearly defined structure, with roles and responsibilities properly spelled out for all involved entities
Cleaning of the fuel is out of scope of this topic.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to have the impacts described below:
•             Supplier and user experience of installation/commissioning, operation and use of distributed power generation
•             Building and validating references to build trust among the stakeholders
•             Enable active participation of consumers in order to bring the fuel cells technology closer to their daily business

o             Total efficiency > 70% (heat cycle: 45°C/30°C)
•             Reduction of the CAPEX (no transport, installation, project management, no heat use equipment) to
o             < 7,000 €/kW for systems < 1 MW
o             < 4,000 €/kW for systems ≥ 1 MW

to < 0.05 €/kWh
•             Reduce the overall energy costs

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Conversion of biogas (anaerobic digester- or landfill gas) to hydrogen is an energy efficient and low cost pathway for production of renewable hydrogen. The current available catalysts and reactor systems degrade rapidly in time due to carbon formation on the catalyst, reactor and heat exchanger walls due to the high carbon content of biogas.
The state of the art conversion of biogas therefore consists of first cleaning the biogas from impurities like sulphur, siloxanes and subsequent upgrading the biogas by removing the CO2. The resulting methane-rich feed is reformed by state of the art SMR. The upgrading step results in high capital and operational costs and lowers the efficiency of the process.
The challenge is to remove the upgrading step and convert clean biogas (still containing CO2) directly into hydrogen.
Scope:  The scope of work comprises the development and testing of catalysts and reactor designs in order to obtain a continuous and stable process for hydrogen production through direct reforming of clean biogas. It includes a proof of concept of an optimized system with adequate control strategies. The final target should be to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of the total process.
The project should focus on:
•             Conception of low cost and energy efficient systems to produce renewable hydrogen from biogas. Assessment of performance in terms of CO2 footprint and cost per produced amount of H2
•             Increasing High Heating Value (HHV) efficiency up to 72% (clean biogas to hydrogen)
•             Eliminate the upgrading steps of the feedstock by developing catalytic and reactor systems that are more stable in time due to a lower susceptibility to degradation by carbonaceous material fouling or poisoning by impurities
•             Design, build and operate a reactor for the continuous production of hydrogen at a pre-commercial scale (between 50 and 250 kg/day), displaying an improvement with respect to the current state of the art
•             Adjust Balance of Plant components and burner unit to safely operate with lower caloric value gas streams
Biogas cleaning (removal of impurities like sulphur, siloxanes, ammonia) is not within the scope of the topic.
Projects should build upon knowledge and experience from relevant previously funded FCHJU projects.
Expected impact:
•             Fuel cell technology for reforming of CO2-containing biogas should be demonstrated in relevant environment
•             Improved efficiency of reforming anaerobic fermentation or landfill gas up to 72%
•             Reduced cost of reforming biogas"

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:          A recent FCH JU “Development of water electrolysis in the European Union” has acknowledged both the potential and importance of using central large scale electrolysis for provision of grid balancing and energy storage purposes in European regions with increasing share of intermittent renewable energy. Intelligent operation of the electrolyser in periods with excess or lack of renewable electricity production could help balance the grid and store energy.
This conceptual use of electrolysis is however faced with several challenges that are to be addressed by large scale demonstration. As for existing technologies such as central power plants the use of electrolysis for provision of grid balancing services alone is not sufficient for a feasible business case. Where power plants needs several electricity production hours per year to supplement grid balancing revenue, electrolysis needs multiple high value markets where the produced hydrogen can be stored, distributed and used. This is in particular of importance if green electrolysis hydrogen is to be cost competitive with central SMR fossil production.  
Recent years of R&D have significantly improved the production ramp up and down flexibility of electrolysis technology and improved the scalability from kW to MW size. What is still lacking is large scale infield demonstration as sites where both multiple grid services are required and where hydrogen at the same time can be distributed and offered for multiple high value markets, such as e.g. industrial gases, transport fuel and power-to-gas. Only such applications can provide both the scale for providing grid balancing and reaching cost levels where additional revenue can be generated from hydrogen distribution and sales.   
Little evidence has been gathered yet of the way electrolysers could operate to maximise their benefits to the grid and revenues from hydrogen supply to multiple markets.
This demonstration call seeks proposals which demonstrate state of the art electrolyser technologies providing and receiving revenue by providing these balancing services, whilst distributing (and receiving revenues from) hydrogen for high value markets.
Scope:  The objective of the project is to deploy and monitor state of the art (2015) electrolyser systems and supporting hydrogen distribution and supply systems configured to attract revenues from grid services in addition to providing hydrogen for multiple high value markets.
The scope of the project should include efforts such as:
•             Large scale electrolyser in excess of 1 MW must be tested in order to be in relationship with the grid scale. Power installed should be duly justified along with the advantages offered to the grid and the resulting long term business model
•             This topic focuses on the inclusion of specific improvements of the current SoA related to the electrolyser operation under partial loads, quick response, system for reserve and frequency response services, forecasting models for electricity price and renewable energy production
•             The technology must demonstrate an electricity consumption of 55 - 60 kWh/kgH2; capital cost of 930 EUR/kW for alkaline electrolysers and 1,570 EUR/kWh for PEM electrolysers. Those target costs do not include the specific tailoring of the electrolysis to be compatible with the grid services to be brought
•             Electrolyser system operators will demonstrate that they are able to benefit from grid services revenue streams. Here, the consortium will demonstrate that they are able to obtain these revenues by entering into commercial contracts with the grid operators or utilities who value these services
•             A comprehensive operation plan must be put in place. State of the art electrolysers and downstream systems must be installed and operated for a minimum period of two years
•             Electrolysers systems will demonstrate a sufficient level of responsiveness to meet the requirements of the grid services they will seek to offer (e.g. rapid modulation, rapid start, as required by the services offered to the grid)
•             Proportional scaled hydrogen distribution and supply systems for downstream provision of the produced hydrogen will be valuable strong added value for the proposal, as e.g. innovative hydrogen distribution concepts for industrial gas or transport fuel applications and/or power-to-gas. Correspondingly, the distribution and supply concepts for downstream hydrogen provision should show improvement on scale and current market utilization. In order to the hydrogen to final customers, activities may include the hydrogen distribution and supply systems and market access, such as innovative trailers and filling port and connection concepts at industrial gas customers. Safety of such innovative solutions shall be fully assessed, as part of the project. Additionally local hydrogen pipeline grids or power-to-gas applications can also be included 
A technology neutral approach is envisaged, not precluding any of the different technologies. Furthermore, various technologies may apply in the same project and regulatory regimes, while strongly promoting cross-over learning, which enriches the knowledge obtained, provided sufficient information exchange among participating stakeholders and with the broader community is put in place.
Eligible consortia should reflect the value chain for the business case considered, such as for instance electrolyser and hydrogen technology developers, electricity grid operators, gas companies, HRS network operators, industrial hydrogen customers, utilities and energy companies. Specifically, the partnership must include strong links to:
•             the necessary contractual and commercial expertise to access revenues from the grid services
•             technical expertise for the design, provision and operation of the electrolyser and associated hydrogen distribution and supply technologies
•             market access for downstream provision of hydrogen for high value markets such as industrial gas, transport fuel or power-to-gas
It will be valuable if consortia build upon already feasible business cases, so that potential customers (transport use, industry or utility) do not discontinue the use of the installation after project end, but on the contrary support continued market roll-out efforts.
Expected impact: The proposal is expected to demonstrate in an operational environment state of the art electrolysis technology configured to attract revenues from grid services in addition to providing hydrogen for multiple high value markets.
The consortium will ensure that actions are included in the project in order to generate learning and reach KPI and commercial targets, such as:
•             Confirm and validate feasible operation of large scale central electrolysis, together with the necessary grid interfaces as well as hydrogen distribution and supply systems that captures revenue from balancing services and sale of hydrogen for multiple markets
•             The environmental performance of the system – with a particular attention to the CO2 intensity of the hydrogen produced, which should include an understanding of the CO2 impact of the grid services mode selected and CO2 footprint impact in the addressed hydrogen end-user markets
•             Techno-economic analysis of the performance of these systems
•             Projections of the value and size of the markets addressed by provision of the grid balancing services and supply to multiple hydrogen markets
•             Assessment and operation experience of the contractual and hardware arrangements required to access the balancing services and operate the electrolyser systems
•             Assessment and operation experience, including safety, of the contractual and hardware arrangements required to distribute and supply hydrogen to multiple markets such as industrial gas, transport fuel and/or power-to-gas
•             Assessment of the legislative and RCS implications of these systems and any issues identified in obtaining consents to operate the system
•             Recommendations for policy makers and regulators on measures required to stimulate the market for these systems
Public-facing versions of these ‘lessons learnt’ reports should be prepared and disseminated across Europe and potentially wider"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The market for fuel cells in small-power applications (between 0.3 and 5 kWe), is progressively taking shape worldwide. The most promising application, in terms of societal and environmental impact, is the residential micro Combined Heat and Power (µCHP), as suggested by the study Advancing Energy Systems (reference 1) published by FCH-JU in 2015. Other small-scale applications (telecom towers, data centers, HVAC, remote power, small commercial etc.) use the same technical platform and may provide a quicker market uptake. The Japanese industry, thanks to its ambitious ENE-FARM program, has taken the lead in technology development in this field, and is enjoying economies of scale. In Europe, a much smaller-scale effort is underway, in a more fragmented market.
Until now, PEMFC (Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell) technology dominates the market with Intellectual Property largely in the hands of Japanese groups. However, ceramic-based technologies, in particular SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cells), still pose as a promising alternative for future systems.
Despite its recognized potential, the SOFC technology still needs to mature on specific dimensions at cell, stack and hotbox levels (such as material sets, manufacturability and components design), in order to fulfill the cost and performance demands of the small-power customer– typically a long lifetime (10 years), high electrical efficiency (55% to 60% or more) and acceptable cost (less than 15 000 €/kW for a system). Moreover, working on next-generation, disruptive technology will allow European industries and consumers to avoid depending on Asian-imported technology.
The main challenge that this project intends to address is to develop a next generation Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) stack/hotbox technical platform for small stationary applications, which is fully competitive with today’s integrated Japanese SOFC power modules, and which satisfies fully the European customers’ needs while leveraging the European supply chain.
Scope:
The goal of the topic is to foster the development of next-generation SOFC stack and/or hotbox/ integrated stack module technology, of European ownership, as a technical platform serving small-power (<5 kWe) stationary applications, including but not limited to Residential µCHP, by improving:
Product design: increasing the electrical efficiency and the durability of the ceramic-based cells, stack and ancillary hotbox components used for small-power CHP and power-only production, while reducing costs, in order to secure a clear value proposition to the final customer compared to conventional solutions;
Manufacturability: integrating industrialization considerations into the design, from the start, by implementing world-class ceramic technologies, with high-volume, low cost / high productivity characteristics, in the field of forming, sintering / depositing, finishing and assembly. These ceramic technologies should be easily scalable in the future to ensure the cost-down potential;
Standards and European Supply Chain integration: cooperating between European component and system manufacturers to solidify EU supply chains, and define battery limits compatible for integration. Those agreed battery limits will be publicly available also to other EU stack manufacturers not participating;
Intellectual Property: strengthening European technology leadership by leveraging the European industry’s capabilities and ceramic know-how, and consolidating IP positions with European ownership.
In order to solve the challenge the project is expected to include some of the following tasks:
the elaboration of advanced ceramic-based cell structure and design, including innovative electrolyte / electrodes / interconnect layers;
new material sets allowing better durability, electrical efficiency, low cost and better processability;
high productivity / low cost ceramic manufacturing processes (raw material batch preparation, green forming, sintering / depositing, finishing, assembly);
novel geometries and designs for the stack and ancillary hotbox/integrated stack module components (insulation, gas manifold, electrical connections, heat exchangers etc.);
Within the project, the following will be performed:
the design and development of (at least) one 1 kWe cell stack (potentially integrated into a hotbox/integrated stack module) prototype;
a test-bench demonstration of performance under application-relevant test conditions, including a durability run lasting more than 5000 consecutive hours, start-up and shut down cycles, dynamic load cycles, fuel quality (hydrogen, reformed gases);
a detailed cost model allowing to assess economic benefits of such new stack options in comparison with more conventional solutions.
A collaboration mechanism needs to be developed with the JRC, in relation to the ongoing EU protocol harmonisation and validation activities performed in support of the FCH2-JU programme.
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity from the Industry and from the Research Grouping.
TRL 3 at start to TRL 5 at the end.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
The projects are expected to contribute to validate the targets contained in the MAWP 2014–2020, or even go beyond, in particular the specific KPIs related to small-power (<5 kWe) stationary applications, including but not limited to Residential µCHP, using SOFC / ceramic-based technologies. It is believed that if the following criteria are met, the SOFC system’s performance and economics will be suitable for a market take-off.
Stack performance in commercially relevant assembly (note : not individual cell performance): DC efficiency of at least 55%, for example by achieving voltage 0.83 V/cell at current density 0.30 A/cm2 under reformed natural gas and air. Operating conditions : air utilization >35% and fuel utilization >65%
Lifetime > 90 000 hours (defined as accumulated performance loss reaching 20%) :
Steady state degradation rate <0.1% per thousand hours, proven over a test duration of at least 5000 hours
Resistance to normal cycling : <0.01% per cycle (controlled shut-down with stack brought to T<125°C) proven over at least 50 cycles
Resistance to emergency shut-down : <0.25% per cycle (redox cycle such as fuel loss at operational temperature, specific to the system outlay) proven over at least 10 cycles
Stack Cost: below 1000 €/KWe ultimately, as manufactured in a production plant with a capacity of > 50 MWe/y. This stack cost includes not only the cells but also the gas manifold, current collectors, compression systems, and potentially insulations and heat exchangers depending on the design;"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Pushed by the major trend of digitalization and the internet of things, the market demands more and more highly reliable, continuous power supply (prime power) for data-centres. It is expected that data-centres will use up to 4% of world’s energy consumption in the next few years. Most of the visible hyper scale data-centres (100 MW) are nowadays built in cold remote areas in proximity of renewable energy sources, primary wind and hydro power and where free cooling is available.
The more numerous but more discrete smaller “edge data centres”, situated close to the end-user, have also experienced a strong growth in cities and urban areas. Much smaller in scale, they offer an increased service level to the end-users expecting very fast data response time where every millisecond counts in customer experience. The power density of the data-servers has more than doubled over the last few years, allowing to increase the data treatment capacity within the same space, while the availability of electric power is becoming increasingly a constraint in those areas. Often it is simply not possible to increase the power supply in cities like London and Frankfurt, as the power distribution infrastructure is already extensively loaded.
The challenge is to overcome the constraints in the existing electrical infrastructure without increasing local emissions using solutions that are efficient from an energy and an economic point of view. This creates an opportunity for distributed generation. In addition, city centres often practice stringent policies to reduce and avoid emissions like NOx, SOx, particulate matter and noise, to protect the health of their inhabitants. This limits the use of power generation using combustion engines. Fuel cell generators can adequately address all these challenges as they can provide high power density within buildings or on roof tops and highly reliable power supply at acceptable cost levels.
An appropriate overall data-centre architecture is required to address all aspects simultaneously, particularly the redundancy to provide high reliability and availability.
Furthermore, edge data-centres are often located in large commercial buildings like banks and insurance buildings, hotels and hospitals, offering the opportunity for the use of the by-product heat. This can be realised either within the building itself or by providing the heat to a nearby district heating system. An appropriate thermal design provides the opportunity to reach higher total efficiencies relative to other conventional technologies at the same scale.
Scope:
The project aims at demonstrating a highly reliable power supply to data-centres within urban areas where grid power supply is limited due to infrastructure constraints and where combustion-based combined heat and power (CHP) is not admissible due to emissions regulation.
The project will develop a building integrated solution using fuel cells that are adapted and suited to the requirements for strong load modulation, electrical integration/connection to the data centre and heat recovery for use in the building or a district heating network.
The solutions developed in the project should:
Provide an appropriate data-centre electricity supply architecture based on fuel cells modules to provide a 99.999% availability to the data-centre;
Supply at least 50 kWe of power to the data centre. The architecture developed should be modular, easily scalable to other system capacities and able to provide the five 9 (99.999%) availability;
Demonstrate the solution developed in an operational environment (real data centre) for at least 8,000 hours;
Provide overall solutions that cope with the strongly varying load of data-centres;
Address service and maintenance requirements of both fuel cell modules and data servers in a coordinated manner to optimise the overall operating costs of the data-centre. This includes minimisation of system footprint and accessibility for maintenance;
Consider the suitability of using the heat generated from the fuel cell and data-centre server either to supply the building needs or to a nearby district heating system.
Projects should identify and/or develop business models aiming to foster the replication of the solutions developed in the project in other data centres.
The consortium is expected to include at least a system supplier based in the EU or H2020 Associated Country with proven track record of units running in the field and a data-centre infrastructure provider. Activities should build on the experiences and achievements of earlier projects and bring further cost reductions as a means to improve and strengthen the competitiveness of the EU fuel cell supplier industry.
TRL at start of the project: 5 (for the electrical architecture) to 6 (for the fuel cell) and TRL at the end of the project: 7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 2.5 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
Provision of solutions to supply the energy requirements of data centres located in urban areas that are reliable, modular, highly efficient and compatible with the requirements of the most stringent local air quality regulations;
Cost-effective solution to overcome constraints in the existing electrical infrastructure of city centres and urban areas without increasing local emissions;
Opening of new markets for EU suppliers including export opportunities for overseas markets. The project should provide business models for fuel cell and data centre providers planning to roll-out and implement the solutions developed in the project at scale;
After an initial deployment phase in electricity constraint areas, it is expected that the use cases will expand more generally throughout urban areas and that the resulting products are compatible with increasing amounts of hydrogen within the existing gas infrastructure.
The solutions developed should achieve the following KPIs:
Fuel cell system cost <€5,500/kWe;
Fuel cell system volume <225 l/kWe;
Single system availability of at least 98%;
Overall availability of power supply to data-centre at least 99.999%;
Electrical efficiency > 50% (methane LHV) and >45% (H2 LHV).

Specific challenge: Water electrolysis is considered to have the potential to provide cost competitive hydrogen with a very low associated carbon footprint in comparison to the current best available technology, which is central SMR (steam methane reforming). In order to achieve this goal by 2025 or 2030 at the latest, as suggested by the “Development of water electrolysis in the European Union” , electrolysers must at least halve their capital cost while reducing their electricity consumption by 10%.
Electrolyser technology priorities are specific to the different chemistries under development. They respond to the need to reduce cost while maintaining or improving performance and include work on advanced catalysts and membranes as well as system engineering. Alkaline electrolysers are most mature, followed by Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolysers. Other technologies include the anion exchange membrane (AEM) and the solid oxide electrolyser (SOEC). Each has promise for cost reduction and the solid oxide system, which operates at high temperature, could produce hydrogen with much lower electricity inputs than conventional electrolysers by adding energy to the process as heat. Considerable development of solid oxide systems is still required, however, to demonstrate robust systems.
Scope:  Proposals should address a combination of the following developments:
•             Reduction of electricity consumption
•             Simplification of systems, size reduction (e.g. through higher current density)
•             Reduction of capital cost and use of materials. Enhanced manufacturability. Less expensive materials
•             Scalability to multi-MW scale. Modularity
•             New component and conceptual systems for improved partial load behaviour and highly dynamic operation
•             New materials and component design less prone to degradation. Improved understanding of degradation mechanisms, particularly under dynamic operation
•             Better maintenance and higher reliability
Research and innovation activities will contribute to identify and explore improvements towards 2025 central KPIs, as prescribed by the study on “Development of water electrolysis in the European Union”, in decreasing electricity consumption and capital cost, improving durability and dynamic behaviour. A technology neutral approach is favoured, allowing all technologies, whether alkaline, PEM, SOEC or AEM, to propose its challenges and detailed scope of work. As KPIs for SOEC and AEM are not available in the study, proposals addressing these technologies should carefully justify the current state of the art and the potential evolution of the technology until 2025 to be commercially available and competitive ex aequo with the conventional electrolysis technologies.
Expected impact: Proposals are expected to attain cost competitiveness of electrolysis with central Steam Methane Reforming. Proposals should indicate how the technology solution can achieve MAWP targets regarding cost reduction, efficiency improvement and decrease of electricity consumption.
Identifying and validating incremental or break through improvements in materials, components and system concepts directed to set the basis for cost competitive electrolytic hydrogen compared with central SMR should be key drivers in projects led by electrolyser manufacturers, technologists and research institutes. Outcome of the projects must derive in new concepts validated in relevant environments."

It is estimated that 1.2 billion people will be without electricity access globally by 2025. A further 1 billion people are connected to unstable networks and are regularly exposed to power outages. It may thus be considered that 2.4 billion people (i.e. around 35% of the global population) are “under electrified”.
When the connection of a major distribution network to the transport network is not a feasible option from a technical and economic perspective, onsite energy is generated off-grid.
Islands are particularly concerned by this type of situation. Indeed, electricity generation there is guaranteed by diesel generating units, despite their high production costs and pollutant emissions simply due to the absence of simple and feasible alternatives.
This is a significant market, part of which is represented by installed diesel production capacity of 600GW, whose half is installed on off-grid sites.
Hydrogen is envisioned as a potential solution for completely off-grid remote areas in Europe (e.g. villages, alpine refuges, etc.). These locations cannot be isolated of the global hydrogen development due to their off-grid characteristic and need to be part of the hydrogen technologies development coupled to renewable systems taking into account their intrinsic characteristics, applications and business case scenarios. The potential use of the hydrogen produced is varied, such as mobility applications, industrial use, stationary heat, large back-up systems, telecommunications, etc. and it increases the potential access to hydrogen technologies to these areas.
The newly proposed solution of off-grid electrolysers can pave the way to efficient hydrogen production systems optimized for a given region. Indigenous off-grid hydrogen generation may occur at highly distributed level close to the point of use (e.g. dc-dc PV-electrolyser systems). It could be used also as an energy system able to assure the energy independence of small locations in a municipal area or industry park, relying as much as possible on renewable sources locally available.
Current electrolysers must be improved in order to match the operation conditions linked to an off-grid and stand-alone scenario (dynamic operation, unpredictability of operation profiles, high robustness and reliability, low maintenance, etc.). Electrolyser manufacturers still need to improve some systems of the technology in order to work at variable load profiles efficiently, high efficiency at broad operating range and cost competitiveness. Proper design of these electrolysers in the range of 50-100 kW for off-grid applications must focus on developments at stack level, power electronics and balance of plant components and system engineering.
Scope:
Proposals must address the following objectives:
Development of off-grid electrolysers (alkaline or PEM technology) optimized at component and system levels, supplied by renewable energy sources - RE (e.g. solar PV and small wind energy), achieving MAWP 2017 target for electrolyser systems of 6M€/tpd capacity, high efficiency consistent with MAWP targets (<55kWh/kg by 2017 for electrolyser systems), high annual hydrogen yield and capacity factor with respect to the RE considering the constraints of dynamic operation
Development of power conversion and balance-of-plant hardware adapted to operate electrolysers in variable power mode, necessary for the off-grid system to perform efficiently, taking into account system topology (DC-DC, AC-DC, etc.) and grid constraints
Development of a control system with the capability of smart integration in off-grid installations and RE generation forecasting
In-field testing in relevant environment (TRL 6) is required (relevant environment is understood as existing renewable systems in off-grid conditions – e.g. PV system, small wind energy - in the range of 50-100 kW) for at least 6 months
Proposals could address the additional following objectives:
Developments at stack level in order to operate properly the electrolyser in a broad operation load profiles taking into account each installation and at high dynamic operation
System engineering in order to decrease the maintenance costs and frequency and increase reliability, robustness and lifetime
Identification of eventual RCS barriers between the technology and the business cases identified
Potential uses of hydrogen should be explored
Expected Impact:
Electrolyser efficiency consistent with MAWP targets by 2017 for electrolyser systems (<55kWh/kg), when converted from solar or wind power to hydrogen (with respect to Lower Heating Value - LHV)
Design to integrate solar and/or wind resources
Address business cases and applications where the specific off grid approach may have a significant impact
As reported in the MAWP, target KPIs on cost per nominal power for alkaline and PEM electrolysers will be considered"

The aim is to develop strategic partnership in HPC with Brazil and Mexico that enables advancing the work on HPC applications in domains of common interest. Brazilian and Mexican partners will not be funded by the EU and they are expected to participate in the project with their own funding.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Take advantage of the full capabilities of exascale computing, in particular through high-productivity programming environments, system software and management, exascale I/O and storage in the presence of multiple tiers of data storage, supercomputing for extreme data and emerging HPC use modes, mathematics and algorithms for extreme scale HPC systems for existing or visionary applications, including data-intensive and extreme data applications in scientific areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, life sciences, materials, climate, geosciences, etc.
Scope:
Proposals should address one of the following subtopics:
a) High productivity programming environments for exascale: Proposals should have as target to simplify application software development for large- and extreme-scale systems. This can include the development of more productive programming models and environments, the easier combination of different programming models, and using increased intelligence throughout the programming environment. Key aspects include managing data transfers, data locality and memory management, including support for heterogeneous and reconfigurable systems as well as dealing with inter-application dynamic load balancing and malleability, adapting to changes in the number of processors. Unified performance tools are required supporting HPC, embedded and extreme data workloads, on diverse target systems. APIs, runtime systems and the underlying libraries should support auto-tuning for performance and energy optimisation. Automated support for debugging and anomaly detection is also included under this subtopic. To provide simplified development and to ensure the maintainability of domain-specific languages (DSLs), DSL frameworks are required which target a general-purpose stable programming model and runtime. Since large future systems will require the use of multiple programming models or APIs, an important aspect is interoperability and standardisation of programming model, API and runtime as well as the composability of programming models (the capability of building new programming models out of existing programming model elements)
b) Exascale system software and management: Proposals should advance the state of the art in system software and management for node architectures that will be drastically more complex and their resource topology and heterogeneity will require OS and runtime enhancement, such as data aware scheduling. In the area of hardware abstraction, proposals should address run time handling of all types of resources (cores, bandwidth, logical and physical memory or storage) and controls, e.g. for optimised data coherency, consistency and data flow. For applications, proposals should address new multi-criteria resource allocation capabilities and interaction during task execution, with the aim to improve resilience, interactivity, power and efficiency. To cope with the exploding amount of data, the sequential analysis process (capture, store, analyse) is not sufficient; proposals should explore on-the-fly analysis methods offering reactivity, compute efficiency and availability. Graphical simulation interaction will require new real-time features; configuration and deployment tools will have to evolve to take into account the composability of software execution environments.
c) Exascale I/O and storage in the presence of multiple tiers of data storage: proposals should address exascale I/O systems expected to have multiple tiers of data storage technologies, including non-volatile memory. Fine grain data access prioritisation of processes and applications sharing data in these tiers is one of the goals as well as prioritisation applied to file/object creates/deletes. Runtime layers should combine data replication with data layout transformations relevant for HPC, in order to meet the needs for improved performance and resiliency. It is also desirable for the I/O subsystem to adaptively provide optimal performance or reliability especially in the presence of millions of processes simultaneously doing I/O. It is critical that programming system interoperability and standardised APIs are achieved. On the fly data management supporting data processing, taking into account multi-tiered storage and involving real time in situ/in transit processing should be addressed.
d) Supercomputing for Extreme Data and emerging HPC use modes: HPC architectures for real-time and in-situ data analytics are required to support the processing of large-scale and high velocity real-time data (e.g. sensor data, Internet of Things) together with large volumes of stored data (e.g. climate simulations, predictive models, etc.). The approaches should include support for real-time in-memory analysis of different data structures, direct processing of compressed data and appropriate benchmarking method for performance analysis. Interactive 3-D visualisation of large-scale data to allow users to explore large information spaces in 3-D and perform on-demand data analysis in real-time (e.g. large scale queries or analytics) should be addressed. Interactive supercomputing is required to execute complex workflows for urgent decision making in the field of critical clinical diagnostics, natural risks or spread of diseases; this implies adapting operational procedures of HPC infrastructures, developing efficient co-scheduling techniques or improving checkpoint/restart and extreme data management
e) Mathematics and algorithms for extreme scale HPC systems and applications working with extreme data: Specific issues are quantification of uncertainties and noise, multi-scale, multi-physics and extreme data. Mathematical methods, numerical analysis, algorithms and software engineering for extreme parallelism should be addressed. Novel and disruptive algorithmic strategies should be explored to minimize data movement as well as the number of communication and synchronization instances in extreme computing. Parallel-in-time methods may be investigated to boost parallelism of simulation codes across a wide range of application domains. Taking into account data-related uncertainties is essential for the acceptance of numerical simulation in decision making; a unified European VVUQ (Verification Validation and Uncertainty Quantification) package for Exascale computing should be provided by improving methodologies and solving problems limiting usability for very large computations on many-core configurations; access to the VVUQ techniques for the HPC community should be facilitated by providing software that is ready for deployment on supercomputers.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals should clearly indicate the subtopic which is their main focus. At least one project per subtopic will be funded.
Expected Impact:
Contribution to the realisation of the ETP4HPC Strategic Research Agenda, thus strengthened European research and industrial leadership in HPC technologies.
Successful transition to practical exascale computing for the addressed specific element of the HPC stack.
Covering important segments of the broader and/or emerging HPC markets, especially extreme-computing, emerging use modes and extreme-data HPC systems.

Scope:
Proposals with innovative and ground-breaking approaches to system architectures targeting extreme scale, power-efficient and highly resilient platforms with emphasis on balanced compute and data access characteristics. Special attention should be given to extreme data processing requirements. Proposals should have a strong co-design approach driven by a mix of ambitious applications and in close cooperation with the various scientific disciplines and stakeholders concerned. Proposals should show how their proposed solution improves energy efficiency and demonstrate the reduced energy-to-solution for the selected applications. Possible strategies for improving energy efficiency may include: reducing PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness), designing of cost-efficient approaches to the reuse of thermal energy, reducing the amount of energy spent for communication and data movement. Proposals should address the problem of maintaining reliability, coping with run-time errors and enabling stable operation of an HPC system that is able of extreme scaling; this issue may be addressed through holistic detection/recover approaches covering and orchestrating all layers of the HPC stack as well as significant advancements in fault prediction algorithms and smarter tools to prevent faults. Proposals should provide analytical or simulation models that allow to extrapolate the sustained performance on the given architecture for HPC systems. The target system architectures must scale to at least 100 PFlops and, for compute-centric workloads, a target of 15MW for 250 PFlops peak performance in 2019 is suggested.

FET Communication and Outreach: Support communication activities on the FET programme and its achievements and outreach actions targeting a wide range of audiences including the general public, and going well beyond the world of academia and research. This shall stimulate the emergence of a FET community and its connection to relevant multipliers and other stakeholder networks. The activities shall use a diversity of channels and interventions (for example news items, social media, interviews, workshops, exhibitions, competitions, code camps and participatory actions for wider engagement).
b. FET Innovation: Stimulate the impact on innovation from FET-funded research and improving the innovation readiness levels of FET results, for example by providing a kind of “market place” for FET technologies, by connecting the world of research with that of, potential users, technology leaders, technology transfer organisations, entrepreneurs, investors or alternative financing channels.
c. FET Observatory: Ongoing and systematic identification of new and emerging technologies from FET portfolio analysis, trends analysis (using for instance bibliometric tools, media watch, consultations and workshops) and broader horizon scanning (beyond research), including also consideration of ethical implications, gender differences and long-term impacts on society and humankind.
Specificity to the nature of FET is a must (e.g., upstream positioning, interdisciplinarity, high-risk, novelty, long-term impact,...).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 0.5 million (and up to 0.7 million for a.) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Strengthening globally recognised European leadership in the early exploration of visionary, new and emerging technologies and with a strong engagement of scientists, citizens, innovators and policy makers.
Improved long-term innovation potential in Europe both from the abundance of novel ideas and the range of actors ready to take them forward.
Improved readiness across Europe to engage in inter-disciplinary research collaboration and to take up new, open and responsible research and innovation practices, with due attention to aspects such as education, gender differences and long-term societal, ethical and legal implications.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to the Research Executive Agency (REA) and will be implemented by the Commission services.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU evidence-based food safety framework is based on the General Food Law, which, among others, introduced the risk analysis principle to underpin food safety policy making and established the European Food Safety Authority. Recent consumer concerns on the transparency of the process of safety assessment of our foods as well as technological developments and innovations have shown that there is a need to reflect on the EU food safety system of the future. The challenge requires fostering coordination and integration among different food safety stakeholders in order to ensure that the science and infrastructures needed to support evidence-based policies of the future will be timely available.
Scope:
Proposals shall aim at developing a research and innovation platform for collaboration and coordination across food safety stakeholders in Europe. Actions shall engage key stakeholders such as National Food Safety Authorities, relevant EU Agencies, Commission Services, policy makers, scientists and civil society with the objectives to: i) map the state of play in food safety research and innovation in the different Member States and Associated Countries; ii) strengthen research and innovation capacity to ensure that Europe continues to be the global leader on food safety standards; iii) exchange of knowledge and data across the scientific community and policy actors including relevant EU Agencies; iv) improve coherence and reduce the overlap between national and EU funding in Food safety research. v) develop innovative approaches to communicate both on food safety research and innovation as well as on risk assessment procedures in the area of food safety in a manner that citizens are properly informed and engaged in taking into account gender aspects, thus contributing to boosting consumers' confidence on the evidence-base for food safety systems and vi) explore avenues for long-term science- policy-society interfaces.
In agreement with the Commission services, proposals should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In line with principles, requirements and procedures of the General Food Law, in the short/medium term proposals will:
Deliver a platform for European cooperation at multi-partner level on food safety that builds on research and innovation (R&I) and policy coherence, exploits synergies and capabilities between countries and regions and enhances public confidence.
Develop innovative models for collaborations and knowledge exchange across food safety actors and develop networks to promote coherence and harmonisation across the food safety stakeholders throughout the Member States.
Identify integrated and reliable resources (e.g. data repositories, accredited laboratories, individual roadmaps, inventories) accessible for the food safety stakeholders.
Deliver the basis for the development of joint trans-national research programmes and alignment of national research agendas.
Develop a coherent Food Safety Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) which shall also address consumers' expectations, emerging technologies and policy priorities.
Deliver models to inform civil society of the science-based risk assessment process providing clear guidance on dissemination models.
Deliver logistic and technical support for permanent structure in the future ensuring that research and innovation will support food safety policies.

","Research and Innovation action
","15 October 2019
","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Global biodiversity remains a largely untapped source of natural bioactive molecules and compounds. Such molecules offer unmatched chemical diversity and structural complexity, together with biological potency and selectivity. While some of the natural chemodiversity has been studied, resulting in open access and proprietary compound libraries, the potential for developing commercial products is far from exhausted. There is still significant potential for application in various industries, such as high-value agro-chemicals (e.g. natural plant protection products), food and feed ingredients (such as nutraceuticals), pharmaceutically active ingredients, cosmetics, flavourings etc. On conservative estimates, these compounds represent a global market of EUR 150 billion[1] and global industrial revenues of EUR 19 billion[2].
The main challenges tackled in the topic are, depending on the source:
technological readiness for the sustainable exploitation of natural resources, linked with;
scarcity of the source natural biological material (e.g. in case of protected / rare species);
low concentrations of the target compounds, leading to the difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts of the pure molecules.
The challenge is to match their sustainable sourcing and processing with efficient and cost-effective use. This calls for close cooperation between industrial and academic partners, with due consideration for health and environmental legislation, and informed public engagement.
Scope:
Proposals should cover the entire development pipeline with a focus on:
biodiscovery (prospecting natural biological resources from land and sea), i.e.:
identifying suitable molecules;
verifying their claimed benefits;
optimising technological exploitation, including cultivation strategies for selected production systems and metabolic engineering to ensure high productivity and purity;
assessing safety, and
developing products (final formulation) and their commercialisation, in Europe.
Proposals should focus on small molecules[3], with novel bioactivities, qualities and applications, in particular from unusual or underutilised sources, and on our understanding of their relevant chemical, genetic, physiological and environmental make-up. Special attention should be devoted to ensuring sustainable sourcing from the raw feedstock, to avoid overexploitation, taking into account recent technical advances in molecular biology (e.g. metabolomics, new gene mining and optimisation techniques, development of suitable host production platforms). Proposals could explore in vivo or in vitro approaches to study the interactions between various biological entities (e.g. through symbiotic or defence relationships) as a source of interesting bioactive properties. They should:
prove the techno-economic feasibility and effectiveness of a chosen production route[4];
commit to assessing, as part of the project, the environmental and health impacts of the developed products or processes, using life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies based on available standards, certification, and accepted and validated approaches, and
guarantee biodiversity preservation and comply with relevant international rules on access to biological resources, their sustainable use and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from their utilisation, with the national regulations in the source countries and with the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol.
In line with the EU’s policy on responsible research and innovation, dissemination and public engagement via modern communication and dissemination tools will be an essential element of the projects that are funded. Projects should involve an analysis of the state of the art to avoid duplications and overlaps with past or ongoing research. Cooperation with other selected proposals under this topic is encouraged.
Proposals should address one of the following sub-topics:
A: Prospecting terrestrial natural biological resources for biologically active compounds
Actions must focus on land-based biological natural resources.
B: Prospecting aquatic natural biological resources for biologically active compounds
Actions must focus on marine and fresh-water biological natural resources.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of around EUR 7.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will support the sustainable biodiscovery and use of natural biological resources from diverse environments and ecosystems, allowing better assessment of the selected bioactivity potential. This will increase capacity in the European biotechnology sector and other industries to respond to society’s needs. Specifically, activities will contribute to:
Short/medium term:
developing novel natural, sustainable and ‘eco-friendly’ products with significant bioactive properties, especially as relevant for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, agrochemical or marine sectors and applications. These will deliver clear-cut benefits for consumers by being more effective and/or eco-friendly, cheaper, and more readily accessible than existing alternatives;
developing sustainable exploitation, cultivation and processing methods based on promising species/organisms, and chosen production routes;
increasing public-private cooperation in European biotechnology, while integrating its sectors e.g. ‘green’ (plant), ‘blue’ (marine), and ‘white’ (industrial); and;
increasing public knowledge of biodiversity potential and, if relevant, ecosystem interactions, and their impact on bioactive response;
Long term:
reducing the pressure on the harvesting of wild populations; and;
ensuring the environmental and economic sustainability of the entire process, inter alia by reducing and extracting waste via the efficient use of biomass (cascade approach).

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
It has been demonstrated that the unique selectivity and catalytic activity of enzymes gives them significant potential to support sustainability, reduce environmental pollution, lower processing costs and enhance product performance and functionalities. Growing environmental concerns have contributed to the rapid growth in the market for enzymes and their use in various industrial and speciality applications. Enzymes find application in the processing phase and in the formulation of consumer products such as washing agents, textiles, personal care, cosmetics or nutraceuticals.
The specific challenge is to expand the use of enzymes to respond to the steadily growing demand for greener consumer products, combining economic competitiveness and greater sustainability.
Scope:
Proposals should address the development of novel or improved enzyme(s) for the processing and/or the formulation of one or more of the following consumer products: washing agents, textiles, personal care products, cosmetics and nutraceuticals. The approach could involve bioprospecting or the exploitation of existing databases. Activities should include assessment of the environmental impact of the developed approach. They should aim at a strong improvement of environmental performance, against the state of the art, linked to enzyme functionality. In line with the principles of Responsible Research and Innovation, close research collaboration with all relevant stakeholders is needed to ensure future industrial implementation and market uptake.
Proposals should:
involve the development of an efficient production system of the enzyme(s) in question, together with downstream processes and methods for enzyme formulation and inclusion in the consumer product(s);
(where they concern the development of enzyme-containing consumer products) cover the management of safety aspects, including appropriate risk assessment;
combine the development of the targeted enzyme(s) with the development of generic platform technologies with a view to faster transition from lab to market. This should be based on an interdisciplinary approach and could involve: novel technologies and methods such as the screening, design, creation or optimisation of novel high-performance enzymes as well as computational methods and tools for effective big-data analysis.
Cooperation with other selected proposals under this topic is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of around EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Microorganisms are used in the bio-based industry to produce a wide range of products. To date, most bulk and speciality bio-based products from biorefineries are based on microbial monocultures. Monocultures are optimised for simple processes, so their efficiency is limited in complex situations, e.g. in integrated biorefineries generating several added-value chemicals and ideally using a wide variety of feedstock. In nature, microorganisms do not live and function in isolation: they form complex communities associated with specific habitats (microbiomes). Compared with monocultures, microbial communities possess many appealing and powerful features such as stability, functional robustness and the ability to perform complex tasks. These have inspired rapidly growing interest in industrial microbiomes.
The challenge is to use industrial microbiome approaches to optimise existing industrial processes and/or to develop wholly new microbiome-based industrial processes.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on concrete bio-based processes and/or products. They should embrace an understanding of natural consortia mechanisms and their transposition to industrial environments, and involve the engineering of synthetic microbial consortia inspired by the metabolic interaction found in nature. Proposals should employ the use of -omics tools to understand, monitor and exploit microbial communities in the industrial environment. Activities should focus on the optimisation of existing industrial processes or on the design and development of wholly new ones, in order to improve process and product quality and safety.
Activities should optimise the use of pre-existing databases and research infrastructures (including distributed and virtual ones) and the opportunities offered by big-data management tools, thus ensuring interoperability, standard methods and enhanced networking. Multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral experts should cooperate, share standards across borders and disciplines and integrate resources. The interdisciplinary, cross-sectorial approach should also apply to training activities to improve professional skills and competencies, and support job creation in the bio-based and bioeconomy sectors. Cooperation with other selected proposals under this topic is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of around EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of the renewed 2018 EU Bioeconomy Strategy, proposals are expected to:
raise awareness of microbiomes’ potential to transform and future-proof the bio-based economy;
improve overall knowledge of the industrial microbiome with a view to responding to market needs;
improve the bio-based sector’s overall sustainability (including climate change mitigation) and innovation capacity by using microbiome applications and knowledge;
strengthen the market position and increase the market share of bio-based solutions;
deliver results in a form that allows for efficient feedback into policymaking in research, innovation and technology;

","Coordination and support action
","15 October 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The UN sustainable development goals are at the top of the international science, technology and innovation (STI) policy agenda. Among the key objectives of policies to improve sustainability is the development of renewable, innovative bioproducts beyond biofuels and traditional products[1] that:
have a small (low-carbon) environmental footprint;
contribute to more circularity and resource efficiency; and
support the shift from non-renewable fossil resources, while taking account of the international context[2].
The challenge involves comprehensive analysis of:
diverse sustainability-related aspects of bio-based industrial products[3];
local vs. global value chains, and their carbon and environmental footprint;
global value chain traceability; and
use of specific certification and labelling schemes.
Better understanding in this regard could lead to more sustainable value chains, greater trust and acceptance by consumers and end-users, and awareness among decision-makers. In the long term, better understanding of sustainability standards can lead to a closer alignment of growth and circularity and ultimately increase the market share of the resulting novel bio-based products.
Scope:
Building on the state of the art, including past and ongoing EU-funded projects, this action will bring together global sustainability experts in bio-based innovation (focus on bio-based products) to strengthen the common understanding of sustainability goals and green innovation, and to provide reliable and easy-to-use data for policymakers, consumers and end-users. Cooperation with key European and non-European bioeconomy leaders and international organisations, and the bio-based industry is strongly encouraged.
The action will:
address the main issues concerning the sustainable bioeconomy and its practical implementation in global value-chains;
promote the sharing of best practice as regards corporate responsibility; and
deliver specific recommendations taking account of existing standards and the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, enriched by specific challenges and the potential of renewable, innovative and safe bioproducts [4]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of the renewed 2018 European bioeconomy strategy[5] related to voluntary guidance on bio-based innovations, proposals are expected to:
Short/medium term:
contribute to the global discussion on efficient, implementable and fit-for-purpose sustainability schemes, criteria and indicators;
feed into ongoing international efforts in this regard (e.g. OECD);
support dialogue between regulators and the bio-based industry;
improve understanding of the international dimension of the guidance and identification of bottlenecks, enablers and gaps that influence synergies and the deployment of bio-based innovations;
strengthen corporate responsibility and awareness as regards bio-based innovations, circularity and sustainability, building trust between stakeholders;
widen the use of bio-based standards and certification schemes and increase the role of bio-based products in sustainability schemes, e.g. (eco)labelling; and
Long term:
support the creation of a market pull for European and global bio-based products.

","Research and Innovation action
","15 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Manufacturing has been using for the production of goods and wares many different processes that can be classified as subtractive or additive processes. Traditional machines have been normally focused on only a single type of these processes but there is a new generation of machines that combines the features of individual manufacturing processes into a single platform.
These hybrid manufacturing processes can enable a high-value and sustainable manufacturing by keeping the advantages of the single processes in a single machine whilst reducing their disadvantages. Nevertheless, the enhanced features of the hybrid machines bring as well an increasing process complexity and higher costs of production that impact the final price in the market of the produced items. High added value products with complex structures can balance out those production costs.
New hybrid machines, equipped with both subtractive and additive manufacturing technologies, can be a game changer to create new opportunities and applications for Additive Manufacturing (AM). The great potential of AM is in most of the cases limited by the subtractive post-processing steps needed to ensure optimal tolerances and surface finish. These hybrid combinations can also enable the production of larger items than in AM single machines and have a large potential for repair applications.
Scope:
Proposals should address the development of advanced All-in-one machines that enable the production of a part/product directly from a CAD model in a short time and without the need of post-processing steps. A variety of Additive Manufacturing technologies and different materials can address this challenge by means of new and/or innovative processes.
Develop new machine concepts and designs into a single set-up processing and process control.
Full integration and automation of the subtractive and additive processes in the machine
Increased build rate of the machine in comparison to the separate processes
Production of parts/products that are functional and with the final desired accuracy, surface-finish and tolerances and material efficiency
Properties of the new components after the manufacturing process
The proposal must include at least one demonstrator in real industrial settings in order to show the industrial viability of the solution.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.
The involvement of SMEs is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The developed novel hybrid approaches should lead to a remarkable impact in the following terms:
20% reduction in time and cost, with respect to the current additive and subtractive processes.
15% increase in productivity for high-volume AM production, with respect to the current additive and subtractive processes.
More flexibility and robustness of the machines to adapt with customisation and changing market needs
Reduction of inventory because of the making of products on-demand
Reduction of work floor space
Create localised manufacturing environments and reduce supply chains length
Contributions to standardisation and certification for new hybrid procedures.
The role of SMEs and their potential as manufacturers and end-users for the developed machines needs to be considered, in order to ensure the access to existing and new markets.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

","01 September 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge:      Innovation is fostered when new ideas can emerge and easily translate into socio-economic value. Working together, partners with complementary backgrounds, knowledge and skills, and in new and established value-chains, can turn these ideas into sustainable innovative products, processes and services that both address societal challenges and/or are highly competitive in global markets. FTI aims to accelerate this commercialisation process by providing extended funding opportunities through an open and agile scheme nurturing bottom-up ideas from innovative constituencies across Europe.
Scope:             The FTI pilot supports projects undertaking innovation from the demonstration stage through to market uptake, including stages such as piloting, test-beds, systems validation in real world/working conditions, validation of business models, pre-normative research, and standard-setting. It targets relatively mature new technologies, concepts, processes and business models that need a last development step to reach the market and achieve wider deployment. To this end, if a proposal involves technological innovation, the consortium must declare that the technology or the technologies concerned are at least at Technology Readiness Level (TRL)[1] 6. Projects can be interdisciplinary.
Proposals must relate to any field under the specific objective ""Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies"" and/or to any of the specific objectives under the priority ""Societal challenges""[2].
Proposals should specify the intended outcome of the project and describe its key performance indicators/success criteria.
Proposals must also include a business plan clearly describing the market potential (potential users/customers and benefits for them; targeted European/global markets, etc.), the business opportunities for participants, measures to enhance the probability of eventual commercial take-up. and a credible commercialisation strategy that identifies next steps and specifies other actors to be involved. Particular attention should be paid to IP protection and ownership and to the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
The expected impact should be clearly described in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Factors such as time sensitivity and the international competitive situation should be considered in the light of the technology/innovation fields and industry sectors concerned. Possible impacts on sustainability or climate change, in particular, or on other cross-cutting objectives of Horizon 2020[3], should also be highlighted.
Consortia must involve participants from industry. Universities, research and technology organisations and further innovation actors may also participate. Actors that can play a key role in the commercialisation process are encouraged to take part, such as cluster organisations, end-users, industrial associations, incubators, investors, or the public sector. First-time industry applicants[4] and SMEs are particularly welcome.
Expected impact:
Fast development, commercial take-up and/or wide deployment of sustainable innovative solutions (products, processes, services, business models etc.) in enabling and industrial technologies and/or for tackling societal challenges.
Time to initial market take-up no later than 3 years after the beginning of the FTI project. In very well-justified cases linked to the specific characteristics of a particular innovation field or industry sector, the time to initial market take-up could be longer.
Enhanced competitiveness and growth of business partners in the consortium, measured in terms of turnover and job creation.
Increased industry participation, including SMEs, and more industry first-time applicants to Horizon 2020.
Leveraging more private investment into research and/or innovation.
Where appropriate, addressing transnational value-chains and/or EU-wide or global markets.

Specific challenge:
Today's manufacturing is increasingly challenged by uncertainties of continuously and rapidly -changing market conditions and increasingly shorter time-to-market requirements. Manufacturing value chains are distributed and dependent on complex information and material flow requiring new approaches inside and outside the factory both on process and product lifecycle level. They have to respond faster and more efficiently to higher complexity and frequently changing designs. Actions must include validation/demonstration elements and involve stakeholders covering the whole value chain.
Scope:a. R&I Actions:proposals are expected to cover at least one of the three themes identified below.CPS-based process optimisation (Cyber-Physical Systems) for adaptive and smart manufacturing systems bringing together novel concepts for CPS, progress in advanced control and new modelling and simulation technologies. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.- Methods for integrative control and robust optimization of discrete and continuous processes supporting engineers in their aim of detecting, measuring and monitoring the variables, events and situations which affect the performance, energy-use and reliability of manufacturing systems. Research should encompass progress in smart sensor technologies, smart system design, embedded systems, cognitive technologies and advanced control. - Scalable CPS architectures for adaptive and smart manufacturing systems to dynamically enable the continuous design, configuration, monitoring and maintenance of operational capability, quality, and efficiency. Self-learning closing the feedback loop between production and design should be included as appropriate.  Collaborative and mobile manufacturing: Development of agile collaboration tools for process optimisation of manufacturing assets across the supply chain towards the Cloud-enabled Manufacturing Business Web. Research should address scalable real-time architectures to master complexity and data security of the supply network and underlying logistics resources. In an integrated approach focusing on end-to-end integration of the entire manufacturing processes and the supply networks, research issues to be addressed include: IoT-based continuous data collection from real-world resources, resource virtualisation, real-time, modular architectures for interoperability of intra plant and extra plant processes in conjunction with mobile, collaborative tools for data sharing, data analytics and knowledge-based systems, at factory and at supply network level. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Towards zero-failure laser-based manufacturing: Fast and accurate process monitoring systems allowing feedback control of laser process parameters in highly dynamic manufacturing processes. Actions should cover in particular the development of (in-line) process monitoring sensors, measurement and non-destructive testing tools including the related high speed data processing and reduction. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:In current market and technological context, mechanical products have to be designed and produced taking into account structural optimisation (which often involves complex structures and geometries) and economically efficient production (i.e. productive and flexible manufacturing).  Automated manufacturing of complex geometries, such as additive manufacturing, can be related to issues such as 3D structured, multi-layered and hybrid materials, joining issues or the joint-free realisation of complex shapes. Moreover, newer constraints are coming from requirements of sustainability in production processes (resource and energy efficiency), both through additional regulations and through the increased materials and energy costs. The main aims in the manufacturing of complex structures are quality and productivity with minimum use of material and energy.
Scope: Three complementary approaches can be considered: Innovative resource-efficient manufacturing processes (through tolerance to recycling within manufacturing processes and remanufacturing or through first time right approaches); innovative energy efficient machinery; and developments in process control allowing both to cope with more recycling in the process and to increase output quality (i.e. reduce out-of-tolerance products that have to be refused).
Research activities should address several of the following areas:
-          Manufacturing process control and monitoring strategies based on integrated models of both processes and machines, with modules for resource and energy efficiency planning and monitoring, and with capability of selection of the best process and machine for the part to be manufactured.
-          Innovative process concepts and tools, including design supported by computational modelling, for resource efficiency in complex geometries manufacturing.
-          Innovative machinery improving resource efficiency from the current state of the art in complex geometries manufacturing.
-          Remanufacturing and recycling, with novel or improved use of waste streams.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 4-6.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
The impact on the areas of application of the projects is expected to be:
                Reduction of at least 30% in the material usage pertaining to the manufacturing of complex structures and geometries when compared to current average values.
                Reduction of at least 20% in the overall energy consumption related to the manufacturing of complex structures and geometries when compared to current average values.
                Elimination of faulty manufactured parts by the adequate combination of integrated process-machine approaches with a continuous control of process parameters.

For Europe's competitiveness in manufacturing, it is crucial that advances in ICT are taken up in engineering and manufacturing ""at large"" as soon as they have the appropriate maturity level. The topic will support fast adoption, and wide spread technology transfer of advanced ICT-based solutions for manufacturing across the business process chains – from ""cradle to grave"".
Scope:
As Phase 3 of I4MS (www.i4ms.eu) this topic addresses the adoption of the next generation of ICT advances in the manufacturing domain. Focus is on emerging innovative technologies and processes, which need to be customised, integrated, tested and validated before being released on the market. Special emphasis is on strengthening European SMEs and mid-caps along the value chain by adopting new concepts linked to innovative business and/or service models, and bringing them into contact with actors that can provide access to finance and access to advanced training to reskill workers.
a. Innovation actions must address all of the following three aspects.
Establishing across Europe networks of multidisciplinary competence centres offering “marketplaces” for companies that want to experiment with digital technologies in manufacturing of discrete or continuous goods. Centres should have the capacity to offer access to technology platforms and skills for developing and testing innovative technologies and applications, including access to design and manufacturing, rapid prototyping and equipment assessment initiatives. They should also act as brokers between suppliers and users of the technology products. Competence centres are encouraged to link to existing/emerging regional (smart specialisation) or national innovation hubs. If Horizon 2020 funding is complemented by ESIF or other regional or national funds: Horizon 2020 funding shall be used for carrying out highly innovative experiments that will multiply the impact of local initiatives to a European scale, and will build partnerships between businesses in Europe.
Carrying out a critical mass of cross-border experiments bringing together different key actors along the full value chain to customise the technologies according to the requirements of the users. Driven by the requirements of first-time users, Application Experiments bring together the actors of the value chain and the experts necessary to enable new users to develop novel products or services and assist them in customising and applying these in their respective environments. Experiment descriptions in proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation plan and business scenario, which will be developed further in the proposed experiment. To remain flexible on which experiments will be carried out, the action may involve financial support to third parties, in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers running the experiments for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 20 000 – 100 000[1] per party). Maximum 50% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose[2].
Activities to achieve long-term sustainability of the competence centres and the eco-system. This includes the development of a business plan for the competence centres and the marketplace, of which an outline business case and industrial exploitation strategy should be described in the proposal, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme. In addition, investors should be attracted to support business development of SMEs and mid-cap actors in successful experiments. Training needs of the SMEs and mid-caps should be collected and shared with training providers in the eco-system, with the ultimate aim that sufficient training opportunities will be available for all companies.Such activities would include also dissemination.
Proposers should cover at least one of the following four areas of technologies for adoption in manufacturing. Proposers are encouraged to support the building of pan-European ecosystems of emerging platforms and are expected to collaborate on reinforcing the European I4MS ecosystem, and to establish links to related activities, e.g. in the IoT Focus Area, the Joint Undertaking ECSEL, and the SPARC or big data PPPs.
CPS and IoT: Adoption and piloting of CPS/IoT in smart production environments, with special focus on scalable, modular and re-configurable automation systems across the process chain especially for SMEs.
Robotics[3]: New robot systems that are cost effective at lower lot sizes, with the benefit of long-term improvements in productivity, the ability to work safely in close physical collaboration with human operators; and that are intuitive to use and adaptive to changes in task configuration. Key for fast adoption is the availability of flexible and easy to apply material feeding solutions. Step changes to at least two of the following abilities are therefore considered necessary: configurability, interaction capability, decisional autonomy in terms of context-awareness, and dependability.
Modelling, simulation and analytics: HPC Cloud-based modelling, simulation and analytics services with special emphasis on sustained service models; on providing real-time support; and on addressing comprehensively security and privacy issues at all levels.
Digital design for additive Manufacturing: Supporting the broad uptake of innovative additive manufacturing equipment and processes particularly focusing on the link between design tools and production, changes in business models, process chains and stakeholder relations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 8 million would allow the areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one innovation action is supported for each area of technologies.
b. Coordination and Support actions
To advance the European I4MS innovation ecosystem the network is to be reinforced. The aim is to achieve broad coverage in technological, application, innovation, and geographic terms, and to link up with regional/national innovation initiatives, including access to finance and access to training. Its tasks and services shall include maintaining a single innovation portal for newcomers, including a catalogue of the competences available in the I4MS network; sharing of best practices and experiences from I4MS and relevant regional/national initiatives; dissemination; identifying new innovative ICT technologies that can benefit from this scheme, brokering between users and suppliers; leveraging further investment for SMEs and mid-caps to bring the results of the application experiments to real use in the company, providing support in finding training providers for reskilling the workers in the SMEs and midcaps. For these support actions, close cooperation with the European Factories of the Future Association (EFFRA[4]), the newly established Knowledge Innovation Community (KIC) on Added Value Manufacturing and the CSA funded under the Smart Anything Everywhere initiative is required.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address all of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success when appropriate:
Exploration of new application areas for advanced ICT in manufacturing at large: Attract a significant number of new users of advanced ICT in the manufacturing sector, in particular SMEs and the mid-caps.
More innovative and competitive technology suppliers, in particular SMEs, both on the level of ICT and on the level of manufacturing equipment, able to supply manufacturers with new equipment, components, and tools for improved manufacturing and engineering operations.
More competitive European service providers through provisioning of new types of services; through strengthening the presence on local markets.
Creation of a self-sustainable ecosystem of competence centers, users and suppliers supported by services available through a marketplace, covering a large number of regions and their smart specialisation.
A critical mass of pan European experiments that demonstrate innovative, sustainable business models covering the whole value chain leading to quantifiable increases in market shares and/or productivity of European companies and/or industrial capacities in Europe.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Laser-based manufacturing has become very competitive and is one of the back-bones of modern production technologies. Highly accurate mass production is available for a wide range of products in a wide range of industries. Whilst laser processing is highly flexible, the change from one production lot to the next usually requires operator intervention, reconfigurations and costly down times to adjust current processing tools to the new task. The trend to individualisation requires a high degree of digitization as well as tools and systems which are highly autonomous and automated to reduce production time and costs.
Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a number of advantages over conventional manufacturing including the unprecedented freedom of design for example in terms of geometry, material composition and intrinsic properties of the work piece. Whilst laser-based AM is used for prototyping and has begun to penetrate some smaller markets, it is not yet competitive on a larger scale especially with respect to production speed and costs. In order to increase the productivity of laser-based AM and to bring it a significant step further towards industrial manufacturing a better mastering of all stages of the process chain and their interaction is necessary.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions
From ""design to piece"" – Excellence in laser-based additive industrial manufacturing[1]: From Design to the final work piece, the topic addresses laser-based additive industrial manufacturing of metallic materials. All process chain steps may be addressed, for example CAD, modelling of the additive process, the additive process itself including the use of several materials in a single work piece, process control and quality assurance, the combination of additive and subtractive processes, surface finish and precision, etc. Materials for AM and their quality control are considered as a step. Proposals must cover at least two important steps in the process chain and the relevant links between them. The goal is to significantly improve the overall performance in terms of speed and costs whilst producing high quality work pieces. Standardisation aspects should also be addressed as appropriate. Proposals should be driven by concrete business cases and include the relevant partners of the value chain and proposals should contain an outline business case and industrial exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Innovation Actions
Rapid individualised laser-based production: Develop and set-up efficient, highly flexible high throughput pilot facilities on the basis of existing processes for laser-based production and to validate them in real settings. This will require advances in a number of aspects, including intelligent networking and machine cooperation, data handling, modelling, work piece handling, beam delivery, integration of different processes, monitoring, process control etc. Actions must be industry driven and include the key stakeholders running the pilot facility. Proposals should contain an outline business case and industrial exploitation strategy.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should describe how the proposed work will contribute to the following impact criteria and provide metrics, the baseline and targets to measure impact.
a. Research & Innovation Actions
Reinforced industrial leadership in laser-based Additive Manufacturing.
Substantially improved production speed, improved productivity and substantially reduced costs of laser-based Additive Manufacturing.
b. Innovation Actions
More efficient, more flexible and higher throughput of individualised laser-based production.

Specific challenge:Manufacturing intelligence requires a high integration of (ICT-based) engineering tools and secure middleware solutions that facilitate easy, ubiquitous (e.g. Cloud-enabled) and fast sharing of product and process information/knowledge across the entire lifecycle and among all actors involved. Today's ever faster product lifecycles and ever higher quality requirements necessitate manufacturing engineering capability and knowledge that is able to exploit to the maximum the concurrency of product and service engineering with immediate, cross-disciplinary feedback loops to relevant shop floor knowledge. Also end-users feedback and requirements should be taken into account.
Scope: Research should aim at developing open, multi-disciplinary and holistic product-service engineering environments with the following features:
-          Collaborative management of engineering knowledge and its multi-directional exchange between product design, service design and manufacturing, enabled by rapid search for design functionality and reusability.
-          Tools and methodologies to effectively involve customers, suppliers and other relevant organisations across the value chain.
-          Multi-disciplinary search, simulation and optimisation (e.g. including modularity and reusability as optimisation parameters) of designs and innovative visualisation tools involving intuitive tools.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:The consumption of energy and other resources often represents a major part of the cost of manufactured products. Energy and other resources savings need to be considered at several levels: machine, process, the whole factory and along the entire value chain. The development of new business models focusing on the collaboration of companies operating in the same value chain to increase resources and energy efficiency can bring important cost savings in products and increased competitiveness. Inter-company cooperation can be further facilitated by geographic proximity (Industrial Symbiosis). The ultimate objective is to increase competitiveness of the EU manufacturing sector while at the same time improving environmental performance.
Scope: Research activities should be multi-disciplinary and address all of the following areas:
-          Energy and resource consumption data collection along the entire value chain, modelling and integration of data into the decision making tools and procedures.
-          Development and implementation of new business models aimed at reducing energy and resource consumption along the whole or a relevant part of the value chain including final users when possible and recycling or reprocessing companies.
-          Clustering of factories, suppliers or any other company in order to implement common resources optimization or intelligent demand side management strategies. That may require the development of adapted Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES).
-          Development of strategies for enabling energy characterisation of enterprises as a means for obtaining energy certifications coherent with the European Eco-design provisions.
-          Development of coherent detailed business cases, including economic, strategic and commercial analysis, of the business models developed during the project.
Projects are expected to use appropriate Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Cost techniques with rigorous baseline values in order to estimate the impact of the results of the project.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 4-6.
This topic is particularly suitable for collaboration at international level, particularly under the IMS scheme.[1] Project partnerships that include independent organisations from IMS regions[2] are therefore encouraged. For a project to get the IMS label it must include independent organisations from at least two different IMS regions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
The impact on the areas of application of the projects is expected to be:
                Energy consumption and CO2 emission reduction (LCA) for the final product of at least 20% from cradle to gate (use and disposal omitted).
                Energy consumption and CO2 emission reduction for the product of at least 30% from cradle to grave.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:Immersive and symbiotic collaboration between human workers and robots is a key element to be addressed for the further automation of tasks and processes in the European manufacturing industry. It offers a solution leading to higher profitability to robot-reluctant industries where current tasks and processes are too complex to be automated. Currently novel methods for human-robot interaction have been proven in structured non-industrial environments. In order to enhance the introduction of robots on the shop floor in a real industrial setting, several important human and organisational issues, such as safety and difficult working environments, have to be dealt with.
In particular, future human-robot-systems will have to be dynamic and cost-effective, act safely in a shared fenceless working space and allow for the development of specific competences and skills for workers in their interactions with robots.
Scope: While the focus will be on demonstrating the multimodal manufacturing systems (e.g. systems combining visual, auditory and haptic interfaces), R&D activities supporting integration and scale-up are also expected.
Two key obstacles to overcome to facilitate the introduction of robots on the shop floor of robot resistant production plants are the safety of the worker and the symbiotic collaboration.
Demonstration activities should focus on at least two topics of each of the two areas:
-                      Safety of the worker:
                     Innovative strategies for online safety monitoring such as the interactive perception of the whole workspace as well as directed perception focused on the task.
                     Development of intrinsically safe robot hardware on industrial scale leading to high power robots which are both safe and precise.
                     Safety during a mechanical failure of the robotic system during tight collaboration of humans and robots.
-                      Human-Robot interaction:
                     Intuitive and multimodal programming to allow robot systems to be rapidly and easily programmed without prior knowledge on robot systems, while still allowing for a cost-efficient deployment of the robotic system in an industrial setting.
                     New methodologies for the initial planning and online dynamic replanning of the shared tasks, taking into account the organisation contexts of the addressed industrial sectors.
                     New innovative, fast and cost-effective sensors for detection in combination with the application of innovative strategies to analyse real-time large amounts of sensor data.
In close interaction with the research activities, relevant certification issues should be addressed. In order to allow a wide use of the newly developed robotic system in new production areas and sectors, a clear case for maintaining reduced investment costs has to be made, including a return-on-investment study.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1].  The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capabilities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
The impact on the areas of application of the projects is expected to be:
                Industrial-scale demonstrator of safe human-robot tight collaboration by sharing workspace and tasks, paving the way for potential improvements of the normative aspects.
                Increasing use of robot installation in traditional European robot-reluctant industries. In particular SMEs, manufacturing plants with highly manual processes and continuous production lines. Further improvement in robotics solutions deployment will contribute to higher employment as more manufacturing capacity will remain in Europe.
                Increasing industrial-readiness and adaptability of human-robot collaborating manufacturing systems by increasing the robustness of those systems for noisy and extreme industrial environments and by combining the flexibility inherent to humans with the enhanced potential of cooperative production systems.
                Improved cost-efficiency through the use of symbiotic human-robot approaches.

Promotion activities should take a more active role in generating new ideas ready to spin-off and/or to go into market introduction, in providing crucial seed financing and in increasing the visibility of the EGNSS.
Scope:
The proposals should aim at capacity building, increasing awareness of EGNSS solutions, providing networking opportunities of centres of excellence and other relevant actors and achieving a critical mass of EGNSS applications success stories, making it an attractive option for private investors in Europe and also globally. Activities under this topic may also contribute to the cooperation schemes, which have been established with partner countries worldwide.
Technology promotion activities can include incentive schemes in the form of financial support to third parties for innovative applications developed by companies and entrepreneurs and based on the EGNSS that will promote the uptake of satellite navigation downstream applications across Europe and beyond.
Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The main aim of this topic is to support building of industrial relationships by gathering private and public institutions around services offered by EGNSS and related applications. This topic should support the competitiveness of EU industry by identifying strategic partners and by developing market opportunities.
The support to incentive schemes should foster the emergence of new downstream applications based on either Galileo and/or EGNOS and therefore to support the EU GNSS industry.

This action focuses on supporting ethics and research integrity activities in the Members States and at the European level. It aims to identify and share good practices and raise the awareness of ethics and research integrity among the research community, taking into account the diversity of stakeholders.
Scope:
Various activities should be undertaken, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, and enhanced cross-border brokerage events. Priority is given to the development of training courses/material designed for the whole research community and interested social actors linked to ethics and research integrity.
In particular, the training courses/material should be used to enhance the knowledge of experts involved in the evaluation of research proposals. The training should mainly focus on existing European legislation (i.e. Charter of human rights, data protection legislation, dual use export regulation etc.). Special attention should also be given to enhance the competence of ethics and research integrity officers in all Member States and associated countries.
The participants are expected to create an e-community/database (using the EU commission tool SINAPSE hosted on the EU data centre) of European and whenever relevant international experts in the different fields of research ethics and integrity. This web platform should be dynamically managed by the members of the network. It should notably ensure the certification of the knowledge level of the experts and enable the progressive enrichment of this expert database. The main objective is to generate mutual benefit and optimal access to the best expertise by Member States, associated countries, European Institutions and other interested countries.
The action must develop measurable indicators for the effectiveness of the proposed activities, in particular the training and certification aspects.
Research Ethics committees and supporting structures, Research Integrity Offices –or the closest equivalent according to national law - from EU Member States, associated countries, neighbourhood policy countries, are encouraged to participate.
Expected Impact:
Strengthen the EU capacity to uphold the highest ethical standards, promote research integrity and minimise misconduct, notably via the exchange and the improvement of existing practices, the development of related training and the optimisation of the available knowledge stock and expertise.
In addition it is expected that while respecting the specific nature of research ethics and research integrity the European network established will reinforce the synergies between these two areas."

Specific challenge: Although Galileo is a European programme, it has a strong international dimension. International cooperation in the field of Galileo-enabled applications is therefore an essential element facilitating its breakthrough to new and emerging markets and strengthening Europe's position as a major space player.
Scope: Activities under this topic will enable the development of innovative applications within international context and related standards with high international impact, ensuring that the EGNSS services are well known and can be used throughout the world. The objective is to support new proposals consisting of demonstrators of applications, adaptations of applications to a specific and local context outside of the European Union and the implementation of applications benefiting from multiple constellations, including Galileo. GNSS should be used as the primary positioning technology in the application and positioning should be a key enabler of the application. Third countries will be guided and supported in adapting services and developing applications corresponding to local needs and ensure that no unnecessary restriction to the use of the EGNSS is applied. Focus will be on regions of the world, which represent an attractive market for the European industry.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals are expected to foster application development through international cooperation and create a broad acceptance of EGNSS in non-European countries. The consortium should aim to transform the research results into innovation in third countries, through the networking of relevant technology developers with local academia, incubators, SMEs, representatives from civil society as well as local authorities, notably for the provision of public services, best practices and technology through the establishment of self-sustainable partnerships and collaborative initiatives.
Release of practical tools to the GNSS developer community, ideally with free open source license, is of particular interest.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Professional applications are covering different market segments. Precision agriculture, mapping and surveying have been the pioneers in the use of GNSS since the early years. The challenge is to make these applications more affordable, easy to use and integrated with other solutions and technologies, including for example earth observation, e.g. Copernicus services, in order to enable new targeted innovative solutions. EGNSS is offering additional accuracy and features, such as multiple frequencies and the high precision service in the frame of the future commercial service, contributing to enabling these innovative solutions, including in challenging environments. Power networks, telecommunication networks and financial transactions[1] are today synchronised, many of them using GNSS. These networks are becoming more and more distributed (e.g. distributed power generation of renewable energies), interconnected and more demanding in terms of synchronisation performances (e.g. in 4G-LTE and future internet), or requiring authenticated solutions as for the financial transaction time stamping. The specific challenge is in this case to build on the enhanced capabilities offered by Galileo that will provide high accurate timing information and authentication services, to develop a new generation of high performing, reliable and EU independent timing and synchronisation applications that can cope with these emerging and demanding needs.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at developing new innovative applications, building also on the combination of EGNSS with earth observation and Copernicus services, with commercial impact or with satellite communication. Proposals should have a clear market uptake perspective. Below are some areas which are identified as especially promising for further EGNSS application development:
Agriculture: Automated machine guidance, precision farming and machine control and field boundary measurements are possible areas to be addressed.
Surveying and Mapping: Land survey, marine survey, cadastral and geodesy, and construction are possible areas to be addressed.
Timing and Synchronisation: Telecommunications, power generation and finance are possible areas to be addressed.
Other professional applications: clearly demonstrating amongst others the contribution of EGNSS differentiators, the potential of integration with earth observation data, and the future commercial potential are also invited.
For all the professional areas, the development and innovation should build on:
Multiple-frequencies E1, E5 and E6;
Galileo specific signal modulation, e.g. AltBOC;
High precision and authentication services that will be provided by Galileo, i.e. in the frame of the commercial service;
Fusion with other data, such as from earth observation satellites or other in-situ sensors.
EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies is required to make the application(s) work, this is not excluded from the scope.
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
The proposal shall have a clear intention to commercialise the products and services developed, including a business plan.
Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities should aim at developing highly innovative applications taking advantage of Galileo and EGNOS aiming at decreasing the barriers to access such professional applications, in term of price of the solution and easiness to use, increasing the number of users and explore new innovative use of GNSS. Specifically for agriculture the expected impact is also to improve the productivity and decrease the environmental impact. For timing and synchronisation applications, the expected impact is to contribute to cope with emerging network synchronisation needs in terms of accuracy and robustness, while contributing to improve EU dependency from other GNSS.

Specific challenge:
National Contact Points need to be fully cognisant with the rules and procedures of Horizon 2020 if they are to provide high quality services to potential applicants. They also need to be proficient in the processes involved in running an NCP service itself. This is a continuous concern, as the programme evolves, lessons are learned, and as newcomers join the NCP network. A body of know-how is already held by the NCPs themselves, which needs to be made generally available, and further enhanced.
Scope:
Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs concerned with quality standards and cross-cutting issues across the NCP network in the country concerned. These NCPs will be the national coordinators, and the Legal and Financial NCPs, or other NCPs explicitly nominated by the national coordinators for participation in this network. The network will be a vehicle for building up and mobilising expertise, for providing training to the wider network of NCPs and for providing feedback and analysis to the Commission. Parts of the training programme will be provided by NPCs, third parties, or by Commission specialists. For this reason the network will work in consultation with the Commission service responsible for NCP coordination. It will solely address cross-cutting issues, such as: financial and legal issues from the submission and evaluation of the proposal to the signature and the implementation of the Grant; project coordination and management; project reporting; intellectual property rights; synergies with other sources of funding, notably European Structural and Investment Funds; research and innovation policy; gender equality and the gender dimension in research content, ethical and security issues and good practices for NCP work. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. Issues that are specific to the parts and challenges of Horizon 2020 will be addressed by the relevant networks under those areas, and will not be covered by this network. The network will also develop tools for monitoring quality standards (indicators, benchmarks etc.), and will provide an input to periodic policy meetings of national NCP coordinators and Legal and Financial NCPs. The applicants organisations will be the legal entities (ministry, agency, research body, company etc.) to which an NCP is affiliated (""host organisation""). In order to focus resources, the network can only include NCPs from EU Member States, and Associated Countries, who have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities.
The network should include a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPsOnly NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries and neighbourhood policy countries which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.

","Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU has a strong dependence on diesel, particularly for operating heavy duty vehicles (HDV). The use of alternative fuels in internal combustion engines could reduce this dependence in the short and medium term as well as achieve a significant level of GHG and pollutants emission reduction. Several gaseous and liquid alternatives could be appropriate fuels for trucks running over short, medium and long distances. The specific challenge is to optimise and develop new powertrains (engine / exhaust after treatment systems) for heavy duty vehicles running on alternative fuels with the perspective of achieving higher efficiency and lower pollutant emissions compliant with Euro VI standards and meeting CO2 emission targets under discussion.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on one or several of the following fuel options:
―Bio-methane mixed into liquefied natural gas: LNG is an attractive option to mitigate the high dependence of HDV on diesel. However, to achieve a significant level of GHG emission reduction, it is essential to shift from natural gas to bio-methane. Proposals should consider the results of the LNG Blue Corridors projects and other projects funded by the EU under the European Green Vehicles Initiative.
―Biofuels ED95 and B30: the use of E95 (95 % ethanol and 5% ignition improver) and B30 (30% Biodiesel and 70% of diesel) for HDV could reduce the EU dependence on diesel. E95 has been already been demonstrated in urban fleets but could be an appropriate fuel for trucks running over short and medium distances. Proposals should contribute to the transition from the 1st to the 2nd generation of such biofuels.
Proposals should focus on the following specific objectives:
―Optimise and develop new powertrains (engine/after treatment systems) for the use of alternative fuels in HDV.
―Evaluate energy efficiency, costs, performance, environmental benefits and durability of HDV running on alternative fuels.
Proposals should include prototype validation of the new vehicles. A small demonstration should be carried out to assess the energy efficiency and the environmental and economic benefits of the trucks running in real conditions.
Proposals should provide recommendations for the development of relevant standards, in particular for fuel quality requirements and for the type-approval of the heavy duty vehicles.
When biofuels are considered by proposals, they should be included in the assessment of sustainability and demonstrate compliance with sustainability criteria as specified in the article 17 of the Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives by the following achievements:
―Oil substitution through the use of alternative fuels.
―Reduction of GHG and pollutant emissions from transport using sustainable renewable fuels in heavy duty vehicles. In particular, polluting emissions below Euro VI with a Conformity Factor of 1.2 in real driving will be demonstrated.
―Market development for heavy duty vehicles running with sustainable renewable fuels.
The demonstration part of actions will help to improve the knowledge and general awareness of the alternative fuel as appropriate for short, medium or long distance road transport. Actions will also serve to remove the existing barriers for heavy duty vehicles running on renewable fuel.

","15 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Growing road traffic in Europe results in detrimental effects on the environment and public health to a level that is becoming unsustainable, this in spite of increasingly stringent emission standards. In particular, CO2 and noxious emissions are not sufficiently reduced in real driving, while higher injection pressures have led to a shift towards the emission of smaller nanoparticles that are undetected by current certification procedures.
Advanced technologies offer solutions but need to be further developed: on the one hand a new generation of engine components has reached a sufficient level of maturity but more research for their optimal combination in a new generation of engines is needed; on the other hand, hybridised engines where ICE are coupled with electric drives that are able to supply instantaneous torque still need to be optimised introducing radically new combustion processes to reach much higher energy conversion, thus approaching the physical limits.
Scope:
Proposals should address one of the following domains:
―New generation of non-hybrid engines based on existing engine technologies (short term developments): proposals will address the optimal combination of innovative engine and robust after-treatment technologies as well as modelling and testing to improve the design and control capability. Special attention should be given to the assessment and reduction of particle emissions below 23 nm, particularly for direct injection gasoline and diesel engines.
―Future combustion engines for electrified powertrains (longer term developments): new combustion processes, sensing, control and after treatment systems, supported by advanced modelling technologies where needed to allow these engines to meet future ambitious energy and emission targets simultaneously. Special attention should be given to the assessment and reduction of particle emissions below 23 nm, particularly for direct injection gasoline and diesel engines.
―Development (based on current direct injection engines) of the related measurement procedures down to 10nm, providing a contribution to future regulation on particle emissions, in particular in real driving conditions.
Proposals could foresee cooperation with entities participating in similar projects funded by Japan and US to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies in view of establishing future international standards and regulations on nanoparticle emissions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million for the domains on engines would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately; smaller projects are expected under the domain on particle measurement. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research projects will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives by delivering significant reductions of CO2 emissions (thus addressing the global warming challenge) and by improving noxious emissions (thus allowing better air quality in European cities). To achieve these impacts proposals will need to show how they intend to meet the following targets:
―For new generation of non-hybrid engines, demonstration vehicles incorporating each of the developed new engine technologies will prove, by independent testing, a reduction of WLTP[1] CO2 emissions respectively of 5% for diesel and 15% for gasoline, with respect to the best equivalent size and torque engines on the market in 2015. At the same time they should demonstrate real driving emissions at least below upcoming Euro 6 RDE[2] limits (with particle number emissions measured with a 10 nm threshold).
―For future combustion engines for electrified power-trains, the innovative engines are expected to support the achievement of long term fleet targets of 50 g/km CO2 on the WLTP by demonstrating (on the bench with simulation support to emulate real driving and/or on a vehicle, depending on the starting TRL of the technology), a peak thermal conversion efficiency of more than 50%and real driving Euro 6 values with no conformity factor (with particle number emissions measured with a10 nm threshold.
―Projects related to particle measurements will also support the understanding, measurement and regulation of particle emissions below 23 nm (with the threshold of at least 10 nm).
Overall, research projects will contribute to the establishment of a future 'EU Super Low Emission Vehicles' standard.

However, a major challenge for this type of vehicle is the cost of its technology in relation to the benefit for end users and the variety of configurations that are possible. This topic is focused on the development of advanced solutions which reduce both the cost and complexity of pure hybrid, plug-in hybrid and range extended electric vehicles, and their effective mechanical, thermal and electrical integration into the vehicle.
Scope:
Proposals should address all the following aspects in light-duty and/or heavy-duty vehicles:
―For range extended electric vehicles, development of novel high efficiency and high power density energy generators and close integration with electric systems.
―For pure and plug-in hybrids, power-train system integration and optimisation through the re-use of waste heat, advanced control, downsizing of ICEs, innovative transmissions and the integration of high temperature electronic components.
For all applications, identify potential for cost reduction by technical simplification of engine and/or transmission systems and lower cost energy storage as well as improved after-treatment operation to control of emissions, particularly in case of cold (re)start and optimised use of auxiliary systems, and, where economically justified, the re-use of waste heat.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
: In general, the cost premium for hybrid powertrains can be greater than the value of benefits to the user. The impact from this work will be to deliver improved benefits to the consumer and/or cost reductions that will lead to greater market penetration for this technology. Specifically, the expected impacts will consist of:
―Reduction of cost at system level to a 5% premium over best in class 2015 non-hybrid diesel vehicle of equivalent size (15% for 30 km range plug-in solutions) when produced at a rate consistent with an overall 10% hybrid market penetration.
―Contribution to climate action and sustainable development objectives by improving energy efficiency, resulting in higher fuel economy over the WLTP of 20% in the short to medium term and improvements in electric drive range of more than 25% for plug-in solutions at constant battery capacity depending on application and drive cycle duty.
―Reduction of combustion engine raw emissions, thereby allowing cost reduction in the exhaust after-treatment system. Vehicle demonstration of real driving emissions compliance with a 1.5 compliance factor is mandatory for each developed technology.
―Improvement of gradeability, drive-off performance and acceleration performance compared with a conventional vehicle.
―Improved user acceptance for range extender systems delivering an improved driver experience and utility.

Increasing the range of vehicles, and in particular EVs, requires the minimisation of the overall energy consumption of which a significant share, depending strongly on the ambient conditions, is often due to the systems (for de-icing/de-fogging, heating, cooling, etc.) required to ensure the safety, comfort and well-being of the vehicle occupants. Correspondingly, there is a need to focus on all aspects of the user-centric design of EVs (mainly cars, with potential synergies with heavier vehicles) from the perspective of energy consumption in order to develop advanced solutions which will enable the range of the vehicle to be increased significantly without compromising safety, EV users requirements, all factors that directly affect the competitiveness of EVs with respect to conventional vehicles.
Scope:
Proposals should address all the following aspects:
―Analysis of all aspects of the user-centric design of vehicles which directly or indirectly impact energy consumption in a significant way (including visibility, thermal comfort, HMI, ergonomics, postural comfort, noise and vibration, etc.) that may require the development of new methodologies and design tools. Consideration should be taken of gender aspects and other demographic factors such as ageing.
―Development of solutions, including the application of novel materials, to improve the thermal insulation of vehicles and hence reduce the energy consumption needs over a wide range of ambient conditions.
―Integration of advanced systems and components, and their control, considering also preconditioning, in order to optimise occupant comfort and well-being with respect to energy consumption.
―Reducing the weight and thermal inertia of systems and components (including the windshield and window, seats, dashboard, trim, etc.) in the vehicle in order to improve efficiency without reducing performance.
―Implementation and testing of the different solutions at the full vehicle level in order to ensure that the safety (including during and after crash) and perception of comfort and well-being remain uncompromised.
An assessment of the applicability of the solutions developed across different types of EVs should be carried out.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to increase 25% the electric drive range of EVs across a wide extent of ambient conditions. This improvement will be achievable on production in the short- to medium-term. Actions will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives by achieving an improved energy efficiency without compromising in terms of both the performance of the respective systems and components (including de-icing/de-fogging, heating, cooling, lighting) and the safety, comfort and well-being of the vehicle occupants.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Growing urbanisation in Europe is generating increased traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution. Economic development requires an efficient and sustainable mobility system and European citizens need affordable and adaptable transport options through synergies between different modes. L-category vehicles, for individual passenger transport and for small logistics, are an effective solution to address the growing problems of traffic congestion in towns and cities across the EU. Smaller, lighter and more specialised than other vehicles, their use produces economic savings in terms of time gained, energy consumption and space required for moving and parking. Electrified L-category vehicles (EL-Vs) are a further step towards an even more sustainable urban mobility but they are still a niche market, mainly due to cost, lack of public information and limited direct user experience. However, last generation EL-Vs, and those currently under development, could meet mainstream customer expectations and contribute to urban quality of life.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on the demonstration of the potential market penetration of EL-Vs in different European cities. It should enable EL-V manufacturers to make vehicles more attractive to the general public, support a mind-shift and encourage the uptake of EL-Vs (in particular two/three wheelers and light quadricycles). The demonstration of EL-Vs as private, shared, or service vehicles will make the public more familiar with easy to operate EL-Vs and allow overcoming issues such as range anxiety. Enabling users to experience the wide range of EL-Vs as part of their daily personal mobility, will make them more aware of their real mobility needs and allow the integration of EL-Vs with other private and public modes of transport. Surveys among private and professional users should measure in how far the demonstration projects provide attractive services and match market demands.
The scope includes deployment of ICT tools for driver support and services such as communication with back-office, booking, route scheduling, real time monitoring of vehicle performance to enhance eco-driving and for integrating EL-Vs into the urban transport. The scope also includes the compatibility of EL-Vs with other vehicles’ charging stations and with cheaper charging devices, such as home chargers.
Compatibilities and potential incompatibilities between different categories of vehicles (L, M, N) should be identified and documented, suitable to serve as a basis for creating or adapting street rules, type approval regulations, standards and policy measures for the deployment of an effective charging infrastructure.
The consortium should have at least two cities as beneficiaries.
In order to maximise the impact in this topic, the focus of investments planned in these proposals should be on the demonstration of the potential market penetration of EL-Vs in different European cities, rather than purchasing the actual vehicles and their appropriate infrastructure.
This topic is particularly relevant for SME participation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 to 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
As described in the specific challenge above, the demonstration will contribute to assess the potential market penetration of EL-Vs and consumers’ needs and expectations.
Actions are expected to give details on their contribution to speed up the penetration of EL-Vs into the market and will supply the manufacturer with crucial information for the development and the engineering work of the next generation of EL-Vs.
The work on deployment of ICT tools for driver support and services is expected to give the vehicle manufacturers and mobility service providers the necessary information to develop successful business models.
Actions will demonstrate how the proposed innovation will contribute to quality of life in urban environments (including commuting), and will provide recommendations for effective policy measures supporting the deployment of EVs, as well as for an optimised grid and charging infrastructure, able to guarantee compatibility among different type of EVs.
In addition, the demonstration will provide data on real driving conditions useful to design policy measures (i.e. optimal amount and distribution of public charging points, identification and possible areas accessible only to electrical L vehicles, interaction with other means of transport and vulnerable road users).
Project results will also contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives.

Detailed modelling and testing at component and sub-component level (for instance in electrochemistry and electromagnetics) can be used to improve the understanding and design capabilities for higher performance and lower cost, allowing to recover or maintain technological leadership in key sectors of the EV value chain. Whenever the knowledge is fragmented, a truly European effort is preferred to help shorten the development and validation time of the tools. New technologies and new materials will enable further improvements in EV-efficiency but will also add complexity in control, calibration and safety analysis. Novel tools are required particular for covering the entire chain of integration into vehicles and subsystems. Consequently there is a need for advanced testing methods and tools as well as scalable and easy to parameterise real-time models for usage in different development environments in order to ensure safety and improve efficiency of future EVs and hence reducing development and testing efforts significantly.
Scope:

―Investigations on scalable real-time models for e-drive components (e-motor, batteries, inverters, fuel-cell, etc. ) that seamlessly can be used for design, simulation, diagnosis and testing based on existing models and corresponding test and modelling procedures to automatically identify parameters of these models.
―Development of heterogeneous testing facility for electric traction drive and storage system that enable the functional optimisation, testing and diagnosis of new e-drive concepts at higher frequencies and voltages.
―Development of systems and methods to assess reliability, energy content and commercial certainty for battery systems at all levels of technology, from cell via packs, vehicles to recycling.

Electrification of different types of transportation and delivery typically in urban and suburban areas (including buses, vans, medium trucks, and specialist vehicles such as trucks for refuse collection) is a privileged path to reduce their energy consumption and emissions. At the same time, achieving the same range capabilities using large over-night charged batteries would undermine their payload capacity and vehicle performance (e.g. acceleration and hill climbing ability). It is therefore necessary to integrate either a range extender or solutions for the fast transfer of significant energy volumes, be it at terminals, loading/de-loading stops or in-route. However, large magnitude power transfer directly from the grid can be costly and introduce disturbances into the grid. Furthermore, large power flows in relation to the total energy capacity of the involved energy storage systems may be harmful to the energy storage systems. Therefore, the different options of rapid charging at stops and terminus need to be assessed and compared with respect to cost and their impact on the power grid. The overall challenge is to design integrated, energy efficient low emission vehicles taking into account the powertrain, energy storage and the charging infrastructure needed to cover the intended missions, without compromising on vehicle performance or comfort and safety of the vehicle driver and occupants or increasing the final costs to the users/customers.

Actions should address the development of vehicle drive train concepts and energy storage (battery and super-capacitor) which can deliver the required vehicle performance and are able to operate in a pure electric mode with high energy recovery capacity. This will ensure zero emissions and low noise pollution either on the whole mission or in designated low-emission zones, while permitting in the second case highly efficient, low environmental impact internal combustion engine operation without range restrictions in other areas. Such technologies can be applied to one or both of the following vehicle types:
―Electrified medium duty trucks for urban and peri-urban applications (freight delivery, refuse collection, etc.) capable of time efficient operation.
―Electrified high capacity (at least 12 m) buses for urban use, capable of following normal timetables and when needed to effectively charge and drive at bus stops with multiple bus lines.
For both above applications, where appropriate, development and integration in the vehicles, of power transfer solutions for ultrafast (< 30 seconds), superfast (< 5 minutes) and/or fast (< 30-50 minutes) wireless and contact-based electric energy transfer technologies, demonstrating how the system level efficiency and economic impacts can be achieved, including amortisation of infrastructure.
To ensure the acceptability of such systems into the market, negative effects on battery life and the grid, and measures to mitigate them should also be developed and integrated in the global system, as well as standardisation and health and safety implications.
Extension of these concepts to lighter vehicles should be taken into account wherever appropriate to enhance opportunities for exploitation.
An interaction with interested European cities to provide input on needs and implementation plans will be performed targeting market readiness by 2023.
Proposals could foresee cooperation with entities participating in projects funded by Japan and US to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies in the field of fast charging and its impact on infrastructure in view of establishing future international standards.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 15 million each depending on the number of developed vehicles and charging technologies would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
All actions will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives by achieving the following targets.
For electrified medium duty trucks for urban use:
―Energy efficiency improvements up to 70% in comparison with equivalent category conventional vehicles are targeted, with full electric driving ranges of at least 50 km (including energy recuperation and superfast charging at delivery stops).
―Low noise operation (<72 dB) allowing e.g. off peak delivery.
―Polluting emissions below Euro VI with a Conformity Factor of 1.2 in real driving when in range extended mode.
For electrified high capacity buses for urban use:
―Bus energy efficiency improvements similar to dual mode medium duty trucks, with an average speed compatible with normal bus operation, depending on whether charging take place only at end terminals or at bus stops.
―Polluting emissions below Euro VI with a Conformity Factor of 1.2 in real driving when in range extended mode.
―Reduced operating costs competitive with conventional low emissions buses or trucks.
For fast charging infrastructure:
―Power transfer capability above 100kW
―Transfer efficiencies above 90% for static contactless systems

","04 October 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The energy efficiency of logistics and co-modal transportation needs to be significantly improved, since road haulage represents the dominant share of CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Adaptable and configurable complete truck concepts and architectures can significantly contribute to improving road haulage energy efficiency, by improving aerodynamics and energy efficiency, while contributing to meet future logistics and co-modality needs for different segments and markets. Industry, authorities and policy-makers should collaborate on standardisation issues in order to allow the use of configurable trucks in road haulage. The present regulatory framework is not conducive to some of the developments suggested above. Revisions of existing regulations are needed and could benefit from results of this action, e.g. the present work with Directive 96/53/EC, which will allow greater flexibility in terms of vehicle length provided improvements in efficiency and safety can be demonstrated.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following aspects:
―Map, quantify and predict the type of loads carried on roads in Europe and define potential solutions for configurable trucks.
―Develop new concepts and technologies for trucks with reduced drag, which are safer, comfortable, configurable and cost effective, and ensure satisfaction of different kinds of customer needs and adaptability to actual type of tasks and circumstances.
―Provide inputs for revising the standardisation and regulatory framework.
―Demonstrate potential in real time vehicle boundary configuration for best aerodynamics and energy management adapting to the specific load.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives by targeting overall efficiency gains of at least 18-33% demonstrated on real platforms, broken down as follows:
―4–5% improvement in energy efficiency by separate platforms for volume and weight freight, respectively.
―4–6% improvement in energy consumption due to more effective loading space utilisation.
―5–12% energy efficiency improvement (depending on traffic circumstances) from the integration of more elaborate flexible powertrains.
―5–10% improvement in energy consumption due to improved truck aerodynamics.
―Standardised interfaces and the resulting sharing of components leading to higher economies of scale.
―The innovative front end design will increase energy absorption for vehicles and for pedestrians to ensure survivability in crashes up to 50 km/h.

","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: It is important that next generations of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles incorporate basic electric components, such as electric batteries and their constituent components, that are manufactured in Europe. This is not the case for the first generation of these vehicles that incorporate non-European battery technologies. The challenge to be addressed is the development of new materials, facilities and technologies for advanced Li-ion batteries to support the development of a strong European industrial base in this field. This challenge is complementary to the above mentioned battery electrochemistry topic pursuing longer terms solutions in the Advanced Materials Work Programme of 2014.
Scope: Proposals should be based on a multidisciplinary approach to pursue the optimisation of the electrochemistry to hone parameters critical to customer acceptance: cost, safety aspects, resistance to high-power charging, durability, recyclability and the impact of hybridisation with other types of storage systems (e.g. ultracapacitors), as well as consideration of scale-up for manufacturing.
In addition, better knowledge on the ageing mechanism and its modelling are needed in order to support test procedures and the development of standards. In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation to establish world-level standard is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 8 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research and innovation activities will bring European industry to a stronger position on the world market making it possible to launch new production in Europe while at the same time addressing the shortcomings of electric cars as compared to conventional cars (e.g. cost and weight reduction, safety, reliability, longevity and fitness for charging under real world conditions). The proposed solutions should demonstrate industrial scale prototypes improving cell-level energy densities by at least 20%, and costs by 20%, with respect to the best cell chemistries currently on the market.

provide new secure and energy-efficient data management tools improving the usability and discoverability of data in different contexts, covering data provenance, synthetic data generation, data quality management (such as data cleaning, validation, enrichment, co-creation, identification of bias and correlations), improving data interoperability, metadata management (automated ways of labelling and describing data, data linkage), and ensuring data security, privacy and integrity, especially in the context of data spaces.
Scope:
The actions under this topic are expected to provide practical, robust and scalable tools to improve the interoperability, quality, and integrity of data and metadata, in the context of other topics of the heading “Data sharing in the common European data space”. The data management tools and systems should support a holistic approach of the data life cycle and comply with accountability, fairness and confidentiality as well as the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for data and metadata management. Building on results of relevant past and current initiatives, data management tools, systems and processes are expected to enable, support and/or automate the creation and maintenance of common ontologies, vocabularies and data models and/or structured, standardised and automated authoring, co-creation, curation, annotation and labelling of data, in view of different later uses (especially AI) made of the data. The actions are expected to create links with relevant initiatives collecting/using heterogeneous/linguistic data, including AI initiatives (such as AI4EU, European Language Grid, or the projects from the H2020 topic ICT-48), and liaise with standardization bodies, where appropriate.
Actions are expected to deal with gaps and needs identified in real-world data space management and real-world data heterogeneity challenges (encoding formats, multiple languages, collection mechanisms, access methods, etc.), supporting, where necessary, hybrid/adaptive approaches and models, leading to robust, reliable and automated annotation of unstructured data sources. The tools should contribute to minimization of the energy footprint, be adaptable to different user needs and support and encourage new business models and (where appropriate) citizen involvement and social innovation. The tools should be demonstrated by diverse use cases. Provision of open source tools is encouraged to contribute to outreach and impact.

Reduced congestion in data communication when a multiplicity of applications compete for simultaneous delivery, thereby causing data loss or a delay in data delivery;
Reduced power consumption to some pico-Joule per bit through the broader use of optical networking technologies, interconnects, and integrated optical communication components;
Lowered barrier for the uptake of performant communication technologies by reducing cost of transmission interfaces to around 50 cents per Gigabit per second.
Scope:
Proposals to develop ultra-dynamic photonic components and subsystems for data communication, using for example new optical wavelength bands, space division multiplexing, new integration schemes, optical switching and new switching paradigms, as solutions for time-deterministic and time-sensitive networks. They should also enable ultra-dynamic reconfiguration on the optical layer and mitigate amplifier power transients, while saving energy, improving bandwidth efficiency, and guaranteeing low deterministic latencies across the network. Emerging solutions, e.g. based on free space optical communication may be explored as well.
Advances will cover a range of use cases for example from optical switching in commercial applications to optical flow or packet switching approaches that would become practical for the industrial Internet. Where relevant for the application, devices should be able to work in a harsh environment such as within a wide temperature operating range, or in high humidity.

Proposal results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Next generation of higher-level (meta) operating systems for the smart Internet of Things with strong computing capacity at the smart device, system and edge-level, embedded in a compute continuum from IoT-to-edge-to-cloud. Such Operating system should be device independent and implement advanced concepts such as ad-hoc clouds, time-triggered IoT, and decentralised intelligence.
Increasing European autonomy in data processing required to support future hyper-distributed applications by building open platforms and an open edge ecosystem including business models, driven by European actors.
Achieving trust in these (meta) operating systems among actors in diverse industrial ecosystems by leveraging open standards and - where applicable - open source.
Emergence of an open edge ecosystem including midcaps, SMEs and start-ups that foster the up-take of an edge operating system, e.g. through a modular functional spectrum of executable apps and services, for nurturing a European network of innovators and developers.
Demonstrators in key industrial and societal applications, which in future require more power at the edge.
Scope:
Europe needs to strengthen its supply and value chains in cloud to edge computing by integrating relevant elements of computing, connectivity, IoT, AI and cybersecurity. Exploiting network functions such as adhoc - cloud/fog communication not limited to 5G , the objective is to develop meta operating systems for the edge that enable cloud and edge computing orchestrations by bringing computation, data and intelligence closer to where the data is produced (sensors and devices) and by which volume, variety, interoperability, and velocity should be handled efficiently and securely. This will make AI training and inference at the edge viable and lead to a next generation of internet-enabled automation concepts virtualizing computing and networking functions, multi-state analytics and digital twinning of underlying objects to improve end-to-end response time, to optimise the CO2 footprint and benefit from the use of renewable energy sources. Validation should be done through proof of concept or prototype implementations for at least 3 different applications in domains such as mobility, logistics, manufacturing, energy and other utilities, buildings or farming.
Proposals are expected to use financial support to third parties (FSTP) to support industry, in particular SMEs, in take-up of emerging edge topologies, for populating and validating relevant use cases through experiments. A maximum of 20% of the budget is expected to be dedicated to FSTP and the maximum amount of FSTP is EUR 150.000 per third party for the entire duration of the action.

Scope:
Evolving photonic integration is opening up a wealth of opportunities in many application areas by enhancing functionality and spectral coverage, facilitating new applications in biomedical, environmental and industrial fields, making devices more power-efficient and bringing ground-breaking technologies within reach of entrepreneurial SMEs.
The increasingly sophisticated requirements need new paradigms, capable of extending the functionalities of optical components through design, integration, fabrication, assembly and packaging techniques including the co-integration of photonic and electronic components. These need to be augmented with new functions and performance enhancements, requiring in many cases the development of new materials and innovative device structures.
Challenges are for example in mastering epitaxial material growth and processing on large wafers with improved quality, uniformity and very low defect densities, broadband (“white”) light sources and high sensitivity photodetectors (including arrays) and high-efficiency semiconductor lasers across many wavelength bands, capable of withstanding high temperatures (>85°C) depending on the intended application.

The way plastics are currently made, used and discarded, fails to capture the economic, environmental and societal benefits of a more sustainable approach. Europe produces 25 million tons of plastic waste annually, less than 30% is recycled. Moreover, plastic production, use and disposal may result in the release of chemicals, which may give rise to health and environmental problems. The development of a common understanding and the transition to safe- and sustainable-by-design materials, including plastics, is a societal urgency.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Recyclable-by-design polymers with inherent recyclability properties for polymers where nowadays recyclability challenge is high;
Safer (lower toxicity) plastics, with less reliance on potentially harmful additives;
Reduced environmental footprint associated with the end-of-life phase of the polymers due to increased recyclability and /or reduced reliance on potentially harmful additives, compared with existing products for similar applications;
Contribute to the development of safe- and sustainable-by-design criteria and guiding principles and apply them to polymers;
Identification of priorities for substitution of plastic additives;
New technologies and business opportunities for recycling industry across EU.
Scope:
Thanks to their versatility, polymeric materials are used in a wide range of applications from consumer goods and construction to aerospace. The proposals should focus on:
The design and development of new recyclable polymer systems substituting/improving nowadays difficult to recycle polymers e.g. PVC, thermosets or multicomponent (multilayer or blend) polymers;
The design and development of safer plastics with less reliance on potentially harmful additives, e.g. plasticizers. The approach should allow to decrease their health and environmental impact and improve the purity of the secondary raw material and thus the quality of recycled plastic without compromising the material optimal properties and functionality;
Carrying out an inventory of additives detected in plastics and their function and toxicity;
Integration of safe- and sustainable-by-design aspects, including safety (toxicity), circularity and functionality of advanced polymeric materials, products and processes throughout their lifecycle.
The proposals, activities and approaches should cover both - specific considerations for the plastics under study, as well as developing overarching best practices that spans broader sectors of safe- and sustainable-by-design plastics. Proposals should involve all the actors in the value chain from the chemical and material industry, to formulators, recyclers and regulators. Areas for research include the intersection between chemicals and waste legislation.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

New metal coating systems, produced without, and free of, toxic substances (e.g. hexavalent Chromium), HREEs (heavy rare earth elements), LREEs (light rare earth elements), and PGMs (platinum group metals). A major challenge is the accumulation of metallic materials over the long term in the environment where they tend to have adverse reactions with the ecosystem. On the other hand, the coatings are needed for preservation of the products to prevent for instance corrosion and (bio)fouling. To ensure safety and sustainability of new metal coatings a systems approach that integrates safety, circularity and functionality of advanced materials throughout their lifecycle is required.

This should include integration of REACH requirements in the eco-design development and pre-validation of indicators as well as tests to demonstrate the improved sustainability and reduced toxicity of both final product and production process;
Innovative strategies for improving recovery, recyclability, purification and re-use products at the end of life. This could include the evaluation of their reusability in other application areas other than initial intended use, requiring lower purity inputs;

A shift from fired- to electrically-heated catalytic reactors, powered by renewables will lead to a large decrease in CO2 emissions, coupled with a significant process intensification. As currently reactors are kept at high target temperatures in industrial-scale catalytic processes with energy supplied by the combustion of fossil fuels, substitution of fossil-fuel-derived heating with emissions-free alternatives will substantially contribute to the greening of large industries. This requires the re-design of the reactor and in parallel with the development of novel catalysts as well as integration of up and downstream processes to operate with optimal energy efficiency and product yield.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The benefits of a hydrogen based economy are well documented, since hydrogen is an abundant zero emission fuel, and possesses a higher energy density than conventional fossil fuels (e.g. petrol). However, safe hydrogen storage, either long or short term, faces several challenges. Chemical storage is the prevailing method for long term storage due to the high storage density but the synthesis process needs further development to make it commercially attractive. Pressurised gaseous storage is the most attractive in practical terms but compression up to 700bar is needed to achieve practical volumetric storage capacities for transport applications, which requires expensive pressure vessels and is inherently dangerous. However, new approaches using ultra porous materials have demonstrated the feasibility of high storage densities of gaseous hydrogen at pressure of 100bar.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Provide commercially attractive and safe new technologies for long-term storage and transport of hydrogen;
Enable efficient and safe hydrogen short term storage for example for fuel tanks for automobiles, rail vehicles, ships, airplanes, or stationary storage, etc., eliminating pollution caused by fossil fuels and facilitating the greening of transport;
Elimination of economic dependence for EU’s energy needs;
Ability for distributed production, providing opportunities for new business ventures and the development of new centres for economic growth in both rural and urban areas that currently find it difficult to attract investment in the current centralised energy system.
Scope:
Research proposals should address at least one of the following:
Development of new environmentally friendly catalysts for ammonia synthesis at low pressures for long term hydrogen storage and distribution;
Development of new ultra porous materials for hydrogen storage with a gravimetric storage capacity in excess of 6 wt% and a volumetric storage capacity in excess of 40g/lt. The use of machine learning techniques to assess combinations and substitutions in various porous materials to help optimise the development process should also be considered; the development of suitable pressure vessel designs and materials for the containment of the adsorbent ultra-porous materials should also be addressed.
For long-term storage the proposals are expected to produce a demonstrator plant for low pressure chemical synthesis. Similarly, for the short-term storage solution a demonstrator pressure vessel containing ultra-porous hydrogen adsorbents should be produced.
The proposed solutions should also include full LCA of the new developed materials, (catalysts, ultra-porous materials) and processes (synthesis process, ultra-porous material production).
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

A scaling up of capabilities in matching EU-funded technology solutions developed by highly innovative sustainable and digital startups with access to finance and growth opportunities including, but not limited to, other European funding instruments (such as the Digital Europe Programme and EIC), innovation procurement, investors and corporate innovation ventures.
Deliver, through tech due diligence and venture-building approaches, a step change in the number of new ventures created and ventures’ ability to attract funding for sustainable and digital innovations developed in EU-funded R&I.
Scope:
The action will use intelligence from the Innovation Radar platform[1] to: facilitate tech due diligence and the building of new ventures based on high-potential innovations and upscaling of HE-funded startups. This will in particular include matching of EU-funded innovations and the innovators behind them with finance and growth opportunities offered by investors, other European funding programmes (including the Digital Europe Programme and EIC), innovation procurement and corporate innovation ventures.
Specific support will be devoted to pilot tech due diligence and venture-building services[2]. The services to be piloted will allow investors to better valuate the technology behind innovations, enable more precise valuations of digital start-ups and prepare their investment readiness. The tech due diligence services will deliver a benefit to spinoffs, startups and scale-ups by improving their access to finance. The pilot will also implement ‘venture-building’ approaches to dramatically increase the number of new ventures created on the basis of technological breakthroughs that may otherwise be at risk of remaining ‘in the lab’ despite their market or disruptive potential.
The focus is on strategic digital and industrial technologies.
The cross-cutting action will act as a catalyst to fulfil the potential of startups, in particular those who have secured EU funding (Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020), in delivering market-ready applications and technology solutions that can contribute to the competitiveness and open strategic autonomy of EU industry in key technology areas and value chains. It is foreseen that the communities targeted by the action(s) will contribute to developing applications that foster climate-neutrality, the circular economy, clean industry and user-centric technology development, while also encouraging inclusiveness, and incorporating European social and ethical values.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Integrate breakthrough technologies derived from other industries: examples include additive manufacturing; human robot collaboration; autonomous vehicles in construction activities; autonomous maintenance, diagnostics and monitoring;
Demonstrate the impact of the use of these new breakthrough technologies on the efficiency of resources (raw materials, water etc.), the reduction of waste and embodied CO2 emissions;
Demonstrate the safety of these breakthrough technologies on a construction environment in cooperation with workers;
Demonstrate a reduction of dependency for importing breakthrough technologies related to additive manufacturing, human robot collaboration or autonomous vehicles;
Increase the wellbeing of the construction workforce concerned.
Scope:
There is a global trend for higher digitalisation in the construction sector. In this context, there is a major need to ensure that construction activities in countries in Europe do not depend on breakthrough technologies the industry concerned needs to import from outside Europe to remain competitive. Currently, the construction sector is among the least automated and digitised and the most labour accident-prone sectors in the Europe. Therefore, the use of technologies such as additive manufacturing, autonomous vehicles and human robot collaboration in a construction environment is crucial to increase the degree of digitalisation of the sector. In addition, Member States are facing a shortage of skilled labour force in construction activities. In the same vein, a higher degree of digitalisation would make the construction sector attractive for younger generations and construction sites a safer working environment. Proposal consortiums are encouraged to include a wide range of stakeholders from SMEs to large construction firms.
The projects should:
Develop, test and promote the necessary technologies, devices and systems for an highly automated construction site;
Demonstrate all developed solutions in at least four diverse construction sites (such as roadwork, bridges, tunnels, different types of buildings, etc.) across different countries in Europe;
Develop solutions for monitoring the wellbeing of the workforce and prevention of accidents taking into account gender and intersectional perspective;
All solutions developed should be evaluated by the users (site management, workforce, etc.) through surveys or other means;
Proposals should consider the development of learning resources for the current and future generations of employees, with the possibility to integrate them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes;

Project is expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Establish a European Community of Practice (ECoP) as an effective and sustainable forum/platform connecting hubs for circularity (H4C) and all actors willing to invest in industrial urban-symbiosis (I-US), towards building new circular value chains;
Provide up-to-date support to the H4C by collecting and evaluating knowledge, tools, models and solutions and making them accessible to the community, preparing training material dedicated to circular practitioners that can drive the H4C roll out across Europe;
Define a set of methodologies and kits of specific KPIs (e.g. a kit for any single industrial sector) to enable the progress quantification of circularity and symbiosis with particular attention to the definition of gaps to be closed in order to reach the expected impact.
Analyse collaboration models, non-technological barriers, tools, technologies and existing solutions for I-US and circularity, especially those from previously funded projects;
Provide a state-of-play analysis of regions/areas best suited for the first implementation of advanced H4C in Europe, coupled with a detailed study of the strength and weaknesses of the regions/areas selected, including a symbiosis maturity level (Symbiosis Readiness Level, SRL)[1] and a number of specific scenarios for the technology and process implementation;
Establish a roadmap on how to achieve an effective implementation of a certain number of first-of-a-kind pilots of advanced H4C by 2026, supported by a solid blended funding strategy, targeting the accomplishment of 2050 Green Deal Goals;
Spread the H4C concept to all regions of Europe, support the H4C cooperation network and promote the transfer of the circular models across sectors and borders;
Stimulate public and private investments in circular economy projects;
Set up an effective collaboration with stakeholders represented in the P4Planet partnership, including non-governmental associations, and provide a solid plan for the continuation and self-financing of ECoP after the completion of the project;
Drive and coordinate business-to-territory relationships in the area in which the H4C, or neighbouring H4C, are located (i.e. with authorities, SMEs, associations, educational organisations, civil society, etc.).
Scope:
Circularity is an essential part of the industry transformation towards climate-neutrality and long-term competitiveness. H4C are defined as first-of-a-kind, lighthouse demonstrator plants of commercial size implementing industrial symbiosis or urban industrial symbiosis with the aim of achieving a step change in circular utilization of resources and GHG emission reductions, within a given representative geographical area. H4C have strong technological focus and industrial dimension, but their implementation leverages elements well beyond R&I. Specific implementation (including funding) strategies will have to be designed, ensuring the participation of all stakeholders (Industry, SMEs, local authorities, educational institutions and civil society). The common target is to collectively achieve and demonstrate at scale a leap towards circularity and carbon neutrality in the use of resources (feedstock, energy and water) in a profitable way.
The ECoP is a tool for connecting the Hubs and the community of interest into a network for exchanging tools and knowledge across regions. It has also been proposed by Processes4Planet partnership. The project will embrace possibly all existing H4C and circular systemic activities and strongly link with the activities of relevant European Partnerships, such as P4Planet.
The ECoP should:
Gather, evaluate and synthesise state-of-the-art knowledge on circularity and industrial symbiosis and work out their benefits for climate neutrality and competitiveness in relation to their possible applications. This work should embrace the outcomes of all previously funded projects and be subject to constant updates;
Characterise, classify and evaluate systematically symbiosis and circularity-related solutions with a constant update of symbiosis and circularity-related solutions;
Draw up a list of specifications/criteria for best suited areas/regions taking into account lifting up or expanding existing hubs;
Analyse in detail suitable regions/areas in the EU for H4C implementation. The regions/areas to consider should involve all alternative resource streams relevant for process industries as potential source of feedstock or as utilities, I-US scenarios and infrastructures that are already in place; scrutinise co-investment scenarios (combination of public and private means) to reach high Symbiosis Readiness Levels (SRL).
Analyse proven involvement of regions and local communities;
Identify high-potential regions/areas, for developing the first demonstrator of H4C by 2026. Such identification should be justified on the basis of objective criteria and should be open to further regions in the course of the project. Criteria should focus on process level, symbiosis process implementation, commitment level of the local authorities and communities, regional specificities (business/industrial policy and strategies), additional funding, potential private investors, etc. These hubs should become lighthouse examples of win-win cooperation between industry, SMEs, public authorities, educational institutions and civil society on circular economy beyond 2026;
The H4C could be thematic at first (e.g. focus on valorisation of emissions or circular use of plastic waste, etc.) and evolve after a successful first demonstration into a broader concept, attracting other players from other industry sectors at local, regional, national or European level and enabling industrial symbiosis in new areas and processes;
Propose stakeholder events for local and regional authorities creating awareness on industrial opportunities and challenges based on the analysis;
Connect the regional H4C and ensure a mutually profitable knowledge and experience exchange;
Provide support and advice to the community members, as well as, tutorials and learning framework about state-of-the-art solutions (for technical and non-technical problems);
Promote the role and service of enablers/facilitators as a new type of service to industry, regions and civil society;
Support the transfer of knowledge, tools and innovation across the H4C, and the programming groups or ad-hoc task forces;
Engage with stakeholders, such as, universities or other educational institutions to facilitate the training of circular practitioners. These practitioners should have an in-depth understanding of I-US, the state-of-the-art tools and databases and newest business models;
Track regional needs based on feedback of H4C and other supporting members in order to optimise the support;
Enable and regularly update evaluation of I-US projects by providing systematic knowledge on gaps and potential impacts, and favour connection with regions/areas of high potential for a first successful implementation of a H4C;
Identify potential sites for setting up emerging new hubs based on mapping of I-US and circular activities as a continuous update and extension of the pre-implementation analysis.
The EU funded projects under Process4Planet, Made in Europe and Clean Steel but also under cluster 6 dealing with circularity will be required to provide complete information and full collaboration to the ECoP platform.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and others in HE, and with European initiatives (as for example Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and European Circular Economy Stakeholder Panel (ECESP)), building on existing H2020 projects[2] is strongly encouraged, see also Industrial Symbiosis Report from March 2020.[3].

Valorise a wide variety of unsorted plastic (and other) waste in large amounts, to avoid landfill;
Yield material streams of high industrial interest, replacing the ones currently produced from fossil feedstocks (e.g. olefins, hydrogen, syngas, etc.);
Develop concepts enabling 100% utilisation of Renewable Energy Sources (e.g. electrified processes), coping with potential fluctuations in the energy supply;
At least 60% GHG emissions reductions in the overall lifecycle compared to existing processes for plastic recycling (or relevant benchmark).
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
Plastic (and other) waste, such as packaging, textiles, etc., could potentially represent a sustainable alternative to imported fossil feedstock (e.g. oil, gas). It contains high amounts of carbon, it is widely available and its valorisation could also provide environmental and societal benefits avoiding the disposal in landfill.
The proposals submitted under this topic are expected to provide concepts for utilisation of unsorted plastic (and other) waste in cracking applications, including e.g. packaging, non-sorted polymers and single use items such as PPEs, for the production of material streams of wide industrial interest (e.g. hydrocarbons, olefins, syngas, hydrogen, etc.). The technologies proposed should be electrified to work efficiently in a renewable based energy system. They should also be able to cope with potential fluctuations in energy supply.
The technologies proposed should be able to valorise a wide variety of unsorted waste, plastic could be a major source, other waste sources can be considered (e.g. textiles), providing the supply is secure and the business case is feasible. Special attention is required to the potential variability of the input, and the presence/formation of contaminants and impurities in the process;
The processes addressed can be single or multi-step (e.g. pre-treatment, grinding, etc.) and should yield material streams which are of high industrial interest and can be readily integrated in downstream industrial processes for the production of a wide range of products (e.g. plastics, chemicals, hydrogen, fuels, fibres, materials, fertilisers, etc.);
Industrial specifications should be considered, and proof that these secondary raw material streams can be used in downstream industries should be provided;
Demonstration of the improved environmental footprint of the proposed products and processes, as well as their positive impact should be provided using relevant methodologies (e.g. LCA, LCSA, etc.). The prevention of upcycling of hazardous substances and their separation and disposal should be considered;
Elements related to the replicability and scalability of the technology should be provided. Along with the relevance of the proposed approaches to solving waste related issues in existing European contexts;
Demonstration of the proposed concepts in an industrially relevant environment and at an appropriate scale are expected. The integration of the proposed technology in existing value chains and industrial realities would be an added value.
Proposals should consider the co-design of learning resources together with local and regional educational organisations for current and future generations of employees, with the possibility of integrating them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes. Learning resources should integrate the identification of new skills and should propose innovative learning-teaching methods that meet regional social needs and have a high potential for replication.

Projects outcomes will enable achieving the expected impacts of the destination by improving energy efficiency in raw materials value chains.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Demonstration of technologies in the steel sector leading to a reduction of CO2 emissions by 2050 by at least 80 to 95% compared to 1990 levels;
Improve energy and resource efficiency and increase utilisation of renewable energy sources[1] in metallurgical processes to substitute fossil fuels;
Enabling steel production through carbon direct avoidance (CDA) technologies at a demonstration scale;
Efficient integration of renewable energy sources, considering also their intermittency and the possibility to offer demand-response flexibility.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
This topic covers carbon direct avoidance technologies leading to significant CO2 emission reduction in the steel sector.
The Commission’s Strategic Vision “A Clean Planet for all” indicates that deep CO2 emissions reductions in the steel sector are possible through a combination of technological pathways, including steel recycling, carbon capture utilisation and storage, process integration, and electricity/hydrogen-based metallurgy. While energy intensity has reduced significantly over the past decades, the steel industry remains a large source of emissions due to preferred use of coal and energy needed to reduce iron oxides. With alternative pathways used with green electricity and green gases, the emissions can be further reduced so that these pathways could achieve CO2 reductions of up to 95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels.
There is no one solution to achieve low-CO2 steelmaking, as there is expected to be a variety of production technologies in the future. Relevant participation from sectors other than steel is not excluded, if the technologies presented are compatible with the expected outcomes of the topic and the Clean Steel partnership objectives.
The projects proposed are expected to address the following research and innovation areas:
Replacement of fossil carbon energy by renewable (hydro/wind/solar) electricity in iron and steelmaking;
Development of pilots and demonstrators in the field of direct reduction of iron with hydrogen. Direct reduction of iron ore with high amounts of hydrogen is expected to be key for CO2 neutral steelmaking;
Improvement of plasma melting processes with improved electrode technologies using a plasma torch or plasma smelting reduction leading to CO2 reduction compared to fossil-based fuels;
Development and testing of direct electricity based iron oxides reduction processes including the electrolytic reduction at high or low temperature;
Innovation activities focused on the process and the product properties as well as on the impact of the product properties on the downstream processes (e.g. Electric Arc Furnace). The process technology may have to be adapted to the new boundary conditions;

Reducing the environmental impact by minimizing CO2 emission up to 20% both, directly (and locally) by internal recycling of the metal fraction derived from residues, or indirectly by increasing the use of scrap as raw material in steelmaking production processes including:
the reduction of pig iron use the in the steelmaking process;
the use of alternative reducing agents as coal substitution, such as biomass, polymers, hydrogen;
the reduction of CO2 emission derived by extraction and transportation of natural resources as well as transportation and landfill of industrial waste;
the generation of CO2 neutral energy vector from chemical and sensible heat from pyro-metallurgical residue treatment processes allowing at least 5% reduction of specific energy consumption for a dedicated process.
Develop novel technologies for onsite characterization (chemical and physical) of ferrous materials to help standardization of charge managing practice;
Confirming the replicability of the demonstration plant in most of EU steel shops.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
R&I areas that needs to be tackled should address some of these aspects:
Selection and integration of best available and applicable technologies to reduce impurities in post-consumer scrap before melting together with scrap yard management supported by digital smart tools for scrap classification and charge optimization; these are key elements to increase the use of scrap achieving the same quality of the finished product in both, the EAF, and BF/BOF route and at the same time reducing CO2 emissions due to lower energy need with respect to iron-ore;
Development, deployment, and use of smart sensor and dedicated Big Data analytics to develop and further optimize decision-supported systems for helping steel plant operators to increase the process yield and to improve the final steel product quality. The projects should ensure involvement of operators and process experts in development and implementation of Big Data, ensuring the uptake of human experiences and a user-friendly processing of results;
Realisation of demonstration plants at relevant industrial scale focusing on material upgrading technologies (cleaning, size control) as well as inline characterization of ferrous materials via novel technologies for onsite characterization (chemical composition and physical properties);
Development and implementation of highly efficient technologies for recovering metals and mineral fraction from steelmaking residues, including those coming from H2-based metallurgy ones, with high metallic or oxidic fractions; two possible ways are envisioned, whereas the first one is based on cooling and mechanical steps, such as wet or dry granulation followed by phase separation; the second one relies on a direct recycling of residues in existing production processes or in dedicated pyrometallurgic melting and reduction units;
Full by-product testing and evaluation to have them covered by a standard like a CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA) or by a national technical agreement;
Enabling the use of obtained by-products in higher value applications (i.e. filtering, coating, additive manufacturing, material for CO2 sequestration, heat accumulator);
Integration of energy recovery solutions in metal recovery processes targeting at a better Return of Investment.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Significant increase of the process flexibility and demand response towards the integration of variable energy sources, i.e., renewable energy sources, including possible onsite energy storage and conversion;
Overall increased energy efficiency of the industrial process within the energy system;
New digital tools that account for the energy availability to realise the additional flexibility of the process and that create connections to energy grid platforms for a more efficient energy management system;
Cost reduction of the overall process through valorisation of excess streams into the energy system.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal
Scope:
Flexibility solutions are key to achieve a renewable energy share to deliver the EU Green Deal objectives and which goes significantly beyond the current target of 32%. In the coming years, EU industries will need to adapt to the increased fluctuations in energy supply caused by the higher penetration of variable energy sources. Besides, an integrated energy system, linking different energy carriers, infrastructures and consumption sectors in the EU, will be set to deliver climate neutrality by 2050 in a cost effective way. The increased value of flexibility will offer competitive opportunities for process industries (additional revenue streams) and enable a leaner energy system.
Process flexibility and efficient energy storage are essential to account for the variable renewable energy production. When less energy is available, process industries can consume less energy or take it from storage; whereas, when there is surplus of energy, the excess energy can be consumed or stored. A fast response rate, i.e., a swift increase or decrease of the process energy consumption, is key in the shift to dynamic operating processes. To support the change of energy supply, current processes, designed to run continuously at maximum capacity, have to be adapted. Besides, energy efficiency measures will help decreasing the overall process energy demand. To leverage the flexibility in process industries, digital process control systems that optimise the process while accounting for the value of flexibility need to be implemented.
Digital tools need to be developed to attain the energy flexibility of the process, but also to exchange data with network operators and flexibility markets (through market operators, suppliers and/or aggregators), which will enable industries to provide flexibility services. Powerful digital twins based on suitable combinations of analytical models, physics-based AI or pure AI solutions need to be designed and applied. To find optimal control solutions in a minimal time, digital twins could be empowered, for example, by multi-agent systems technologies.
Moreover, the direct integration of renewable energy generation and the higher overall efficiencies will require further flexibility solutions in process industries. Onsite energy storage or conversion in the form of electricity, heat or other energy vectors can further increase an installation’s flexibility.
Proposals should address the following aspects:
In an existing process, identification of potential flexibility that allows an efficient and competitive operation;
Redesign and modification of the process to enable more flexibility in operation (e.g. process that can run faster or slower depending on the needs of the grid) or the shift from batch processes to continuous processes, etc., including the removal or adaptation of process steps that limit the flexibility;
Redesign and modification of the process to increase its flexibility response rate (e.g., faster ramp up or ramp down) towards a higher energy efficiency at subsystem level;
Development or redesign of digital process control systems, including, e.g., digital twins with integrated multi-agent systems, etc., supported by smart sensors and integrated analytical tools, to realise the flexibility of the process and to create connections to grid integration platforms;
Evaluation of the potential use of onsite energy storage and conversion (electricity, heat, or other energy vectors) for the proposed flexible solution and integration of such energy solutions whenever relevant and feasible;
Optimisation of the new process design at pilot scale.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. Additionally, proposals should include a safety assessment and a life cycle assessment for the implementation of the developed technologies; and a contribution to standardisation, wherever possible.
Proposals should include activities that specifically target the collaboration with other European projects on energy flexibility in their work plan (for example, a dedicated work package or task).

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Increase significantly the construction and demolition waste (CDW) utilisation (at least 80% weight in line with the current waste Directive 2008/98/EC[1] as amended by Directive 2018/851[2]) by cascade approach including re-use, recycle and transformation of waste into secondary products in full cooperation between construction and waste management companies
Provide new value chain and sustainable business models for construction waste reduction mobilising cross sectorial actors;
Implement appropriate tracing of material and /or component along the new value chain.
Increase by 50% the reusability of construction products post demolition and reduce the down cycling of construction waste by facilitating modular dismantling of complex construction products;
Plan a list of actions for overcoming relevant barriers (e.g. end of waste criteria, lack of trust in secondary products, awareness of circular potential);
Develop holistic and replicable solutions for more circular and climate neutral construction materials and activities involving upstream and down-stream actors.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
Scope:
Based on volume, construction and demolition waste (CDW) is the largest waste stream in the EU. Considering that most of the waste share is glass, concrete, steel and aluminium (or other metals), the embodied energy and embodied eq. CO2 emission in the CDW is significant (8.5 MT eq. CO2 for construction in Sweden in 2015). By reusing and recycling CDW in new constructions, the sector would come closer to the targets of becoming fully circular and climate neutral. Precise quantitative and qualitative waste estimation is crucial for waste management. This could be achieved by utilising digital technologies for instance Building Information Modelling (BIM), material and component tracing, dedicated apps for construction/de-construction and optimize site management. Such tools could provide data about material type and composition (e.g. whether there are hazardous materials that require special care) and quantities, and thus an estimation of the logistics needs, cost, etc. and make waste separation easier and faster, e.g. by combining with automated equipment and robots.
Proposals should:
Develop, test and promote the necessary digital tools for material and/or component tracing and CDW management in different types of construction or demolition sites. The proposed tools should use as far as possible existing databases for waste management;
Develop automated solutions for de-construction and waste separation process;
Implement cross-sectorial holistic solutions involving glass, concrete, steel, ceramics, non-ferrous, etc. from the construction product and material side but also waste management, transportation and construction equipment and machinery side;
Produce all required training material for the proper use of the developed technologies The content should be sufficiently inclusive and encompass the diversity of different users;
Demonstrate all developed solutions (reutilisation, recycling, transformation, etc.) in at least four implementation sites across different European countries, considering the material recovery, transformation and utilisation;
Assess the value of the solutions in terms of the additional monetary value/reduction of eq. CO2 emissions produced;
Besides the new solutions benefits, safety should be considered (on construction issues, hazardous materials, etc.)
Proposals should consider the development of learning resources for the current and future generations of employees, with the possibility to integrate them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes. The projects should provide contributions to relevant standards or best practices.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved knowledge in the addressed areas, also through increasing the use of high quality data, leading to a better understanding of the processes driving climate change.
Improved projections of climate change (including in relation to climate change-related extreme events).
Improve our understanding of how innovative mitigation actions can help stabilise global temperature.
Improved understanding from these actions should be fed into improvements in Earth system models, climate services and other forms of downstream use.
Scope:
This topic aims at filling fundamental gaps in our understanding of Earth system, focussing on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and Earth system feedbacks, the behaviour of radiative forcers (including their pre-cursors), and efforts to stabilise global temperature through deployment of carbon dioxide (CO2) removal approaches.
Beneficiaries are encouraged to take advantage of the relevant national and/or European research infrastructures (e.g. ICOS, ACTRIS etc.).
Actions should improve scientific understanding in only one of the following areas:
a) Greenhouse gas fluxes and Earth system feedbacks
Actions should target a better understanding of key processes related to the life cycles of GHGs, other climate forcers and associated feedbacks affecting the Earth’s climate over different time horizons, including the effect of climate variability from inter-annual to multi-decadal and longer time scales. Actions should focus on elements of the climate system which have an important influence on climate change and its impacts but are not sufficiently understood by the latest science, such as terrestrial ecosystems, hydrological cycles, ocean circulation changes, atmosphere-ocean gas exchanges, coastal zones or the biogeochemical cycles.
b) Global warming contribution of different, non-CO2 radiative forcers
Actions should improve knowledge concerning the individual and cumulative contribution of short- and long-lived radiative forcers, including GHGs other than CO2 and their precursors, aerosols, refrigerants and other climate forcers, to climate change, including their impact on atmospheric and ocean circulation, as well as other environmental issues. Actions may focus on a subset of forcers, and should concentrate on those where the relationship between emissions, atmospheric lifecycle, climate system feedbacks, and global warming is least well understood. Actions should also assess the climate and non-climate impacts, over multiple time scales, of policies and measures targeting forcers other than CO2. Moreover, the action should examine the application of this knowledge in relevant sectors (such as transport, industry, agriculture and health) with a view to better understand co-benefits and trade-offs of mitigation policies with other societal benefits, including human health.
c) Climate and Earth system responses to climate neutrality and net negative emissions
Actions should improve understanding of the environmental consequences of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to levels consistent with the aim of stopping global warming. Actions should focus on the response of global temperatures and other key properties of the Earth system to sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to net zero and below. This should include, but not be limited to, pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement goals of limiting warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, including scenarios with and without temperature overshoot. The action should pay particular attention to climate-related challenges at different temporal scales, including potential benefits, risks and feedbacks (e.g. effects of surface albedo changes) of using carbon dioxide removal strategies, whether nature-based or technological, to stabilise global temperature. In this context, interaction with actions dedicated to carbon dioxide removal (like ongoing EU projects, NEGEM, LANDMARC and OceanNETs, as well as HORIZON-CL5-2022-D1-01-01-two-stage: Carbon Dioxide Removal approaches and Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage) is encouraged.
International cooperation on the above areas is encouraged.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improve existing European and/or global climate mitigation models by better representation of basic industrial value chains (including reliable data) and potential mitigation technologies including the impact of circular economy.
Improve the quantification of the impacts and potentials of the circular economy for climate change mitigation.
Support the integration of the circular economy into climate action, policies and their evidence base, including externalities.
Support the integration of the GHG emission reduction / mitigation in the circular economy criteria.
Scope:
Projects are to advance the understanding and modelling of the current and future potential contribution of the circular economy in Europe to GHG emissions reductions. The scope of the modelling activities has to go beyond the state-of-the-art, in particular in terms of sectors covered and their interrelations, be as comprehensive as possible (e.g. covering also the blue economy), and include citizen’s behaviours and engagement.
This action should look beyond the specific measures needed to deliver a circular economy and propose a framework for revealing, demonstrating and quantifying the circular economy’s potential contribution to climate goals, as well as improving the coverage of basic industry value and supply chains in models (or suites of models) used to analyse mitigation pathways. While focusing on the linkages between circular economy measures and climate goals, the action can also improve the understanding of the connections between climate action and other environmental areas and issues as well as social and health issues, in line with the systemic approach that the European Green Deal promotes.
Collaboration between the scientific community and policy- and decision-makers in order to integrate the circular economy into integrated assessment frameworks and other comprehensive climate policy visions is highly recommended. Actions should also ensure collaboration with industry stakeholders and civil society, including, for example, sharing best-practices, data, models and other knowledge required to analyse mitigation pathways to ensure the input of - and alignment with - the needs, values and expectations of society.
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles[1]. In particular, beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to publish results data in open access databases and/or as annexes to publications.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Ensure continuity of the ongoing interoperability of energy services related activities.
Ensure horizontal coordination and support, sustainable up-take of the energy services related to interoperability, data spaces and digital twins.
Support and disseminate a common framework for testing interoperability across running projects. Harmonise interoperability testing procedures[1].
Increased interoperability of energy services, data and platforms, both at the function and business layers.
Scope:
Facilitate the coordination and alignment of projects and support interaction between the various related initiatives happening at European and National level.
The project should support a community of practice that includes interoperability expertise relevant to the energy transition that keeps track and maintains an expertise around changes in requirements, emerging use cases and regulatory condition.
development of IT/ICT, evolution of relevant standards and all activities impacting interoperability, virtualisation and digital twins, data spaces.
industrial and working groups’ efforts towards interoperability (including ontologies, core models etc.).
Maintain an overview of what is happening, create a repository of best practices and use cases, indicate what is needed to keep this interoperability and provide a forum to support agreements on open standards, convergence on reference architectures and broad dissemination.
Increased interoperability of energy services, data and platforms, both at the function and business layers of the Smart Grid Architecture Model. Where relevant consider including also smart energy systems models going beyond Smart Grids.
Develop an Interoperability Maturity Model (IMM) to indicate the level of maturity in organisations, and the further effort/ actions need to be made to reach higher levels of interoperability.
Create a network of interested parties, and eventually, setting up a distributed European ecosystem of centres for the Interoperability testing of data driven energy solutions. This should take into account existing initiatives like living labs, digital innovation hubs, JRCs Interoperability testing lab related ERA-Net program calls and Clean Energy Transition Partnership, and should aim at supporting a European knowledge base of use cases, interoperability profiles test cases, and results of tests.
Establishing a cross-fertilisation of existing regional testing infrastructures, explore best practice of local sand-boxing and link with existing networks. Demonstrate with the testing of a set of real life cases where new interoperability requirements are to be tested, how the activities would be organised.

The partnership is expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased directionality of clean energy transition research and innovation in Europe in line with the SET Plan by a shared pan-European vision regarding the goal and direction of the required system transformation processes adapted to regional needs and availability of renewable energy resources
Evidence based energy and climate policy formulation
A wider systemic transition and energy supply required for the climate transition in all sectors of society; enabling the transition of the built environment, transport, industry and other sectors to clean, low carbon energy;
An innovation ecosystem for Europe's transition to clean energy and contribute to a resource-efficient energy system, both from an ecological and economic standpoint;
A building block to a zero-emission energy system for the decarbonisation of transport, buildings, industry, agriculture in the specific European environment;
Increased engagement of consumers and prosumers and in appropriate demand-response mechanisms and its integration in the energy system;
And finally, an energy system that meets the needs of different parts of society, in different geographical locations (urban and rural) and different groups.
Scope:
The European Green Deal aims to transform Europe into a fair and prosperous society with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy, with no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050. To decarbonise Europe, renewables must become the main energy source, while keeping the stability and resilience of the European energy system. Research and Innovation is needed to be able to achieve the Clean Energy Transition, while realizing also the ambitions of other EU policies like the New Circular Economy Strategy and the new Biodiversity Strategy and delivering on the objectives of the European Green Deal. It will also contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (in particular SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). At national level, policies and measures in clean energy research and innovation will support the achievement of the energy and climate targets, as outlined in the National Energy and Climate Plans.
The Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CETP) aims to empower the energy transition and contribute from a R&I perspective to the EU’s goal of becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. To achieve this ambitious goal, Europe needs to embark into a transformative process of both the energy system and its supporting technologies, as well as of the society. Key enabling and disruptive technologies, as well system innovation are essential for this transition. With robust investment in innovation and technology development, the energy transition turns into an opportunity for sustainable growth and competitiveness, creating high-quality jobs and leaving nobody behind.
The Clean Energy Transition partnership is expected to contribute to the overarching goal of transitioning to a clean energy system by pooling national and regional resources/funding programmes thus overcoming a fragmented approach. In its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, the Clean Energy Transition Partnership will address the following areas: Development of clean and affordable energy production and conversion technologies; development of a climate neutral, flexible and robust energy system; storage and its integration in the energy system; resource and energy efficiency and circular flows in the energy sector for an ecologically sustainable energy system; a just and inclusive energy transition; sector integration and coupling; and digital transformation.
The partnerships actions are expected to contribute to:
a better cost performance by improving efficiency, sustainability, reliability and circularity of a broad portfolio of clean energy technologies and solutions;
the integration of a wide range of new energy solutions and ‘first of a kind’ technologies on all levels of the energy system to give flexibility, promote and efficiently manage self-generation and consumption profiles and new holistic solutions for energy storage (surplus energy, peak load supply, inter-seasonal storage);
the acceleration of the sustainable energy transition and societal development by the use of opportunities arising from the digital transformation and from data and information from the Copernicus programme, as well as the European Union’s Earth Observation programme.
The partner composition is expected to at least include a geographically representative distribution of national and regional research and innovation authorities and funding agencies from EU Member States, associated countries and their regions. The number of partners and their contribution should be enough to attain a critical mass in the field. The partnership should be open to the addition of new partners during the lifetime of the partnership. The partnership should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties and in accordance to the ambition of activities proposed.
The CETP will have to overcome the transnational challenges in the clean energy transition following the ambition of the European Green Deal via a joint, shared, transnational approach, engaging a wide variety of stakeholders including industry and research institutes.
The partnership has to provide a platform that makes research results available for the best use and implementation for all stakeholders and to support capacity building in areas requiring specific resources and expertise. By doing this, public and private investments in clean energy technologies development and deployment can be leveraged and capitalised to ensure adequate exploitation of results across Europe as needed.
Based on priorities identified in the Clean Energy Transition Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, proposals should pool together the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing annual joint calls for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding. National efforts should reflect the ambitions outlined in the National Energy and Climate Plans, including on Member States/Associated Countries participation in the SET Plan work streams. Participation of legal entities from international partner countries and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A is encouraged in the joint calls.
The partnership should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues. To this end, proposals should provide for a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly. The partnership should also present and implement a joint programme of activities focussed on communication (participation in joint meetings and communication events), dissemination and exploitation.
The partnership is expected to collaborate closely with the following European Partnerships:
Clean Hydrogen, Built Environment and construction, European industrial battery value Chain and Driving Urban Transition within the Cluster Climate, Energy and mobility;
Smart Networks and services, Clean Steel –Low carbon steelmaking, Carbon Neutral and Circular Industry and Geological Services for Europe within the Cluster Digital, Industry and Space;
Circular Bio-based Europe within the cluster Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment;
And the Climate-KIC and InnoEnergy EITs;
in order to ensure coherence and complementarity of activities. Applicants are expected to describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.
It is expected that the partnership will organise joint calls on an annual base from 2022 to 2027 and will consider ample time for the implementation of the co-funded projects.
The Commission envisages to include a new action in future work programme(s) to award a grant to identified beneficiaries with the aim of continuing to provide support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.
Specific Topic Conditions:
The total indicative budget for the co-funded European Partnership is EUR 210 million, committed in annual instalments over multiple years (EUR 35 million from the 2021 budget and EUR 35 million from the 2022 budget).

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Comprehensive analysis of all demonstrated CCAM use cases and harmonised approaches for implementing future large-scale demonstrations in Europe.
Common framework for large-scale demonstration pilots in Europe including the identification of common use cases and Operational Design Domains (ODDs) as well as the definition of a common taxonomy and tools for scenario assessment.
EU CCAM common evaluation methodology building on the outcome and recommendations from Working Group 2 of the CCAM Platform.
Test data exchange framework with a collection of best practices and guidelines, including specifications for data labelling (e.g. ODD definition) and common data formats (aligned with ongoing standardisation activities) as well as tools and documentation to use them, a common openly accessible platform safeguarding ethical usage of test data in a transparent manner to improve cooperation across projects and stakeholders.
Harmonised conditions and processes for tests of CCAM systems on public roads, including criteria for a mutual recognition of procedures (building on the outcome and recommendations from Working Group 4 of the CCAM Platform).
Common basis for CCAM Knowledge in Europe through an up-to-date and continuously maintained Knowledge Base on CCAM adapted to the needs of the potential members of the European Partnership on CCAM and all relevant stakeholders.
Efficient and sustainable governance structure for the collection of CCAM Knowledge in Europe and globally, thus facilitating the engagement and contribution of stakeholders from all sectors and in particular exchanges and cooperation with and amongst EU Member States/Associated Countries.
Network and forum of experts in the different thematic fields of R&I on CCAM with adequate tools and processes to enable the exchange of experiences and practices, stimulate collaboration and cooperation between all CCAM stakeholders and reach consensus on challenges and future R&I needs.
Scope:
Many diverse CCAM related R&I activities, tests and large-scale demonstration projects are ongoing across Europe and coordination, knowledge and data exchange as well as harmonised approaches for implementing future large-scale demonstrations in Europe are needed to better exploit synergies between all these activities.
There is a need for a common and searchable baseline of CCAM, thus ensuring transferability of knowledge for future research, development and testing of CCAM.
The aim of this action is twofold:
to improve the coordination of CCAM demonstrations in Europe by developing a European framework for testing on public roads including common approaches for evaluation and test data exchange for large-scale demonstration pilots in Europe.
to expand, maintain and update the existing EU-wide Knowledge which should centralise information about stakeholders, CCAM related R&I programmes and projects in Europe and beyond.
Proposed actions must address Area A and Area B.
Area A: Framework for coordination of CCAM demonstrations in Europe
The numerous CCAM demonstration projects in Europe lack a common vocabulary and the impact assessments of these projects are often difficult to compare. If different methodologies lead to incompatible evaluations, it will be hard to get an overall picture on the socio-economic and environmental impacts across several activities.
Proposed actions should establish a well-structured overview of European evaluation methodologies and its testing instances (test sites, living labs, simulations, open road) and develop a common evaluation framework and methodology with common indicators for large-scale demonstration pilots. This will allow comparability of results, complementing evaluations and meta-analysis over multiple evaluation studies. It will thus allow maximizing the profits and ease spreading of the lessons learned across Europe. It will enable to assess the wider impacts of future CCAM systems and services, providing necessary input for decision and policy making by governments and industry. Links should be established with other initiatives developing methodologies and indicators for CCAM solutions in specific areas, in particular on societal aspects[1].
Actions should build on the outcome of the CCAM Platform WG2[2] and on the methodologies and practices developed by past and ongoing R&I activities and gathered in the CCAM Knowledge Base[3] to establish common criteria for the preparation, execution and evaluation of all types of impacts of large-scale CCAM demonstrations in Europe, in particular common assessment indicators and methodologies.
Different parties involved in CCAM testing generate large amounts of test data (from in-vehicle or infrastructure). Actions should develop a test data exchange framework, which addresses legal and administrative aspects as well as technical aspects like data provision, access, protection of user data, and labelling of data and proper description of the data format. This latter includes describing objects, features and other road users around the vehicle, but also the driver and passenger whereabouts inside the cabin, efficient (semi)-automatic annotation processes and complex-label description in a large-scale data environment. As part of the labelling, a standardised and structured annotation model should be included.
Different national policy and legal frameworks make the organisation of cross-border testing difficult. To facilitate the development of both cross border testing and support authorities and in particular cities in organising piloting projects, a European framework for testing on public roads based on criteria for mutual recognition of procedures should be established. Proposed actions should establish links with UNECE and have very close cooperation with the EU Member States and Associated Countries through the CCAM Member States Advisory Board, in particular regarding testing conditions and regulations and associated harmonisation aspects.
Area B: EU-wide Knowledge Base
Proposed actions should continue and extend the existing EU-wide Knowledge Base[4] on CCAM as the “one-stop shop” for the exchange of knowledge and experiences on CCAM in Europe and beyond and to promote existing and valuable datasets. The Knowledge Base should collect structured, up-to-date and targeted information on European and national large and small scale demonstration projects and testing activities, test sites, corridors and living labs with their features and capabilities, standards, testing and assessment methodologies as well as regulations, policies and programmes in the field of CCAM in Europe and worldwide.
It should provide a common and searchable basis of CCAM, thus ensuring transferability of knowledge for future research, development and testing of CCAM. A wider engagement of the stakeholder community in providing content and actively contributing to its future development needs to be ensured.
The Knowledge Base should also function as the key information tool of the future European Partnership on CCAM to support the development and updates of the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA).
Particular emphasis should be placed on:
Extending the content about CCAM activities in Europe and globally and ensuring it is up-to-date and mapped.
Developing knowledge summaries and collecting background information about purposes and drivers behind testing and piloting activities, lessons learned, best practices, implementation guidelines enabling the translation towards actions and agendas by authorities, decision makers and the CCAM Partnership.
Structuring information and adding specific information, in particular according to stakeholder’s needs and priorities and developing targeted toolkits to support new stakeholders in setting up, running and assessing testing and piloting initiatives.
Collecting common terminologies, methodologies, standards and procedures related to CCAM and promoting the implementation of common metadata frameworks and the FAIR data principles[5] to support interoperability.
Maximize the outreach of the Knowledge Base through newsletters, dedicated social media channels.
In close cooperation with the future European Partnership on CCAM, proposed actions should establish a network of experts in different thematic fields of R&I on CCAM. Actions should provide a forum to facilitate the interaction of experts, the exchange of experiences, implemented technologies and solutions and practices, stimulate collaboration and cooperation between all parties involved in the CCAM European partnership and beyond. Actions should organise conferences and workshops on CCAM, in cooperation with the future European Partnership on CCAM.
Particular attention should also be given to international cooperation activities to stimulate the exchange and collaboration with partners from other regions of the world on common R&I challenges in the area of CCAM. It is important to establish close contacts with the CCAM Member States Advisory Board to ensure good support for feeding the Knowledge Base with up-to-date information.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
More efficient, effective and sustainable management of goods and freight flows in (air)ports and inland terminals, taking into account all costs (economic, social and environmental) of the proposed solutions/innovations, including externalities and possible rebound effects.
Expanded throughput of the nodes thanks to increased operational efficiency and optimised use of assets and infrastructures, without expanding the physical facilities.
Improved access to transhipment services at reduced costs.
More visible and standardised services provided within the multimodal freight transport nodes, seamlessly accessible by end users to maintain continuous door-to-door tracking of freight locations and boost shifting cargo to more efficient and sustainable transport modes.
Increased automation, digitalisation, standardisation and interoperability of processes, technologies and equipment, particularly intermodal transport units (ITUs) and cargo transport/transhipment procedures in multimodal freight transport nodes.
Better integration of the various freight transport nodes into overall logistic chains.
Scope:
To achieve competitive sustainability and higher levels of efficiency taking account of all costs and externalities and to maximise the utilisation of the multimodal freight transport nodes’ capacity, the proposals should research and demonstrate all of the following points:
Building on previous EU and other funded projects[1], and enabling compatibility with legacy systems, demonstrate and quantify the benefits of using different intermodal transport units (ITUs) and innovative automated loading systems to support multimodal logistics operations. Further develop standardisation strategies on intermodal transport units also focusing on different modes and logistics operators, cargo transport/transhipment procedures, technologies and interfaces to enable flexibility, efficiency and sustainability of the transport system.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation on standardisation of ITUs is encouraged.
Building on previous and on-going Horizon 2020 and CEF funded projects[2] and the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum’s findings[3], deploy and demonstrate advanced cooperative logistics IT solutions in actual operational environment (minimum at TRL 7) focusing on better integration of the nodes in overall supply chains and the accessibility and usability of node services in an automated/digital manner, with a user perspective approach. The deployed IT solutions should:
Provide full visibility of the standard services offered by the multimodal freight transport nodes, and by the companies operating in them, e.g. open and shared warehouses, terminal services, transhipment facilities, transport services from and to the terminals;
Providing better estimated and actual times of arrival and of departure through real time track and trace of the transport and goods, benefitting from standardised identification (e.g. RFID, new sensors) and improved positioning accuracy based on European GNSS;
Provide automated decision support system functionalities to optimise the supply chain overall performance and its resilience against disruptive events (including pandemics);
Ensure compatibility of deployed solutions with existing legacy systems;
Ensure the resilience of data and management systems to mitigate the consequence of accidental or malicious interventions;
Address data ownership, confidentiality, governance and access rights;
Facilitate greenhouse gas emissions reduction through, for example, smart scheduling and routing on expected arrivals times to nodes/terminals supporting slower approaching speeds.
Capitalising on previous Horizon 2020 projects[4], demonstrate the effectiveness of new business models and collaborative approaches - preferably supported by the IT infrastructure and solutions outlined above - able to support cooperative logistics operations with focus on the provision of open logistics nodal services. The business models should consider the legal constraints and include appropriate frameworks for contractual relations in collaborative environments. Based on the deployment of these new business models, identify concrete legal barriers and regulations at both European and national levels preventing their adoption and market uptake, and propose solutions and specific policy recommendations.
Ensure compatibility with existing and emerging EU logistics standards such as the European Maritime Single Window environment[5] for maritime transport and the platforms for Electronic Freight Transport information[6] and with the outcomes of initiatives such as the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF).
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
For Area A:
Common understanding of requirements and minimum set of infrastructure adaptations for the physical and digital infrastructure for CCAM systems and services, in mixed traffic with conventional vehicles and other road users and modes of transport.
Description and development of service architectures of PDI for CCAM systems and services and agreed classification of infrastructure support levels stimulating EU-wide/global harmonisation for classification of infrastructure support.
PDI support concepts of proven maturity (technically, functionally, etc.), developed in cooperation with road users and vehicle manufacturers to extend their Operational Design Domains (ODD), and ready for large-scale demonstration actions.
For Area B:
Connectivity and cooperation enablers and needs for higher levels of automation identified and assessed, based on a detailed use-case-approach for the CCAM mobility system.
Requirements for availability (e.g. coverage, security) and performance of connectivity and cooperation enablers (e.g. data rates, latency, robustness and redundancy, quality of service, resilience against cyberattacks) specified per use case, meeting requirements of functional safety and safety-critical applications.
Ensured quality of and trust in external data by common definitions (incl. quality indicators definition) meeting requirements of cross-border interoperability and continuity.
Feasible and sustainable concepts for and provision of road infrastructure coverage (short- and long-range connectivity along the road network) developed to enable CCAM services, included in testing at living labs and ready for large scale demonstration.
Scope:
Physical and Digital Infrastructure (PDI), connectivity as well as cooperative information and action represent important resources which enable and support the integration of vehicles in the entire transport system. Road authorities and operators can provide essential PDI information to vehicles, road users and other modes of transport. As a complement, connectivity and cooperation are important capabilities of the full range of V2X actors (vehicles, infrastructures, vulnerable road users etc.). This is a necessary condition to proceed towards CCAM services in a developing CCAM ecosystem (involving benefits for e.g. road and mobility users, manufacturers across sectors, traffic management actors).
Actions are expected to address the activities either under area A) Physical and Digital Infrastructure (PDI) supporting CCAM or under area B) Connectivity and cooperation as enablers for CCAM and advanced traffic management while taking into account the complementing nature of both areas.
Area A: Physical and Digital Infrastructure (PDI) supporting CCAM
The Physical and Digital Infrastructure (PDI) is pivotal to improve CCAM services. The physical elements of infrastructure include markings, road signs, layout, etc., while the digital components encompass digitised spatial network including relevant traffic rules and regulations, input from road-side sensors, HD maps integrating static and dynamic data, etc. PDI support will particularly help in more challenging geographical or weather conditions, and can mitigate failure situations or gaps in the Operational Design Domain (ODD).
Research results so far have shown that the definition of ODD and infrastructure support level requirements serve as common basis of physical and digital infrastructure attributes in different Operational Environments (e.g. highly complex urban, interurban and motorway, peri-urban, dense traffic). Proposals are expected to develop a service architecture built upon this basis, which improves the functionality of highly automated vehicles by supporting their “sense, plan and act” ability. This service architecture will provide PDI support, which offers a finer gradation of dynamic traffic management regulations and can further increase the functional safety and the traffic efficiency – or more general, the performance – of CCAM services. Secure and trustworthy interaction between vehicles, infrastructure, and third-party services needs to be ensured, as well as addressing the aspect of maintenance/evolution for both types of infrastructure.
Proposed actions should build upon recent work of the CCAM Platform on classifying PDI elements[1] and develop a comprehensive classification scheme that also allows for describing the PDI support (and the regular update) on road network sections (what, where, when).
R&I actions should advance the technological readiness of PDI support (e.g. Proof-of-Concept) to level 6/7 on the way towards (pre-) deployment as an important contribution to large-scale demonstration actions.
Recurring technology and process innovation however bears the risk that investment, especially in sectors with long cycles, are devalued well before their (end of) lifetime. It is crucial to balance premature action versus deferral of decision making and proposed actions should therefore analyse the risks, benefits and required investments in PDI support and provide guidance towards minimum adaptations of PDI that provide a substantial and sustainable added value to CCAM.
Proposals should take into account that EU-wide/global harmonisation is key in this R&I action, enabling broad uptake of services in the common single market and paving the way towards coordinated deployment of necessary infrastructure support for CCAM. Potential needs for standardisation or input for future regulatory action should be developed.
Area B: Connectivity and cooperation as enablers for CCAM and advanced traffic management
CCAM systems and services as well as advanced traffic management use connectivity and cooperation for e.g. exchanging information on status and intentions, realising collective perception, planning cooperative manoeuvres on roads, negotiating slots (time, space) for executing manoeuvres. The first generation of C-ITS services (Day 1 services), limited to provide status information, represents a prominent example of grown technological readiness that have recently made their way into deployment in vehicles and the road infrastructure. The next wave of services, also taking advantage of emerging technologies, should enable connected cooperative automated mobility. Proposals have to build upon or further progress already deployed services, first concepts and message designs for next generation C-ITS services, as developed in C-ROADS, as well as insight from ongoing 5G Corridors for Connected and Automated Mobility. Proposed actions should address and sufficiently test all the following aspects in real traffic conditions:
Data provision through communication channels from external sources (e.g. road status, traffic and weather conditions from vehicle external sources) increasing the functionality of CCAM services and traffic management as well as road safety, traffic efficiency and environmental protection.
Ensuring interoperability and continuity of services, backwards compatibility of proposed solutions, supporting a mixed use or range of technologies (hybrid communication) while ensuring privacy and security for all, in all communication channels.
Because of the enabling nature of connectivity and cooperation as well as cross-sector links, proposed research has to contribute to an integrated collaborative perspective of CCAM. Proposals should include in research and testing all relevant actors across sectors to co-design CCAM services. Proposals should also embrace the necessity to come up with concepts for a sustainable organisation of the necessary co-investment, co-management and joint implementation of CCAM.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is advised for all projects of this topic, in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Australia.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Safe and secure operation of CCAM vehicles and mobility systems and services, enhancing trust and end user adoption of CCAM solutions.
Cybersecurity requirements including data security and access control enabling harmonised approaches and tools for data sharing.
Improved understanding of the new, emerging and specific CCAM related cyber security and resilience challenges, by using the contextual definition, including sector specific security features.
Inclusion of cybersecurity and resilience as an integral part into the development process of CCAM solutions by OEMs, Tiers, telecom providers and service providers, with common aims and objectives, frameworks/architectures and designs.
Cybersecure data sharing approaches from pilot applications towards CCAM on a harmonised larger scale.
Scope:
Safe and secure operation of vehicles and mobility systems is key to the further deployment of CCAM enabled mobility solutions, also to establish trust and acceptance amongst end users. Extending the system domains beyond the vehicle through connectivity (short range or networked) makes cybersecurity a fundamental building block for trusted (digital) interaction of road users with each other, the infrastructure and cloud-based solutions/services. Systems for CCAM need to be fail-operational and cyber-secure in their entire Operational Design Domains (ODD) guaranteeing a safe and secure operation of vehicles -independent of the respective security level the element or system has within its ODD.
Cybersecurity needs to be an integral part of the development process, with common aims and objectives, frameworks/architectures, and designs (including normal operation, decision making and actuation as well as anomaly detection).
Proposed R&I actions are expected to develop and validate methods and tools strengthening the security of CCAM solutions (vehicles, infrastructure, etc.). They involve specific security building blocks, which are ready-to-use in CCAM applications in vehicles, infrastructure with feasible communication protocols. As a system’s approach integrating vehicles, infrastructure, back-offices and mobility service centres is required, proposed actions are expected to develop harmonised interfaces and protocols.
Further R&I actions have to address continuous assessment of the robustness and resilience of CCAM enabled mobility solutions versus cyber-attacks, malfunction, misuse or system failure of the systems in use.
Actions should consider the security value chain at each level – from vehicle parts up to the transport infrastructure including the related services (e.g. maintenance, mobility) and protecting the user’s privacy and guaranteeing data integrity and authenticity. Actions should propose easy to use and re-use of best practices in cybersecurity for CCAM (i.e. architecture, design and implementation patterns).
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is advised, in particular with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Australia.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Ensure navigability for inland waterways by assuring at least 50% capacity during extreme weather events.
Enhance land/sea/infrastructure resilience to extreme weather and human caused events by assuring at least 80% capacity at network level during the disruptions.
Contribute with at least a 20% increase in modal shift to the sustainability of transport systems.
Ensure resilience and smooth functioning of passenger mobility as well as freight transport and logistics networks operating on these infrastructures.
Increase the use of recycled materials within or across transport modes by at least 30%.
Reduce environmental impact (emissions, soil/water pollution, degradation of ecosystems and fragmentation of habitats) during construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure in line with the EU environmental legislation.
Scope:
Transport infrastructure is vulnerable to climate change and other natural or human caused disruptions. Maintaining an elevated infrastructure reliability and performance is crucial for increasing the resilience of the transport system. For example, low or excessive precipitations and extreme temperatures put a strain on transport infrastructure, lowering its performance and capacity, exacerbating its vulnerabilities and raising safety concerns. At the same time when focusing at a resilient and performing transport infrastructure its environmental footprint, resource and material consumption and habitat fragmentation and biodiversity degradation should be reduced to a minimum. The goal is smart, green, sustainable, climate-resilient and biodiversity friendly infrastructure.
Research is needed in order to limit transport infrastructure vulnerability to climate change and other natural or human caused disruptions. Making infrastructures more resilient to climate change should focus on improving the ability of the transport infrastructure network to withstand disruption, adapt to changing conditions under extreme circumstances while maintaining its performance. The goal is to strengthen infrastructure reliability, improve its performance and increase the resilience of the whole transport system, creating a climate resilient infrastructure system. The proposals will develop and validate new solutions to increase efficiency, inter-modality, resilience, safety and security of the transport system, for passengers and freight. Proposals should address all of the following aspects with particular attention to inland waterways:
Solutions for ensuring the performance of inland waterways during periods of low or high water levels (as they are primary reasons blocking smooth functioning of this type of transport infrastructures).
Solutions for ensuring the performance and safety of land transport infrastructure and ports during extreme weather and man-made events. Development of strategies for increasing the capacity of resilient infrastructures during disruptive events. Interconnection of infrastructure health monitoring, traffic management and emergency management systems to support informed decision making during and after these events, also supporting possible redistribution of passenger and freight flows to complementary infrastructures.
Building on state-of-the-art solutions for surveillance and prediction of climate change effects, and identification of infrastructure points vulnerable to climate change, proposals should develop cross-modal strategies to upgrade (including physical upgrade) existing infrastructures and reduce their vulnerability, while using sustainable materials and construction techniques.
Design of standard, modular infrastructure elements for rapid deployment after disruptive events in order to increase the capacity of the transport network or create new provisional links as a temporary measure until the transport network recovers its normal capacity. Both mode-specific and multi-modal solutions can be considered.
Development of new governance models that enable cooperation across institutional, modal and national boundaries. Together with stakeholders and end users at various levels, develop and demonstrate innovative concepts and solutions to make operations for passenger mobility, freight transport and logistics supply chains more resilient to large-scale shocks and disruptions by enhanced planning, management and flow redistribution (considering also shifting to less carbon-intensive transport modes). Development of standard models and procedures to foster the implementation of resilient methodologies from design and construction and throughout the life-cycle of the infrastructure.
Innovative infrastructure solutions should contribute to lowering the environmental footprint, resources and material consumption. Exploring Nature-based solutions (NBS) is an opportunity for creating sustainable, climate-resilient EU transport infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, while producing substantial social, economic, and environmental co-benefits. The goal is smart, green, sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure, planned in a way that maximises positive impact on economic growth and minimises the negative impact on the environment and, significant and lasting degradation of ecosystems and fragmentation of habitats, promoting environmentally friendly modes of transport and leading to the reduction of transport emissions.
Proposals need to include at least two pilot demonstrations in operational environment (minimum at TRL7) in CEF corridors, one specific for inland waterways and a second one for integrated with waterways hinterland infrastructure. Proposals should also consider results from previous calls on infrastructure resilience[1] and sustainable construction and should uptake relevant EU guidance on development and management of EU transport infrastructures and be compatible with EU environmental legislation[2].

In support of the implementation of the Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy, and in order to better understand biodiversity decline, its main direct drivers and their interrelations, successful proposals will contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: Closure of the gap in the knowledge and exploration of marine and coastal biodiversity at the level of species, the intraspecific/genetic level, ecosystems, functionalities, trophic-interactions and interconnections across temporal and spatial scales;
New theoretical frameworks for the organisation of marine biotic communities, with key species, from microbiome to megafauna, from benthic to pelagic, especially invertebrates and apex predators, and considering sex segregation determined by environmental parameters, in space and time and the ecosystem processes linking them (energy and biogeochemical cycles, including the role of migratory species behaviour ), from deep sea to coastal biotopes including intertidal areas
Ocean health prediction (including climate change vulnerability), decision-making and policy implementation supported by the full integration of ecological components with physical and geochemical components (in four dimensions: surface, water columns, seafloor, time) into improved global and regional high-resolution models of ecosystems conditions and dynamics;
Improved detection and monitoring of invasive alien species, assessment of their impact on biodiversity and conservation monitoring of endangered species;
Natural capital accounting with an estimation of the value and co-benefits of services from healthy deep sea to coastal ecosystems, including non-financial benefits such as well-being and social and cultural values for policy and decision-making; development of a common EU methodology and criteria for the non-financial ecosystem benefits;
Improved science-based maritime spatial planning and identification of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas and design of Marine Protected Areas.
Scope:
Studies estimate there may be 0.7 to 1.0 million eukaryotic marine species, of which about only 226,000 are described. The EEA State of Nature Report 2013-2018 found a general lack of marine species data that hampers the elaboration of conservation and restoration measures, the sustainable management of ecosystems and, therefore, the achievement of favourable conservation status. For instance, invertebrates supporting the lower level of the food chain or marine mammals are among those species with the highest proportion of unknown assessments (over 78 %). In the deep sea, over 90% of the species may be new to science. Additionally, very little is known about the effects of modern biogenic structures related to feeding types and morphological traits that may play a major role in biogeochemical cycles. Marine biodiversity hotspots in tropical and subtropical shallow areas host species and processes that are yet undescribed. The lack of biodiversity knowledge and appropriate monitoring are critical limiting factors in the definition and implementation of measures, where the range, population size and suitable habitat area are unknown in the majority of Member States and for the majority of vulnerable marine species and ecosystems. The main reasons are the limited access and high cost of explorations of the diversity of biotopes in the vast marine and coastal realm, in particular the deep sea, and the resources available to identify organisms across the full range of sizes (from microorganisms to megafauna).
Acidification, deoxygenation, global warming and climate change, including seasonal patterns, are affecting marine ecosystems faster than terrestrial ecosystems, with their cumulative and long term effects amplifying the unprecedented pressures of the rapidly evolving ocean economy, driven by human needs for food, energy, transportation and recreation, as underlined by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES GA, 2019). The effects have been documented on mobile and habitat building species over the past two decades and reveal an accelerating trend (IPBES GA, IPCC 2019). Many marine species are highly mobile, often migratory and rely on a number of different habitats throughout their developmental stages. In addition, the marine realm hosts numerous species for which sex determination is dependent upon environmental conditions such as temperature, seasonal patterns, and other geochemical parameters. For these species, environmental changes may cause different responses and effects on species populations and related ecosystems functions that are not shown when studying the species indiscriminately of sex and population dynamics.
With so much still unknown, ecosystem processes cannot be fully understood. This weakens models of marine ecosystems and their responses to pressures and diminishes our capacity to predict and take the best measures. Since biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate in Earth’s history, there is an urgent need to take conservation measures and develop holistic ecosystem-based management approaches, so that these ecosystems become resilient to environmental changes and are able to provide services for humankind and the planet’s life support system. For this, it is critical to improve the knowledge and understand and model marine biodiversity as soon as possible. Proposals should address all of the following aspects:
Increase understanding of the dynamics of marine biodiversity and ecosystems processes and functioning (including primary production, food webs and biogeochemical cycles) in Europe, in its outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, whose participation is encouraged, and in areas beyond national jurisdictions. Ensure that new modelling and scenario approaches integrate new and existing biodiversity data and knowledge from other EU, international and national projects and from long-term ecosystem and socio-ecological research infrastructure on species, biotopes and ecosystem processes.Genomics and taxonomic technologies for the inventory and fast identification of marine species from microbes, plankton and invertebrates to migratory species (including diadromous species), apex predators such as sharks and mammals, corals and other habitat building species, generating reference datasets from identified voucher specimens and novel methods to improve biodiversity monitoring and inventory.
Increase understanding of how input from freshwater and estuarine systems influence coastal marine communities and their ecosystem functionality.
Use acoustic and non-invasive monitoring as an integral component of any marine ecosystem exploration and assessment.
Develop methods and indicators for regular and timely integrated assessments of the state / health of marine biodiversity and its key ecosystem services, in the EU and associated countries’ marine waters (Good Environmental Status) and in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
Contribute to the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and to free and open access to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility’s biodiversity data.
Identify opportunities for cooperation with relevant projects, such as EUROPABON[1], which was awarded funding under the call ‘SC5-33-2020: Monitoring ecosystems through research, innovation and technology’, or the projects resulting from topics under the Heading ‘Understanding biodiversity decline’"" in Destination ‘Biodiversity and ecosystem services’ as well as topics from Destination ‘Fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption’ (aquaculture, fisheries), Destination ‘Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors’ (biotechnologies, microbiome), Destination ‘Land, ocean and water for climate action’ (Carbon cycle and natural processes) and Destination ‘Innovative governance, environmental observations and digital solutions in support of the Green Deal’ (environmental observation). Cooperation is also expected with the Biodiversity Partnership[2] (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and other relevant Horizon Europe missions and partnerships. Proposals should outline a plan on how they intend to collaborate with other projects selected and with the initiatives mentioned, by e.g. participating in joint activities, workshops, common communication and dissemination activities, etc. Applicants should allocate the necessary budget to cover the plan. The plan’s relevant activities will be set out and carried out in close co-operation with the relevant Commission departments, ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.
Where relevant, create links, contributing to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), the European Space Agency’s Earth Observation Programme and in particular the flagship actions on biodiversity and ocean health of the EC-ESA Joint Earth system science initiative, is expected.
Improve professional skills and competences on marine taxonomy and system thinking.
Engage in cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity[3] and other relevant existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms[4].

In support of the implementation of the Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy, successful proposals will contribute to all following expected outcomes notably to better understand biodiversity decline, its main direct drivers and their interrelations:
Policy makers and implementing authorities at national and regional level can assess and predict impacts (incl. tipping points) of multiple stressors on coastal and marine biodiversity (cf. sensitive species and habitats), ecosystems functioning and all its services (including climate change adaptation, resilience and human health)
Better management and impact assessment of invasive species, harmful algal and jellyfish blooms
Implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive by determining pressure levels that clearly equate to acceptable levels of environmental impact on the Good Environmental Status.
Ecosystem based management approaches and policy measures for activities both at sea and on land to reduce pressures to ensure Good Environmental Status and will enable the sustainability of coastal and marine ecosystems to deliver services and be resilient to rapid climate and environmental changes.
Scope:
The European Environment - State and Outlook 2020[1] (EEA, SOER) underscore the fact that the current trajectories of social and economic development are destroying the ecosystems that ultimately sustain humankind. The Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services: An EU Ecosystem assessment (Maes et al., 2020)[2] points out the knowledge gaps in marine data and highlights that the data coverage in space and time is still insufficient to provide an exhaustive assessment of the condition of marine ecosystems and their services in Europe (incl. the outermost regions and overseas territories). The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) Implementation Report (2020)[3] underlines the lagging targets and actions to reach the Good Environmental Status in European seas. Consistently with the knowledge review in the latest IPCC SROCC[4] and IPBES GA[5] reports, shifting onto sustainable pathways requires urgent rapid and large-scale reductions in human and environmental pressures, going far beyond the current reductions. Europe is not making enough progress in addressing environmental challenges, that natural capital is not yet being protected, conserved and enhanced in accordance with the ambitions of the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP[6]).
Pressures on marine and coastal biodiversity and ecosystems are increasing at a faster rate than the efforts to protect them. Adding to human direct pressures, the integrity of these ecosystems and their capacity to deliver a wide range of multiple essential services and benefits to people is already and will be further undermined by the effects of climate and environmental changes which occurs faster in the ocean (like warming, stratification, sea level rise, extreme events, pollution, eutrophication, deoxygenation, and acidification).
There are still many stressors whose negative effects are not well defined, as their effects may only appear upon interacting with others stressors, creating unknown synergies. Identifying and defining direct and indirect anthropogenic and environmental stressors and their interactions should be the first step towards correctly quantifying their effects and feeding the models (forecast).
With increasing industrial use of the ocean space, there is a growing need for the development of tools for impact monitoring.
Conceptual and numerical models are crucial tools to understand how multiple factors interact and could affect non-linear systems such as natural ecosystems. They cannot be fully substituted by observations and monitoring, but empirical data is essential to validate model results and provide levels of uncertainty.
Models but also design and use of biodiversity scenarios are important approaches to perform ‘what if’ scenarios, in order to forecast potential impacts of different management options affecting the status of stressed ecosystems under evolving environmental conditions.
In order to facilitate and speed up the development of measures and holistic ecosystem-based management approaches that promote the sustainability of coastal and marine ecosystems and enable them to deliver services and be resilient to rapid climate and environmental changes, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:
Develop a systemic approach for the integrated impact assessment of cumulative direct and indirect stressors on coastal and marine ecosystems processes and services (from benthic to pelagic systems, from food to human health) and assessment of the state of coastal and marine ecosystems “health” or condition, and resilience to cumulative pressures.
Characterise, measure, and understand the combined impact of different types of pressures or perturbations (chemicals and energy pollution, bioaccumulation, invasive species, extraction activities, river inflows and supplies of sediments and nutrients, hypoxia, pH, warming, etc.) on coastal and marine biodiversity and ecosystems condition (biotic communities, structure, biotope, and functions) from small cells to large ecosystems cells, from invertebrates to predators, and considering sex segregation of species determined by environmental parameters, in space and time including estimates of the extinction risks of species and structures, which might play key roles in the functioning of an ecosystem and in the conservation of marine biodiversity.
Increased understanding of the biological mechanisms that determine the response of organisms and ecosystems to environmental changes (including components of stability, such as resistance, resilience and recovery), as well as the limits of their response adaptation capacity (tipping points), and the implications for the management of aquatic areas, habitats and species
State of the Art Biologging technology and molecular methods, in combination with knowledge on oceanographic processes to understand the effects of agents of change on the ecology and population dynamics through different levels of marine food chains.
Rationalise and advance strategies for monitoring European populations of marine species at the top of food chains, especially those that can indicate important changes in the oceanic environment, and have life histories that make them especially susceptible to change.
Integrate existing and new biodiversity data and knowledge from multiple origins, including other EU (Horizon 2020 and previous framework Programmes), international and national research projects. Proposals should take into account all the relevant knowledge and data from the IPCC, IPBES, JRC, LIFE projects, EEA, MAES, the IUCN Guidelines and other relevant initiatives.
Develop technologies, methods and models that can quantify and forecast how cumulative anthropogenic perturbations can affect ecosystem’s sustainability, productivity and resilience against environmental stressors.
Where relevant, creating links, contributing to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), European Space Agency Earth Observation Programme and in particular the flagship actions on biodiversity and ocean health of the EC-ESA Joint Earth system science initiative, is expected.
Contribution to enhancing the overall societal and public understanding of link between marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and human health through education and training (school & adult education, citizen science platforms)
Cooperate with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity by providing and harnessing data and applying an integrated conceptual framework and with other relevant existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms[7].
Opportunities for cooperation with the Biodiversity Partnership[8] (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and other relevant Horizon Europe missions and partnerships, as well as synergies with relevant projects in Destination ‘Fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption’ (aquaculture, fisheries), Destination ‘Clean environment and zero pollution’ (pollution), ‘Land, ocean and water for climate action’ (climate) and Destination ‘Resilient, inclusive, healthy and green rural, coastal and urban communities’ (land sea connection, coastal areas) should be identified. Proposals should outline a plan on how they intend to collaborate with other projects selected and with the mentioned initiatives, by e.g. participating in joint activities, workshops, common communication and dissemination activities, etc. Applicants should allocate the necessary budget to cover the plan. Relevant activities of the plan will be set out and carried out in close co-operation with relevant Commission services, ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.

DNA-based identification systems can track biodiversity change on large geographic scales and reveal the interactions among the species in a biome. On the other hand, fully sequencing life, including, when relevant, information on symbiotic organisms, microbiomes and parasites, is expected to provide new tools for the conservation, preservation and regeneration of biodiversity, drug discovery and advanced biotechnology.
The International Barcode of Life (iBOL) consortium has set up high-throughput barcoding infrastructure to barcode all biodiversity on Earth by 2045 with the help of the international community and several new infrastructures across the world. Several EU and associated countries currently participate in the barcoding endeavour, but there is no pan-European node of iBOL as such.
Similarly, the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), initiated in 2018, aims to sequence and catalogue the genomes of all of Earth's currently described eukaryotic species over a period of 10 years. Several European groups have joined the endeavour but no European target or project has been proposed yet.
Proposals should set up one or both European hubs for iBoL and/or EBP, and leverage resources and expertise to advance in completing the barcoding and/or sequencing of European biodiversity in a smart and efficient way, taking advantage of existing networks, infrastructures and expertise. Specific groups of ecological or economic importance, or species under threat, such as pollinators, mycorrhizal fungi, invasive species or disease vectors, should be sufficiently prioritised.
Projects should sufficiently plan their barcoding effort to maximise possible applications, such as, for example: registering patterns of biodiversity across ecoregions to forecast changes in response to anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss; discovering new species; tracking invasive alien species by metabarcoding forest soil samples, freshwaters or coastal waters; revealing symbiomes and trophic chains, etc. Proposals should contribute to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 by generating the reference genomes of the representative species across the tree of life, leveraging the existing genome sequencing facilities. Sample collection standards and protocols should be developed, validated and adopted, as should engagement actions and tools to allow citizens and other non-professional-taxonomist stakeholders to participate at different stages of the activities.
Data, results and methodologies from projects funded under this topic should contribute to the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity[1], and be permanently and openly accessible in any relevant repositories. International cooperation with strategic third country partners is strongly encouraged, for example with Canada.

In support of the implementation of the Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy 2030 and the Birds and Habitats Directives, successful proposals will help to bridge taxonomic and monitoring gaps, by providing methods, data, knowledge and models on the conservation status and ecological requirements of species and habitats and help to better understand and address biodiversity decline, its main direct drivers and their interrelations.
Projects results should contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Systemic, integrated and (open-)standardised data, knowledge and models on the conservation status and ecological requirements of species and habitats, with a focus on those covered by the Birds and Habitats Directives and IUCN Red List. This will lead to better management of protected sites and species, in particular with a view to setting conservation objectives and developing appropriately designed and effective management plans
The bridging of taxonomic and monitoring gaps thanks to new enabling tools, technologies, fast identification methodologies and integrated monitoring systems across Europe on wildlife species. These will help to identify biodiversity threats, such as invasive species, emergence of disease threats, conflict situations with production animals and/or human communities, etc.
Models upscaling the results of biodiversity assessments to wider areas, based on existing datasets of environmental descriptors.
Integrative taxonomy of inventory pollinator species (bees, butterflies, moths and hoverflies), soil fauna (mites, springtails, woodlices, millipedes and earthworms) and/or other threatened species groups
Scope:
The EU biodiversity strategy contains concrete objectives to protect and restore biodiversity and to address the main pressures and threats to biodiversity. In order to achieve these objectives, basic research is needed to better understand, monitor, observe and manage biodiversity, including in protected areas. Such knowledge is also indispensable to support the protection and restoration of natural capital and ecosystems.
Better, accessible and FAIR[1] data on species, biodiversity and ecosystems will also help to ensure that biodiversity preservation is a mainstream feature of other sectors, such as agriculture, transport, energy or the bioeconomy. There is a need for systemic and standardised biodiversity data on the ground in order to build up our knowledge on the status and trends of habitats and species and ecosystems, and on the drivers of decline.
Monitoring needs to be of better quality, greater relevance and more cost-effective. This is to be achieved by, among other things, developing, testing and implementing new (long-term) approaches that make use of recent technological advances and existing data from multiple origins (e.g. observation data, remote sensing, DNA technologies, big data analysis, AI, deep learning, historical records, use of citizen science and volunteer expert data).
Projects should develop, test and implement enabling tools, technologies and fast identification methodologies to produce and integrate data, knowledge and models on the conservation status of species and habitats, with a focus on those covered by the Birds and Habitats Directives. Projects should also help to develop an integrated European biodiversity monitoring system, in collaboration with the initiatives and projects mentioned below. There needs to be a particular focus on to those species and habitats, for which knowledge gaps still exist, and on those prioritised for conservation action in line with the EU biodiversity strategy 2030, such as pollinators, sea birds, marine mammals, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, bats, mosses, lichens, wetlands, coastal and marine areas, grasslands, mires, bogs and fens, heathland and shrubs.
The biogeographical approach of the Natura 2000 network needs to be taken into account. If the proposal addresses the pollinator-related outcomes, projects should produce an inventory of pollinator species through integrative taxonomy, and bridge taxonomic gaps by developing tools (field guides, identification keys, national reference collections and checklists, European online ID platform, image recognition/apps, digitalised collections, etc.) for bees, butterflies, moths and hoverflies.
Projects should contribute their data to the Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity[2] and earmark the necessary resources for cooperation with the Centre; projects should also promote synergies with the European co-funded partnership on biodiversity[3] (HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01) and its activities. Cooperation is also expected with other relevant projects and initiatives, such as EUROPABON[4] which was awarded funding under the call ‘SC5-33-2020: Monitoring ecosystems through research, innovation and technology’, or with projects resulting from this specific call as well as other EU-funded calls. Strong collaboration and networking is expected with the future taxonomy CSA resulting from topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-02: ‘Building taxonomic research capacity near biodiversity hotspots and for protected areas by networking natural history museums and other taxonomic facilities’.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the ambitions of the Green Deal, the Digital Age and an Economy that works for people, leaving no one behind, the farm to fork strategy and the European strategy for data in particular, successful proposals will strengthen the capacities of famers, foresters and rural community through connectivity gains. They will therefore contribute to i) fostering a sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of rural areas thanks to the deployment of digital, nature-based, social and community-led innovations; ii) empowering people to act for change and get prepared to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, adapt to climate change, and turn digital and ecological transitions into increased resilience; and iii) equipping rural communities with innovative and smarter solutions that increase access to services, opportunities and adequate innovation ecosystems.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Reduce (the risk of) digital divides between different types of farms, sectors and regions.
Contribute to increase the competitiveness and social and environmental sustainability of the agricultural and forestry sectors and rural areas through innovative 5G, last-mile and edge solutions.
Facilitate decision-making, in particular for municipalities, farmers, foresters and their associations, in the selection of internet connectivity solutions under consideration of technical, economic and environmental aspects.
Increase energy efficiency through analysing and developing connectivity options and contributing to climate mitigation.
Scope:
Missing access to fast broadband still presents a development challenge to many rural and remote areas. Frequently, the investments costs appear to be too high in comparison to the final number of end users in certain regions. Sometimes only investing in the “last-mile” presents a bottleneck to the connectivity. End-user needs vary not only between communities, but also between individual businesses and households, making it more challenging to find a common solution.
5G connectivity is a prerequisite for the running of several real-time applications, including of applications in the agricultural and forestry sectors, and has thus theoretically the potential to increase the economic and environmental performance of the sectors.
Overall, a range of possibilities to establish different types of broadband access at e.g. community-, farm- or field level are available going along with different investment and running costs.
Edge technologies allow under certain conditions the processing and analysis of data in remote systems, independently from larger data centres, which are frequently far away from rural communities. Edge technologies have the potential to reduce energy consumption.[1]
Communities and businesses in rural areas considering upgrading their internet connectivity are confronted with decision-making challenges regarding the choice of technologies in which they should invest in to achieve best outcomes at system level under consideration of technical, economic, environmental and social aspects and the location-specific requirements and systemic resilience.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Assessing the socio-economic and environmental effects of innovative and existing 5G/4G/3G provision options (at regional-, community-, and farm-level) and making them feasible for non-scientists).
Developing innovative cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions to 5G-and last-mile provision in remote areas tailored to the needs of communities, farms and forestry.
Assessing the socio-economic and environmental effects of innovative and existing edge technology options (at regional-, community-, and farm-level) and making them feasible for non-scientists.
Developing innovative cost-effective and environmental friendly edge solutions tailored to the needs of communities, farms and forestry, including an energy balance at system level.
Developing innovative business models (including at systemic level and cross-sectoral approaches).
Proposals are expected to undertake a comprehensive stocktaking exercise of solutions towards 5G, last-mile and edge solutions existing in the EU and globally (including satellite-based solutions[2] and other solutions, such as drones-assisted broadband provision), and of related studies and assessments. This review may also cover connectivity solutions developed in other domains, such as expedition, emergency or military services.
The aspects of regional and/or systemic resilience and energy efficiency should be elaborated, including the contribution to climate mitigation. Different regional contexts in the EU and Associated Countries as it regards environmental framing conditions, as well as the structure of the society and economy are to be reflected. To tailor solutions to practitioners’ and citizens’ needs, proposals must implement the multi-actor approach.
Project results are to be made feasible to rural communities, farmers and foresters associations, and policy-makers. A decision-making support tool, which includes assistance in business model development, is to be provided. – Practitioner-orientation has to form a key element of the project(s).
Proposals are not expected to develop innovative technology solutions for the general use of 5G, but should reflect and build – as far as possible – on the (interim) results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe Cluster 4, the Digital Europe Programme, the Connecting Europe Facility and other research and innovation projects, to develop innovative solutions tailored to the needs of remote farming, forestry and rural communities.

A successful proposal should support the farm to fork’s strategy objective of a transition to a fair, healthy and resilient EU agriculture sector, in particular the goal of fostering EU-grown plant proteins, in line with the ‘’Report on the development of plant proteins in the EU’’[1]. Activities should support the transition to sustainable, productive, climate-neutral and resilient farming systems that minimise pressure on ecosystems, while ensuring fair economic returns for farmers and food consumption that is sustainable in terms of both health and the environment.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Identification of the most suitable regional and local transition paths for stimulating sustainable, resilient and economically viable land-based protein crop production for food and feed in the EU and Associated Countries, resulting in increased commercial production of such crops and enhanced food security in the context of protein requirements in the EU and Associated Countries;
Improved, robust evidence of the social, economic, environmental, climate and health benefits and costs of increasing land-based protein crops production;
Improved capacities of farmers to cultivate land-based protein crops through innovative advisory tools, improved and wider exchange of knowledge and best practice, adoption of sustainable crop rotation practices and collaboration with other actors in the value chain;
Stronger innovation ecosystem for land-based protein crop development in Europe through multi-stakeholder and transdisciplinary intra-regional, trans-regional and trans-national collaboration and networking.
Scope:
Land-based protein crops[2] are a source of food, feed and environmental services and have an increasingly important role to play in the transition to more sustainable farming systems that provide economic, environmental and social benefits. In view of the increase in protein demand, the sustainable diversification of protein sources in the EU and Associated Countries needs to be explored and developed. Land-based protein crops have a significant role to play in this regard. However, due to a variety of factors, their production in the EU and Associated Countries is not sufficient to cover the growing demand for plant-based proteins. It is becoming necessary to develop and ensure more sustainable and resilient supply chains, and to promote higher consumer acceptance and attractive market opportunities. Specific measures are needed to realise the potential of land-based protein crops in the EU and Associated Countries.
Proposals should build on and expand existing knowledge in order to identify the most suitable transition paths for sustainable land-based protein crop production in different pedo-climatic regions, and to develop strategies for sustainable and competitive regional protein-based crop systems and agri-food and feed chains. Proposals should cover the diversity of available and novel land-based protein crop species with a crude protein content of more than 15%, and consider conventional, agroecological and organic farming systems in all European climate/biogeographical regions. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and should ensure adequate involvement of farmers and all relevant actors in the value chain for land-based protein crops. Proposals should build on the results of relevant projects and thematic networks funded under Horizon 2020 and include a task to collaborate with the project(s) selected under the following topic in this work programme: HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-12: Filling knowledge gaps on nutritional, safety, allergenicity and environmental assessment of alternative proteins and dietary shift. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Proposals should identify the most suitable transition paths for the development of sustainable new and existing land-based protein crop farming systems and agri-food and feed chains across the EU and Associated Countries. Proposals should explore the potential for value chain development, taking into consideration opportunities, constraints and impact of different tools, instruments and policies, on different value chain actors, using case studies of existing farms, networks of farms and producer organisations. Proposals should develop and test strategies for sustainable and competitive local and regional land-based protein crop systems that result in improved production techniques, cropping system design that promote crop diversification, feed efficiency, value chain development, reduced environmental impact and improved farmers’ organisation, taking into account complementarity across regions and addressing regional imbalances. Proposals should document specific support needs (advice, knowledge and best practice sharing, etc.) for farmers seeking to cultivate protein crops in different regions, assessing the availability of specific tools and developing new, innovative ones. Building on existing tools or mechanisms where available and relevant, proposals should establish a transdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder EU and Associated Countries-wide network to facilitate trans-national and trans-regional sharing of knowledge and best practice in land-based protein supply chain management and agronomic practices, including facilitating cross-regional testing of varieties. Building on existing tools or mechanisms where available and relevant, proposals should establish regional multi-stakeholder networks for advisory services, awareness raising, the sharing of knowledge and best practice, experimentation and demonstration on land-based protein crops species that are best adapted to regional conditions. Proposals should analyse the impact of climate change on land-based protein crops in various farming systems, and their contribution towards climate resilient farming and wider environmental benefits in relation to aspects such as biodiversity, input reduction, closing nutrient cycles, increased soil organic matter and improved soil health. Proposals should develop innovative measures for improving the impact of land-based protein crop production in terms of increased (agro-)biodiversity. Proposals should develop methods and indicators to compare the climate, environmental, social and health benefits and costs of greater land-based protein crop production and its industrialisation, considering the impact of policy measures on land-use changes and implications for farmers, in different farming systems and regions. Proposals should develop indicators to take into account and compare the further industrialisation feasibility and costs of the varieties considered. A method for the systematic collection of data on land-based protein crops for economic and environmental assessment should be developed.

A successful proposal should support the farm to fork’s strategy objective of a transition to a fair, healthy and resilient European agriculture sector, in particular the goal of promoting agroecology, by improving understanding of the potential of digitalisation as an enabler of agroecology, a transformative, sustainable, healthy, resilient and inclusive approach to farming that can minimise farming pressure on ecosystems while generating fair economic returns for farmers.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Robust evidence of existing innovative digital tools and technologies that specifically support the transition to agroecology for different crops, farming systems and pedo-climatic conditions;
Improved understanding of the barriers, drivers, risks and usability aspects of digital tools that support the implementation of agroecological farming approaches for different crops and farming systems in different pedo-climatic regions;
Greater awareness among different actors of the cost-effectiveness and the economic, environmental and social performance of digital tools that support the implementation of agroecology, as well as the barriers and incentives for their uptake and deployment;
Pathways to address research and innovation (R&I) needs as regards digital tools that specifically support the transition to agroecology in the EU and Associated Countries.
Scope:
Agroecology[1] is a holistic approach that relies on and maximises the use of ecological processes to support agricultural production. By working more with nature and ecosystem services, it has the potential to increase farms’ circularity, diversification and autonomy, and drive a full transformation of farming systems and agricultural value chains, from input substitution and beyond. Agroecological farming systems therefore have great potential to enhance the sustainability performance of agriculture and agricultural value chains that contribute to the objectives of the EU farm to fork strategy. Compared to industrialised and most conventional agricultural production, agroecology brings a higher level of complexity to farming systems. Digital technologies and agricultural equipment can play a key role in improving the performance of agroecological approaches at farm and territorial level, and boosting their uptake by farmers, inter alia by supporting their decision-making on farming practices. These technologies, which include artificial intelligence, geo-spatial technology, advanced image analysis procedures, the internet of things (IoT), robotics and sensors, are available and can be applied to most farming approaches. However, agroecological farming systems are more likely to benefit from tailored digital technologies and technology portfolios that enable, for instance, ongoing monitoring of the transition of farming practices and their performance through databases of in-situ data, or support for farmers’ decision-making through the integration of the different elements of an agroecological farming system in a holistic, system-based approach. The cost-effectiveness and performance of these solutions need to be evaluated in order to ensure they contribute to the effectiveness and sustainability of agroecological systems and to farm and/or landscape management. Activities should contribute to road-mapping for the improved productivity and sustainability performance of agroecological farming systems by assessing the availability of digital, data-based solutions tailored to agroecological farming and the potential to adapt “standard” digital technologies used in agriculture to the specific requirements of agroecological approaches for farm and landscape management. Due attention should be paid to aspects relating to security in the use of data, interoperability and the extent to which farmers and other actors in the food chain accept and are able to use these solutions.
Proposals should ensure that any data produced in the course of the project comply with the FAIR principles. Proposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and ensure collaboration with projects funded under the following calls in this work programme: HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-05: Agroecological approaches for climate change mitigation, resilient agricultural production and enhanced biodiversity and HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-02-01-two-stage: Agroecological approaches for sustainable weed management.
Proposals should evaluate the need for such tools, and their implementation capacity for different crops and farming systems in different pedo-climatic zones, taking account of local natural habitat types. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector.
Proposals should document specific needs for digital technologies to support agroecological farming approaches, at farm, territorial and regional / national level. Building on existing data bases of digital technologies for agricultural production, proposals should assess the availability of tools tailored to agroecological approaches and identify gaps and needs for the adaptation of existing technologies or the development of new, innovative solutions to serve the needs of agroecological farming systems. Proposals should evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the solutions proposed, and assess their potential performance in agroecological farming systems for different crops, farming systems, biogeographical regions and pedo-climatic conditions. Proposals should analyse barriers to and incentives for the uptake and effective deployment of these tools, including analysis of cost effectiveness, risks, usability and affordability for farmers, as well as social and cultural obstacles. Based on this information, proposals should compile an open repository of available digital tools to address the specific needs of agroecological farming systems, including organic, under different pedo-climatic conditions. In collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including farmers, the private and public sector as well as consumer representatives, proposals should develop a roadmap for R&I on digital technologies to support agroecology in the EU and Associated Countries.

Farming and food production data are collected at different stages of the production process of terrestrial livestock, mostly to improve economic efficiency, disease control, food safety and quality. Few data collected on farms or during subsequent processing (e.g. in slaughterhouses or dairies) are used to monitor the welfare state of the animals and the different levels of welfare. This can be done through a combination of diverse sources of data already collected and more intensive collection through automatic systems, or routine sampling. At present, even where data are used for animal welfare purposes, they are often exploited only at individual farm level or for just a few operators. The development of algorithms to interpret the various types of data that are collected could increase their value in relation to animal welfare. This would be beneficial both at farm level and in broader contexts, e.g. among groups of operators, or at regional, national, or EU levels.
Proposals should address all of the following areas of research in terrestrial livestock:
Identification of the data and appropriate indicators that enable assessment of animal welfare on farms, during transport and at the time of slaughtering/killing;
Development of innovative ways of automatically collecting data pertaining to welfare and related sustainable farming techniques;
Standardisation of data collection for a population of operators along the supply chain;
Development of algorithms integrating heterogeneous data from a population of operators in order to evaluate the level of animal welfare within the population concerned;
Development of best practices associated with statistically meaningful improvements in animal welfare (i.e. associated with improved indicators at population level);
Evaluation of the environmental and socio-economic impacts of best practices for animal welfare, including marketability;
Development of monitoring tools and smart models to improve the scope of the data collection both quantitatively (population size) and qualitatively (quality of data collected and impacts measured); and
Development of innovative ways to estimate the impact of past detrimental conditions on welfare.
The choice of the population of operators should take into account their economic and social relevance for the EU policy and regulatory framework, and potential animal welfare issues (to be addressed both quantitatively and qualitatively). The choice of data studied should take into account complementarity, frequency and ease of collection (automation or routine sampling). It should also take account of the various dimensions of animal welfare (feed and water, comfort, health, behaviour, etc.). Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector, the veterinary profession, agricultural advisory services and other relevant actors along the food chain."

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the farm to fork strategy, for a transition to fair, healthy and resilient livestock production systems, including the reduction of anti-microbial usage, a successful proposal will support research and innovation (R&I) to help policy makers and economic operators reduce the burden of infectious animal diseases, thus contributing to a sustainable livestock industry and public health (food safety, zoonoses, anti-microbial resistance).
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Enhanced capacity to prevent or control relevant priority diseases, through the provision of innovative tools and products to policymakers, the veterinary profession and business operators; and
Increased knowledge of virulence factors, mechanisms of infection and protection and identification of protective antigens needed for effective vaccine development.
Scope:
Vaccines and diagnostics are essential components of the toolbox for preventing and controlling infectious animal diseases and limiting their impact, including the potential reduction of anti-microbial usage. The development or improvement of vaccines for regulated diseases may not be attractive for the pharmaceutical industry and public support may be needed because of market failure. It is important that the toolbox includes early, fast and reliable diagnostics, which may go hand in hand with vaccination (e.g. DIVA tests). New developments in science and technology (e.g. genomics, artificial intelligence) enable a fresh approach to vaccine and diagnostic development.
Proposals should address, for terrestrial livestock and relevant wildlife, improvements in vaccine technologies (e.g. adjuvants, stability and administration), products (e.g. new/improved vaccines, vaccines addressing multiple pathogens), underpinning knowledge (virulence factors, infection and protection mechanisms, protective antigens necessary for effective vaccine development) and related diagnostics, and look into the feasibility of vaccine production based on existing or novel vaccine platforms. Use of artificial intelligence to decipher target antigens is encouraged.
Diagnostics for infectious diseases in terrestrial livestock and related domains is recommended, for instance to set animal-specific clinical breakpoints for susceptibility of key veterinary pathogens for which disease-specific breakpoints are unavailable and generic breakpoints based on antimicrobial concentrations in serum are not relevant. Point-of-care and multi-pathogen diagnostic tools are particularly helpful for strengthening surveillance and capacity to respond to threats.
The choice of infectious agents / diseases should take into account their importance for EU policy and regulation, e.g. by virtue of being responsible for epizootic diseases such as African swine fever, African horse sickness, or being priority zoonotic diseases, contributing to anti-microbial resistance, or having serious socio-economic impacts more generally. Proposals may use priorities identified under OIE[1], in EU animal health law, or by the SCAR Collaborative Working Group on Animal Health and Welfare[2], Discontools[3], or the STAR-IDAZ International Research Consortium[4].
Participation of industry is highly recommended.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the farm to fork strategy and the headline ambitions of a ‘digital age’ and ‘economy that works for people’, leaving no one behind, the successful proposals will support increased traceability and transparency in food supply chains and support the implementation of sustainability schemes. They will therefore contribute to the ambition of developing sustainable, productive and climate-neutral, biodiversity-friendly, and resilient farming systems providing consumers with affordable, safe, healthy and sustainable food, minimising pressure on ecosystems, improving public health and generating fair economic returns for farmers through the exploration and development potential of the use of blockchain in the agri-food sector.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
enhanced transparency and traceability in agri-food supply chains, including “green supply chains” through blockchain technologies;
contributing to increasing competitiveness and market power of producers, including through smart contracts;
reduce transaction costs and administrative burdens in the field of agri-food management for public and private actors through blockchain technologies and dedicated tools;
capacity building in Research & Innovation (Infrastructure), in the agri-food sector and public administration for the development, assessment and application of blockchain technologies in the field of agri-food;
excellence in research and innovation in blockchain technologies in the agri-food sector in Europe through networking of actors and initiatives.
Scope:
The potential of blockchain technologies across sectors and fields of application has been widely acknowledged and is driven in private and public domains. Also in the area of agri-food, blockchain technologies have raised interest, but are not yet applied in mainstream mode. On the one hand, the area of agri-food induces special challenges to the application of blockchain technologies, such as the nature of products; on the other hand, the sector is predestinated for tracking technologies. As pointed out in the European Commission`s Green Deal, and the farm to fork strategy in particular, transparency and sustainability efforts in the food supply chain are to be increased and power between actors to be balanced. Blockchain technologies can not only support traceability ambitions, but also support the implementation of organic or other (sustainability-related) labelling schemes as well as sustainable finance and climate mitigation and/or biodiversity-friendly schemes, and smart contracts, track information for consumers, and reduce administrative burdens for the public administration
A new level of ambition is needed to tackle research and innovation (R&I) in the field of blockchain technologies in the agri-food sector, thereby generating the necessary knowledge and solutions to enhance the development and application of blockchain technologies in the agri-food sector in the private and public domain and develop the relevant capacities to foster this R&I objective in the short, medium, and long term. Experiences from the application of blockchain technologies in others sectors and areas are to be capitalised.
Activities should create an effective framework for action, which is expected to allow pooling resources, coordinating efforts and developing a coherent portfolio of R&I activities in the wider area of blockchain technologies in the field of agri-food following an integrative and de-fragmented systemic approach. This should include:
mapping and assessing existing blockchain technologies related European and international R&I activities and promoting their coordination in the field of agri-food; where relevant, initiatives and approaches developed in / for other sectors / fields of application with the potential of being transferred to the agri-food sector might be mapped as well;
assessing the extent of application of blockchain technologies in the agri-food sector in the EU and globally including the extent to which blockchain technologies meet EU and international regulatory requirements, and draw lessons learnt, benefits and shortcomings/ disadvantages;
analysing the needs for R&I on blockchain technologies in agri-food as expressed through stakeholder consultation and on-going research projects;
identifying gaps, priority areas and types of action for intervention;
proposing methodologies to monitor and review a portfolio of blockchain technologies related R&I activities in the field of agri-food.
Funded activities are expected to increase European capacities (technical, organisational) for implementing a major R&I programme on blockchain technologies in the agri-food sector. This results in:
a roadmap for R&I on blockchain technologies in the agri-food sector in Europe developed following the concept of ""co-creation"" with a wide range of stakeholders, including the private and public sector as well as consumer representatives;
improved coordination with existing activities in Europe and globally, thereby raising visibility and effectiveness of R&I funding going beyond EU-funded initiatives and including e.g. also nationally or regionally or privately supported actions;
identification of potential ""flagships"" for testing and demonstrating solutions on key actions from a producer, processor, consumer, investor and public administration perspective under consideration of experiences gained/ approaches developed in other sectors;
informed development of policies, supported development of relevant policies, and facilitated harmonisation and coordination between decision-making levels.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
development of innovative, cost-effective and resource-efficient blockchain-based approaches (including systemic approaches) to increase the traceability of agricultural products taking local, regional, national, European and global supply chains as reference point considering private and open blockchain networks.
development of innovative approaches reflecting on the environmental, socio-economic and practicability implications of the application of different blockchain approaches considering at least the situation in the EU and developing countries.
giving special attention to the capacities of (small) farmers and processors and actors in third countries in the deployment of blockchain technologies, as well as to private and public (sustainability-related) labelling schemes, organic and climate- and biodiversity-friendly production, sustainable finance, food safety, food safety emergencies, detection of non-authorised substances, border controls and consumer benefits, and fraud prevention.
identification of possible new application areas for blockchain technologies in the area of agri-food; possible spill-over effects to related application fields, such as bio-based value chains.
development of innovative resource efficient approaches to reduce transaction costs and administrative burden for producers and the administration (for organic products).
development of suitable R&I programmes to deliver the knowledge, technologies and practices needed to achieve the aforementioned expected outcomes.
establishment of links to relevant actors and organisations, including to Digital Innovation Hubs, the European Blockchain Partnership and the EU Blockchain Observatory.
Proposals are expected to demonstrate how to liaise with Cluster 4 activities as regards the development of cross-sectoral technological developments of blockchain solutions and reflect on their potential for the agri-food sector, e.g. in the fields of blockchain-based Internet of Things network management, authentication and access controls methods and novel decentralised analytics.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal objectives, Common Fisheries Policy, the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, and the blue growth strategy, the successful proposal will support better fisheries management through data and technological development.
Project results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:
Advancing the digital transition for fisheries inspection and control and deliver data for fisheries science, management and monitoring in a cost-efficient way to fully achieve the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).
Delivering innovative technological solutions such as machine learning and artificial intelligence and advance sensing technologies to support biologically complex data analysis
Devise new monitoring and control strategies to stop illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) and promote sustainable fisheries in the EU and globally.
Create a new generation of jobs in the EU requiring digital and high-tech know-how applied to fisheries.
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.
Scope:
The CFP aims to ensure that fisheries are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable and provide a source of healthy food for EU citizens. The CFP adopts a cautious approach, which recognises the impact of human activity on all components of the ecosystem. It seeks to make fishing fleets more selective in what they catch, to phase out the practice of discarding unwanted fish and to fight IUU vigorously. These illegal practices deplete fish stocks, destroy marine habitats, distort competition, put honest fishers at an unjust disadvantage and weaken coastal communities, particularly in developing countries. The EU is working to close the loopholes that allow illegal operators to profit from their activities. To be successful, the EU needs to have in place a technologically advanced and effective fisheries control system. Fighting IUU requires global cooperation, namely through regional fisheries organisations, to foster synergies by adopting innovative control technologies and data standards by fishing, coastal, port and consumer states.
Despite the advances attained since its inception, important challenges remain to ensure that the CFP aims are fully met. The availability and quality of fisheries data should be improved and more needs to be done to ensure that these data are shared systematically between all relevant entities, including fisheries scientists. In the EU, current control measures are only partially effective at ensuring the enforcement of the landing obligation, and of fully documented fisheries more generally. Accurate recording and accountability of by-catches of sensitive species, such as birds and mammals, and of marine biological resources are essential for an ecosystem approach to fisheries and for a sound stock assessment, which are in turn the foundation of responsible and sustainable fisheries management. The control and monitoring of vessels operating outside EU waters (long-distance fleet) as well as the small-scale fleet and recreational fisheries need particular attention.
Moreover, in order to ensure that EU fish imports come from sustainable fisheries and to promote the eradication of IUU worldwide it is necessary to cooperate with third-countries and international organisations to strengthen and promote the use of similar cost-efficient control technologies and data standards. The digital revolution has to contribute to ensure accurate catch registration data, including from weighing at landing, the verification of measures on fishing capacity applicable to vessels engine power, better traceability of fisheries products and improved catch certification schemes.
Digitisation and advanced tools applied to fisheries, such as Remote Electronic Monitoring Systems (REMs), artificial intelligence, machine learning tools, sensor data and high-resolution satellite imagery, have enormous potential to optimise fishing operations and enhance our ability to collect and analyse data, as well as improve monitoring and control capabilities and ultimately support a sustainable management of marine biological resources.
Research and innovation under this topic should review existing and develop new technological solutions to improve: (i) detection of illegal discards; (ii) checks on weighing, weighing systems and accurate catch registration; (iii) data management and reporting and third-party reporting based on remote electronic monitoring systems on vessels; (iv) risk management applied to fisheries; (v) monitoring and control of small-scale, recreational and long-distance fleet, (vi) electronic marking of fishing gear, (vii) identifying IUU activities as well as fisheries products stemming from those activities, (viii) promoting data standards and protection, remote access to data and automatic data exchange protocols, and (ix) innovative tools to assess compliance with technical requirements and measures applicable to fishing vessels, such as continuous engine power monitoring.
Research under this topic should be cross-disciplinary bringing together marine scientists, maritime (including fisheries) surveillance and control authorities, IT specialists and governance experts.
Where relevant, proposals may seek synergies and capitalise on the results of projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, its continuation European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams.

In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment-friendly food system, and the EU’s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I on integrated approaches throughout the food system for detecting, assessing and mitigating relevant food safety risks. It will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
reduced risks from biological and chemical hazards throughout the food system;
administrations’ ability to anticipate and mitigate emerging food safety risks, capacity and expertise for risk assessment activities including holistic risk assessment (risks in combination with benefits) and best-fitting control measures for biological and chemical hazards across the food system;
improved support for food systems regulatory science (integrated risk-benefit assessment, cost-benefit assessment) through robust holistic risk assessment;
improved use of ‘big data’ to predict and prevent emerging food related threats; and
long-term anticipation and prevention of emerging risks for food and feed safety, plant, soil and animal health, and nutritional quality through better trend tracking and characterisation systems.
Scope:
Food-borne diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and a significant impediment to socio-economic development worldwide, but the full extent and burden of unsafe food, and especially the burden arising from chemical and biological hazards, is still largely unknown[1].
Successful proposals are expected to address both of the following areas (area A and area B):
Area A
develop methods for early identification and monitoring of drivers of (re)emerging food safety risk and threats (e.g. global environmental changes, globalisation, technological innovations, policy changes, changes in values, perceptions and sensitivity, change in economic models, etc.);
develop methods and devices for the characterisation of emerging risks, with the aim of anticipating and possibly mitigating/preventing impacts (preparedness);
develop educational material/curricula to help strengthen existing food safety risk analysis teaching with an inter-/trans-disciplinary systems dimension;
engage authorities and the general public throughout Europe in early warning and the identification of emerging risks through a coordinated citizen science approach, and food safety awareness-raising efforts;
develop guidance on how to integrate food safety considerations in the design phase of innovations such as circular economy, by identifying possible emerging risks, in liaison with relevant initiatives that would benefit from the results;
develop methods to guarantee food safety in local food systems from farm to fork, in particular in small-scale businesses, and local cooperatives; and
develop holistic risk-benefit assessment methods and tools, and adapt these for use in a regulatory setting.
Area B
improve knowledge on the persistence of pathogens (including viruses) in food matrices and food processing environments for improved microbe control;
develop data, indicators and tools to address and tackle the risks associated with new and food-borne pathogens (including viruses);
develop and validate detection methods for new hazards and develop methods and devices for early identification of risks for food safety and threats;
develop more robust and responsive models for food safety crisis management, taking into account socio-economic and environmental factors;
analyse drivers of risks (globalisation, urbanisation, environmental degradation, climate change, etc.) to support the long-term anticipation and possible prevention of emerging risks; and
develop scientific evidence to support assessment of the risk posed to susceptible human subpopulations (including gender in the research context) and ecosystems and the underlying risk drivers.
Successful proposals should deliver support for evidence-based policymaking and related risk assessment activities and implementation needs, in particular for the development of effective regulatory control and enforcement aspects in the area food safety. Engagement with risk managers and risk assessors is expected for priority-setting and to deliver impactful results.
Proposals should explain how they will deliver co-benefits to the four Food 2030 priorities.
The multi-actor approach (see the eligibility conditions) must be implemented by involving a wide range of food system actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research. Proposals are encouraged to follow the One Health[2] approach and to build on past or ongoing EU-funded research and cooperation with relevant initiatives (such as the One Health’ European joint programme[3]). They should have a clear plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (if funding of more than one project is possible). They should participate in joint activities, workshops and common communication and dissemination activities. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy intensive industries should adapt their production processes and unit operations to increasingly sustainable, but highly fluctuating energy supply. To this end, energy and resource flexibility in the European process industry can be improved through the development of novel processes utilising more efficiently energy streams, heat recovery and raw materials flows with variable properties (including new or modified materials as well as secondary raw materials and by-products).
The challenge is to establish synergistic integration at a regional level among different production sectors leading to optimisation of production system as a whole and logistics, especially in terms of the supply of energy and raw materials. This should reduce emissions and environmental impact, while maintaining competitiveness and job security.
Scope:
Solutions are needed for value chain optimisation through energy efficiency considerations in the design phase of manufacturing equipment and processes, collective demand side strategies, and potential integration of the nearby renewable energy sources.
In particular, proposals are expected to develop:
Innovative production technologies allowing flexibility in terms of raw material, including new, modified or secondary raw materials, and intermediate or final products are expected to be developed. They have, at the same time, to consider quality of the main products and by-products in view of their valorisation through re-use and recycle;
Novel advanced energy systems, could include new combustion and gasification techniques applied to the highly resource and energy intensive industries have to be developed;
New developments should clearly indicate how the use of sustainable electrical energy sources, or heat recovery, could enhance energy efficiency and cope with a fluctuating energy input. These actions have to bring a significant impact on the sustainability profile of the process and/or the final products.
Proposals need to consider the following elements:
Treatment technologies and process integration solutions allowing a significant reduction as well as the valorisation, re-use and recycling of by-products and waste streams (solid, liquids and gaseous);
System, process modelling and integration (up and down-stream) within the plant operation terms or symbiosis concepts, improving energy and raw materials efficiency and flexibility, and minimising the impact on the environment of the whole value chain. Taking also into consideration optimisation at a plant/system level. The activities have to be supported by a quantitative Life Cycle Assessment.
Proposals should include multiple demonstrators, including retrofitting of industrial installations, in a highly energy and resource intensive industry-relevant environment. The whole value chain should be considered, as well as relevant regulations which support the recycling of waste materials in Europe. Exploitation of structural and regional funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies is strongly encouraged.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 8 and 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
As an exception from General Annex D, the funding rate for eligible costs in grants awarded under this topic will be differentiated: 100% of the eligible costs for beneficiaries and linked third parties that are non-profit legal entities; and 50% of the eligible costs for beneficiaries and linked third parties that are for profit legal entities.
Expected Impact:
Cost reduction of the process of at least 10% through the implementation of a flexible scheme in raw materials, including secondary raw materials, process and product quality specifications;
Improved process efficiency through re-utilisation of energy and/or material process streams by at least 15%;
CO2 emissions reduction by at least 5% and reduction of the environmental impact in terms of the main key performance indicators by at least 15%;
Effective dissemination of major innovation outcomes to the current and next generation of employees, through the development, by education/training experts, of learning resources with flexible usability. These should be ready to be easily integrated in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

the PCI has received a legally valid cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) decision pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013; or, for PCIs falling under the category set out in Annex II.1(c) of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 and that therefore do not receive a CBCA decision, the PCI shall aim to provide services across borders, bring technological innovation and ensure the safety of cross-border grid operation;
the PCI is commercially not viable according to the business plan and other assessments carried out, notably by possible investors or creditors or the national regulatory authority. The decision on incentives and its justification referred to in Article 13(2) of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 shall be taken into account when assessing the PCI’s commercial viability. The project-specific CBA and the CBCA decision should be included in the application as standalone documents as well as the business plan. The business plan should be complemented with a separate calculation model (financial spreadsheet), as per application form B.
Pursuant to Article 14(4) of of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, PCIs falling under the categories set out in Annex II.1(e) and 4 of of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, i.e. ""smart grids and crossborder carbon dioxide networks"", are also eligible for EU financial assistance in the form of grants for works, if the concerned project promoters can clearly demonstrate the significant positive externalities generated by the PCIs and their lack of commercial viability, according to the business plan and other assessments carried out, notably by possible investors or creditors or, where applicable, a national regulatory authority.
The contents of the supporting documents and whether the proposed project demonstrates evidence concerning the existence of significant positive externalities, namely security of supply, solidarity or innovation; provides services across borders, brings technological innovation and ensures the safety of cross-border grid operation; or is commercially not viable will be assessed during the evaluation under the applicable award criteria.
The proposals requesting grants for works which fail to provide the relevant supporting documents or that provide supporting documents that are not legally valid at the time of their submission or which fail to comply with any of the eligibility criteria indicated above may not be eligible.

","08 November 2016
","05 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
The European water sector has a prominent position in economy and society, but it is very diverse and fragmented. It needs to revolutionise the way public and private actors work together so as to address water-related challenges and seize on opportunities strengthening a demand-driven approach. A systemic approach, incorporating both the physical structure of the system and the rules governing the operation, performance and interactions of its components, could address those issues in an integrated manner. Such an approach should go beyond the pursuit of wastewater treatment and reduction of water use to inspire technological, organisational and social innovation through the whole value chain of water (i.e. water as a resource, as a productive input and as a waste stream), moving towards a circular economy approach.
More specifically, with an increasing global demand for food, feed and fibre, the demand for nutrients is growing. Although increasing food and biomass production necessitates a higher application of nutrients, current fertilisation practices use resources inefficiently. At the same time accumulation of nutrients is causing major environmental problems. The EU legislation is already aiming at regulating nutrient emissions to the environment but more can be done to encourage a transition to an efficient nutrient recovery and recycling. Water is the most used carrier of nutrients and, at the same time, an important resource itself. Water treatment management models and technologies have the potential to create new business opportunities for an extensive nutrient recovery and contribute to the circular economy. However, an extensive implementation of integrated nutrient recovery technologies and the use of the recovered nutrients at European level is still lacking and this is proposed to be addressed in the 2016 call for proposals.
In addition, today's water services aim mainly to save water and to improve its quality. However, water becomes more and more a scarce resource as a result of urbanisation, increased competition between various uses, economic sectors and extreme weather events. To deal effectively with these pressures, there is a need for improving water systems by considering the whole water-use production chain and by identifying solutions that enhance both the economic and environmental performance of the system. These innovative solutions should be in line with the objectives of the circular economy, contributing to the challenges of a depletion of raw materials (e.g. through the recovery of resources from waste water) and climate change (reducing energy needs or producing energy) and should be demonstrated at large scale. This is proposed to be addressed in the 2017 call for proposals.
Scope:
Proposals shall address one of the following issues:
a) Demonstrating the potential of efficient nutrient recovery from water (2016): The objective of this topic is to implement large scale demonstration projects to tap the potential of nutrient recovery and to encourage the use of these nutrients throughout Europe. Projects should cover the whole value chain from recovery of nutrients to their recycling. The demonstration may involve recovery technologies implemented in any water sector (i.e. industrial, agriculture, or municipal). Treatment schemes should be optimised to allow better recovery rates and material qualities adapted to users’ needs and capacities. A life-cycle assessment approach should be used together with environmental and health risk assessment methodologies. New business models exploiting the benefits associated with nutrient recovery and recycling should also be implemented and tested. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project. Relevant legal, societal and market challenges affecting the recycling of recovered nutrients and their market uptake should be addressed. Involvement of social sciences and humanities disciplines is deemed necessary, for instance to address issues such as attitudes to and acceptance of recycled products. Prospective end-users need to be involved in the projects, informing them about the quality and safety requirements to be met by the products derived from nutrient recovery, thus ensuring the involvement of the demand side to increase market success. Proposals should include participation of industry partners from relevant sectors, and active participation of SMEs where relevant.
This topic supports the implementation of the EIP Water, addressing several priority areas such as water and wastewater treatment, including recovery of resources, and water reuse and recyling.
Where technological innovation is concerned, TRL 5-7 should be achieved.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 million and EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Towards the next generation of water systems and services – large scale demonstration projects (2017): The objective of this topic is to demonstrate innovative solutions at a large scale (i.e regions, cities and/or river basins), in line with EIP Water priorities and the objectives of the Water Framework Directive. Proposals should focus on developing the water services of the future, going beyond water supply sustainability addressing the different water value chains. They should integrate, for instance, the management of water resources and the provision of water services, expanding the re-use of treated waste water and the use of desalinated water (where appropriate), ensuring carbon neutral water services, and closing the water cycle by increasing the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, including the recovery of energy and the re-use of chemicals and nutrients.
Projects should build on experience already gained in areas where integration of various aspects of water management and other economic and social activities is already taking place at different levels, with replication potential in other areas of Europe or at wider scale, thus demonstrating a real added-value at EU level. Successful projects should engage all relevant stakeholders, especially user communities, at an early stage in the co-creation process, bringing together technology push and application pull. This is also necessary to show the potential of using systemic eco-innovative approaches in water, to overcome related barriers and bottlenecks and to create new opportunities for jobs and growth in various regions and river basins. Participation of industry partners from relevant sectors is considered essential and the active participation of SMEs is encouraged. The application of new business models and new value chains is encouraged. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project. Where relevant, integrated environmental impact assessments and risk assessment of potential harmful substances should be considered. Relevant socio-economic issues, in particular, regulatory/governance issues, social behaviour and acceptability should also be addressed, requiring the participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines such as political sciences, economics, governance and business studies. To enhance the systemic approach and the transformation of water services toward a more circular economy approach, digital technologies and ICT tools should be also considered. Activities aiming at facilitating the market uptake of innovative solutions, including standardisation, should also be addressed.
Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, so as to achieve a more effective implementation and deployment at larger scale and scope of the innovative solutions addressed. Additional funding sources could include relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), such as under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). In these cases, contacts could be established with the funds' managing body during the duration of the projects. In case of relevance for the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies, the project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries have been pre-identified. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.
Where technological innovation is concerned, TRL 5-7 should be achieved.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For both (2016 and 2017): Within the projects funded, possible regulatory barriers should also be addressed, as appropriate. In particular 'Innovation Deals' may be proposed. By 'Innovation Deal' an innovative better regulation instrument is understood, in the form of voluntary agreements with external stakeholders to identify and overcome regulatory barriers to innovative solutions that would enable policy or legislative objectives to be better achieved.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to contribute to:
a)
decreasing the dependency on primary nutrient resources and increasing the supply security at European level;
reducing the adverse effects of nutrient emissions on the environment;
closing the water and nutrients cycles in the whole production and consumption value chain;
improving the quality of data on nutrient flows, thus providing important information for investments into the recycling of recovered nutrients;

improving the policy and market conditions in Europe and globally for large scale deployment of innovative solutions;
providing evidence-based knowledge regarding the enabling framework conditions (such as the regulatory or policy framework) that facilitate a broader transition to a circular economy in the EU.
b)
significant reduction of the current water and energy consumption at regional and/or river basin scale by closing the cycles of material, water and energy, using alternative water sources and supporting the transition towards smart water services;
interconnectivity between the water system and other economic and social sectors;
increased public involvement in water management;
increased citizen satisfaction with water services;
replication of new business models in other areas and replication of models for synergies between appropriate funding instruments at regional, national or European level;

Successful projects should engage all relevant stakeholders, especially user communities, at an early stage in the co-creation process, bringing together technology push and application pull. This is also necessary to show the potential of using systemic eco-innovative approaches in water, to overcome related barriers and bottlenecks and to create new opportunities for jobs and growth in various regions and river basins. Participation of industry partners from relevant sectors is considered essential and the active participation of SMEs is encouraged. The application of new business models and new value chains is encouraged. The proposals should include an outline business plan which can be developed further in the course of the project. Where relevant, integrated environmental impact assessments and risk assessment of potential harmful substances should be considered. Relevant socio-economic issues, in particular, regulatory/governance issues, social behaviour and acceptability should also be addressed, requiring the participation of social sciences and humanities disciplines such as political sciences, economics, governance and business studies. To enhance the systemic approach and the transformation of water services toward a more circular economy approach, digital technologies and ICT tools should be also considered. Activities aiming at facilitating the market uptake of innovative solutions, including standardisation, should also be addressed.
Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, so as to achieve a more effective implementation and deployment at larger scale and scope of the innovative solutions addressed. Additional funding sources could include relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), such as under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). In these cases, contacts could be established with the funds' managing body during the duration of the projects. In case of relevance for the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies, the project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries have been pre-identified. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.
Where technological innovation is concerned, TRL 5-7 should be achieved.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For both (2016 and 2017): Within the projects funded, possible regulatory barriers should also be addressed, as appropriate. In particular 'Innovation Deals' may be proposed. By 'Innovation Deal' an innovative better regulation instrument is understood, in the form of voluntary agreements with external stakeholders to identify and overcome regulatory barriers to innovative solutions that would enable policy or legislative objectives to be better achieved.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The objective of this action is to develop a web-based instrument that can be of use to both
national trade promotion organisations and the European Commission in order to map the
international trade promotion activities inside and outside the EU.
The envisaged tool is a real-time geographic map depicting:
- the planned destination countries of national trade promotion missions and EU Missions
for Growth;
- the participation of national delegations to major international trade fairs;
- the incoming trade missions in the EU from the main trade partners, such as US, Japan,
China, Brazil ,etc..
The action under this strand will cover the development, implementation and maintenance
of this tool for the duration of the contract. This map will be hosted on the European
Commission’s SME Internationalisation Portal. The sensitive information from this map
will be protected and open only to the countries and relevant Commission services joining
the scheme.
This tool should allow organisers of trade promotion missions to explore synergies and
become more effective by either joining forces or separating them more strategically.
Although the Commission undertook the development of such a tool, the feeding of
information will only be done on voluntary basis. However, the technical
characteristics of the tool should allow for the coverage of all EU Member States /
COSME participating countries, even though several of them will not join from the
beginning.
The consortium applying under this strand should include at least three entities from at
least 3 countries, as mentioned in point 6.2 of the Call for proposals. These entities will
co-operate in setting up the instrument. However, when launched, the instrument itself
must include data for at least 6 countries' activities and trade missions. Therefore, in its
application, the consortium must prove the support from at least 3 other countries."

Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs is a mobility scheme that allows potential or newly established entrepreneurs to spend a period of time collaborating with an experienced entrepreneur in another participating country. These mobility actions aim to help the entrepreneurs enrich their experiences as well as learn and network with entrepreneurs in other participating countries.
The aim of this call is to expand and strengthen the existing network of Intermediary Organisations which act as local contact points for newly established entrepreneurs as well as experienced entrepreneurs in the participating countries.
Scope:
The purpose of the call is to select bodies which will act as Intermediary Organisations (IOs) to implement the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme at local level. They will, in particular, recruit and assist the entrepreneurs who will benefit the programme. This call will therefore support actions for organisations enhancing and facilitating the mobility of new entrepreneurs, and is not intended for entrepreneurs willing to participate in the programme.
Proposals need to be submitted by public or private entities, in partnerships composed of at least 5 entities from at least 4 different Participating Countries. Participation of a partner in more than one proposal is excluded.
The Intermediary Organisations (IOs) will be required to cooperate with all other organisations and authorities involved in the mobility programme. They will receive support from the existing Support Office (SO), which helps with the coordination and management of the programme across Participating Countries.
Expected Impact:
The initiative expects to have achieved the following results by January 2018:
- Circa 650 exchanges matched; - Circa 2000 entrepreneurs registered; - Circa 100 Intermediary Organisations involved in the implementation of the programme; - At least 25 countries covered; - Rate of successful exchanges above 90%."

Under this objective, partnerships (concerning seniors) which facilitate the increase of tourism flows during the low and medium seasons between European Union (EU) Member States and/or non-EU countries are supported.
The specific objectives of this theme for the present call are to:
 Facilitate seniors transnational mobility within the EU, lifting obstacles alongside the tourism value chain (e.g. accessible barriers scaling up the use of innovation and technologic tools, enabling senior citizens to pursue active, healthy and more independent travel mobility);
 Reposition on and enlarging the senior market to increase investment opportunities for the tourism industry, SMEs and businesses, both at European and international level;
 Facilitate the internationalisation of tourism businesses (mainly SMEs) and senior associations and their introduction or consolidation in the senior tourism market;
 Facilitate the emergence of a better and coordinated age-friendly tourism supply along the tourism value chain, matching the specific seniors' needs and expectations;
 Improve governance in the senior tourism field, fostering the establishment of long-term public and private transnational partnerships supported at regional, national and European level.
Project proposals must target EITHER ""seniors"" OR ""young people"" and must clearly indicate which one of these two groups they target. Proposals addressing both target groups together will be rejected.

","Grant agreement
","12 May 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The objective of the action is to reinforce the competitiveness of the European SMEs active in the design-based consumer goods area. By encouraging the market uptake of new and creative solutions in the design-based consumer goods area, the action aims at multiplying the effects of foreseen solutions by mobilising a wide market uptake and reaching a critical mass and self-sufficiency during the project duration or in the short/medium term.
The measure therefore seeks to bridge the gap between research and innovation on the one hand and market on the other hand by supporting scale-up, market replication and/or first application of projects related to novel products, services, techniques or processes. By doing so, it will limit to a large extent the residual risk and will contribute to stimulating competitiveness among EU SMEs of the targeted value chains.
Scope:
Design-based consumer goods SMEs are continuously reinventing their business models by changing production and distribution patterns to match the demand expressed by consumers and capture new market trends. In order to remain competitive, these companies have to continue moving towards higher added value products, processes and services. To take advantage of demographic changes and rapidly emerging new market trends, they need market-ready and consumer-oriented solutions.
Promising solutions may already exist but often they do not reach the market due to commercialisation obstacles and residual risks linked to scaling-up. They may also result from the fragmented structure of the activities involved, constituted typically by a large number of SMEs, with difficulties to attract the necessary skills and finance (“valley of death”).
Expected Impact:
The action aims to support projects related to market uptake of creative and novel products, services, techniques or processes, which feasibility has already been demonstrated but due to existing difficulties have not yet penetrated the market. It seeks to shorten the time-to-market of innovative solutions, remove obstacles to wider application of creative solutions, create or enlarge markets for related products (or services) and finally improve the competitiveness of European companies in world markets. Moreover, there is an important potential to replicate the innovations not only in participating SMEs but also across the supply-chain while generating important spill-overs.
The call will specifically target SMEs that can participate alone or lead a consortium (including for example academia, other research and technology organisations (RTOs) and relevant support services). The methodology and performance indicators will follow best practice and mainly focus on business impact."

Objective / Scene Setter:
The aim of this call is to provide policy-makers and relevant stakeholders for credible, comparable and systematic information and indicators on the role of the family businesses in national economies and to offer usable and practical information to stakeholders for their decision making. The projects selected should also support the development of statistics for the first time in countries which have not collected yet this information. The European Commission will co-finance actions carried out by national statistical offices, or by other organisations but in cooperation, collaboration or partnership with a national (federal or regional) statistical office, for the collection of statistical data, measuring the performance of each group of family owned enterprises within the economy, the value of the goods and services produced, the employment generated, evaluation the sector in terms of its contribution to GDP, jobs, capital investment and tax revenues, its role in the balance of payment and other information.
Scope:
The expected results are the deliveries of methodological reports for collection of statistical data on family business within the national economies.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the projects will be implemented in at least 6-7 countries and that the information produced in reports will be used for further policy development. In a longer term the implementation of proposed activities should lead to improved evidence bases in the area of family businesses and to increased number of countries where such data is collected.

Objectives
The support to European Networks of Cultural and Creative Organisations action intends to enhance the capacities of European cultural and creative sectors to face common challenges and nurture talents, innovate, prosper and generate jobs and growth.
This action will support projects implemented by highly representative, multi-country, membership-based networks of European cultural organisations, which cover a wide range of Creative Europe participating countries[1]. Networks must have a shared mission, governance rules, and members' rights and obligations, as formally specified (in ""statutes"" or equivalent) and agreed upon by its members. Networks should be composed of a coordinating entity and its members.
European networks exclusively covering the audio-visual sector are not eligible for funding under this action.
Themes and priorities (scope)
In the current context, there is a need to promote fair, inclusive and diverse frameworks supporting artists and cultural and creative professionals. This includes effective mechanisms to ensure the cultural sector offers diversity, inclusion and equality for all, promotes effective ways to tackle the gender gap and related divides, and fights discrimination. From this perspective, promoting better frameworks, working conditions and remuneration for all cultural and creative professionals to thrive becomes a key strategic consideration[2], among others.
The cultural and creative sectors should also contribute to the European Green Deal, in particular by encouraging these sectors to adopt more environmentally sustainable practices. This is in line with the objective of the European Union to mainstream climate actions in all of its policies, with an overall target of 30% of the EU budget allocated to support climate objectives.
Applicants must consider these two cross-cutting issues in the design and implementation of their projects.
In addition, proposals should tackle one or several of the following specific call priorities:
increase cultural access to and participation in culture as well as audience engagement and development
With this priority, the aim is to build the capacities of the cultural and creative sectors to enhance cultural participation across Europe as well as audience engagement and development.
The New European Agenda for Culture[3] highlights that culture is an ideal means of communicating across language barriers, empowering people and facilitating social cohesion, including among refugees, migrants, and host populations. Culture is also a transformative force for community regeneration, social cohesion and public debate.
Cultural participation has been recognised as one of the main factors for individual self-development and well-being, as well as an accelerator of societal changes and of the construction of inclusive, resilient societies. Culture strengthens the social capital of societies, facilitating democratic citizenship, fostering creativity, well-being and critical thinking, encouraging integration and cohesion, and promoting diversity, equality and pluralism[4].
Symbolic, social and financial barriers to cultural participation remain, despite the efforts of cultural organisations to adapt to changing patterns of cultural consumption and population composition. New approaches using the cultural capability approach should be encouraged. This means implementing a wide range of quality cultural activities, promoting opportunities for all to take part and to create, and strengthening links between culture and education, social affairs, urban policy, research and innovation[5].
When addressing this priority, proposals shall include specific measures to reinforce the capacities of organisations and professionals from the cultural and creative sectors to increase cultural access to and participation in culture as well as audience engagement and development.
build the capacity to be active at international level in Europe and beyond
In the context of a globalised world, European cultural operators can benefit from cooperation with partners from other countries, including those outside Europe. Networks often provide the necessary support that cultural organisations and professionals need in order to be active internationally. Conversely, they can also be brokers in bringing expertise and capacities to Europe from all over the world.
When addressing this priority, proposals should build the capacity of organisations and professionals from the European cultural and creative sectors to be (more) active internationally, within and beyond the Creative Europe participating countries, and contribute to foster international cultural relations.
Proposals should encourage the scaling up of Europe’s cultural and creative sectors. They can include, for instance, activities supporting international presence, marketing and branding, or providing for the international networking of cultural organisations, the exchange of experiences with peers, the building of future cooperation leading to the implementation of local projects, or the reinforcement of ongoing cooperation. Proposals could also consider liaising with existing networks, projects or platforms operating in the areas concerned.
Proposals should reinforce the notion of global communities, and promote and enable more balanced exchanges and fairer working conditions for professionals. In this regard, they should empower artists and professionals to propose creative and valuable solutions to global challenges, and take local realities into consideration.
More background information on the internal dimension can be found in the following EU documents:
the elements on the “external dimension (Strengthening international cultural relations)” that are included in the New European Agenda for Culture[3]
the Joint EEAS/Commission Communication ""Towards an EU strategy for international cultural relations""[7]
the Commission Communication “Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe”[8]
contribute to the European Green Deal
With this priority, the aim is to enhance the capacities of the cultural and creative sectors to contribute to building more resilient and sustainable societies and encourage the necessary adaptation of practices in the sectors.
Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to Europe and the world. The cultural and creative sectors are already part of the response and have started to experiment and adopt transferable, inclusive and sustainable models to make production, distribution and access to culture more environmentally sustainable.
When addressing this priority, proposals could include awareness and/or capacity building activities that effectively help cultural operators to adopt and promote greener practices and contribute to the European Green Deal[9] and other initiatives, such as the New European Bauhaus[9], to make a difference to citizens’ quality of life.
help the European cultural and creative sectors to fully take advantage of new technologies to enhance their competiveness
The digital age represents a major challenge and opportunity for the cultural and creative sectors: the digital shift - accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic - is bringing about a change of paradigm, significantly impacting how cultural goods are created, managed, disseminated, accessed, consumed and monetised, and changing the value propositions which prevailed in the analogue era. Digitisation has facilitated the distribution of cultural and creative content and services, but it has also intensified competition of content across borders on a global scale.
In addition, data management, artificial intelligence, algorithms and computation can lead to concentration and harmonisation of tastes and can have negative consequences on cultural and linguistic diversity. In this framework, the sectors can make a major contribution to a critical, sensitive and human-centred approach to the digital transformation.
In the framework of this call, proposals should build the capacities of the cultural and creative sectors to critically and creatively embrace the above-mentioned opportunities and changes driven by the digital transformation. The EU’s digital strategy, “A Europe fit for the digital age[11]”, aims to make this transformation work for the sectors and for people.
Note: The way proposals address all the above-mentioned priorities will be assessed under the award criterion “relevance”. For more details, please check section 9.
All proposals should present a substantiated strategy and concrete details on how they plan to implement one or more of the above priorities.
Activities that can be funded (scope)
Proposals should include suitable activities for the reinforcement of the capacities of organisations and professionals active in the Creative and Cultural sectors. These activities have to be specifically designed to tackle the chosen priorities of the call in an effective way.
These activities should be formulated within a solid strategic framework and be structured in work packages. A work package means a major sub-division of the project. Each work package is accompanied by an objective (expected outcome) and should list the activities, milestones and deliverables that belong to it. (See section 10 – Milestones and Deliverables)
Activities should take into account the needs of the network members and facilitate members’ participation throughout the entire project. Details on this should be provided in the following section of the application form: “2.2 Partnership and consortium”. Under this call, financial support to third parties is eligible. For more details on the eligibility of activities, see section 6 (Eligibility of activities).
The quality of the proposed activities will be assessed under the award criterion “Quality of content and activities”. For more details, please check section 9.
Note: considering that this call for proposals is intended for action grants (projects) and not operating grants: statutory obligations such as board meetings, general assemblies, or any other similar statutory activity of the network, are not eligible under this call.
Expected impact
Support for about 30 networks covering different cultural and creative sectors.
This call is intended to have a structuring effect on Europe’s cultural and creative sectors (CCS) by targeting the above-mentioned priorities. This structuring effect should be tangible for the network members and/or for the CCS at large, and should be proportionate to the project objectives and scale.
The level of expected impact will be assessed under the award criterion “dissemination”. For more details, please check section 9.

Objectives
This action will support projects that aim to increase the visibility and the circulation of European emerging artists and works outside their own borders, in Europe and beyond. It also seeks to increase access to and participation in cultural events and activities, as well as audience engagement and development. Such projects are also designed to contribute to the implementation of EU policy priorities in the culture field. In this regard, the circulation of artists and works can contribute to the activation of new and/or more sustainable cultural public spaces.
For the purpose of this action, projects shall establish Platforms that can be defined as showcase/springboard platforms composed of a coordinating entity and member organisations with a common artistic editorial and branding strategy.
Themes and priorities (scope)
Further to the above-mentioned objective, proposals should mainstream the following themes and priorities:
• supporting emerging artists and cultural professionals and building adequate responses to the needs and challenges to support the internationalisation of their careers, which could include new models of creation, showcasing and exhibition, export strategy and distribution, and mobility and exchange
• promoting a fair, inclusive and diverse environment for emerging artists, looking particularly at effective ways to tackle the gender gap and fight discrimination. From this perspective, promoting equal opportunities, better working conditions and fair remuneration will be a strategic feature of proposed projects
• contributing to increasing the sectors’ environmental sustainability and awareness by demonstrating a capacity to propose and develop practices that contribute to the European Green Deal
All proposals should present a needs analysis and a substantiated strategy on how the above themes and priorities will be tackled.
Activities that can be funded (scope)
Activities shall be implemented in order to: (this is not an exhaustive list)
• train and nurture emerging talent;
• provide cultural organisations of all sizes and types with the opportunity to co-produce, cooperate and learn, by supporting these organisations with financial incentives (re-granting) and offering emerging artists concrete and professional opportunities;
• help emerging artists to reach a new and diverse audience and develop their careers by giving more visibility to their talent and work outside their borders, across Europe and beyond;
• promote, celebrate and boost the diversity of the European repertoire by developing a common European programming of non-national artists and ensuring the presence of these artists at major events, festivals, fairs and markets;
• develop a strong common communication and branding strategy, and establish a European quality label;
enforce measures to improve working conditions for emerging talents and cultural professionals;
• promote and encourage the digital shift to adapt to the substantial changes in how cultural goods are created, managed, disseminated, accessed, consumed and monetised, changing the value propositions which prevailed in the analogue era;
• enforce peer-learning and networking, notably with other Platforms and other projects, actions and initiatives supported by Creative Europe;
• develop and strengthen management capabilities with activities such as coordination activities, meetings, evaluation, quality control, reporting, etc.
Proposals should include suitable activities to meet the objective of the call and address the themes, priorities and cross-cutting issues in an effective way.
These activities should be formulated within a solid strategic framework and be structured in work packages. A work package is a major sub-division of the project. Each work package is accompanied by an objective (expected outcome) and should list the activities, milestones and deliverables that belong to it (See section 10 – Milestones and Deliverables).
Activities might be carried out both to complement and, as much as possible, be in synergy with: the European Commission’s pilot project on mobility (i-Portunus); the Creative Europe Prizes and initiatives; when relevant; the New European Bauhaus initiative.
Under this call for proposals, financial support to third parties is allowed. For more details see section 6 (Eligibility of activities).
The quality of the proposed activities, work packages, milestones and deliverables will be assessed under the award criterion ‘Quality of content and activities’. For more details, please check section 9 of this document.
Expected impact
The action aims to support about 15 platforms covering different cultural and creative sectors. As the support is intended to have a structuring effect, only a limited number of Platforms will be supported, with a view to achieving a balanced coverage across the different sectors. The intention is to support no more than one platform targeting the same type of artist or cultural work. This consideration will be taken into account by evaluators in the evaluation process.
Also, the action aims to have a critical impact on emerging artists and their careers, and as such the projects will have to:
• establish a platform composed of a coordinating organisation and member organisations (third parties);
• have a coordinated artistic editorial strategy to identify and showcase European emerging artists and their works outside their own borders;
• provide financial support (re-granting) to help member organisations to boost the diversity and visibility of their programming and increase the number of supported emerging artists;
• specify in the proposal the definition of “emerging artist”, in agreement with the member organisations, according to the project and the cultural sector in which the Platform operates;
• commit to spend at least 70% of the amount granted per year to concrete and direct support of emerging artists: artists fees, per diem, travel and subsistence, renting of space for exhibitions, showcases and rehearsals, insurance, mentoring, etc. (excluding administration costs);
• support at least 50 emerging artists per year (emerging artists taking part in any activity put in place by the Platform in the frame of the project and having received concrete and direct support);
• build a strategy to increase the number of members.
All of these measures are mandatory and must be clearly detailed in the proposal"

Specific challenge:
The aim is to engage small and medium enterprises in security research and development and in particular to facilitate and accelerate the transition of their developed products/services to the market place.
The specific challenge of the actions and activities envisaged under this topic are related to protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures .
Specific consideration should be given to 'urban soft targets', which are exposed to increasing security threats which can be defined as urban areas into which large numbers of citizens are freely admitted, for usual activities or special events or routinely reside or gather. Among others, these include parks, squares and markets, shopping malls, train and bus stations, passenger terminals, hotels and tourist resorts, cultural, historical, religious and educational centres and banks.
The critical infrastructures sectors listed in the European Programme for Critical Infrastructures Protection (EPCIP)[1], including, among others, energy installations and networks, communications and information technology, finance (banking, securities and investment), water (dams, storage, treatment and networks), supply chain and government (e.g. critical services, facilities, information networks, assets and key national sites and monuments) are not only relevant at a national scale but they can be considered critical infrastructures in an urban context as well.
The objective is to carry out a small-scale demonstration of innovative technologies and tools.
Taking into consideration the results of past and on-going EU and international research in this field, they can cover any aspect of the urban critical infrastructure protection, such as, for example: designing buildings and urban areas; protection of energy/transport/communication grids; critical infrastructure surveillance solutions; protecting supply chains; avoiding cyber-attacks and developing cyber resilience systems for critical infrastructures.
The scope of this topic is focused to cover, for example:
- high throughput screening of people and their bags including the ability to screen them in reasonably real-time as people approach entrances to buildings or enter public transportation system;
- high throughput screening for vehicles to identify threats that warrant further inspection (as opposed to random searching);
- potential CBRN-E threats and the way in which these threats could be carried-out against soft targets and critical infrastructures;
- mitigation of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (IED), with a specific focus on vehicle-borne ones (e.g. in cases of parked vehicles, penetrative attacks, etc.).
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as national law enforcement agencies public and and private operators of critical infrastructures and networks.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The proposals could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of protecting urban soft targets and critical infrastructures and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase & or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation (‘freedom to operate’).
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, if any, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge protecting urban soft targets in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

Specific challenge:
The aim is to engage small and medium enterprises in security research and development and in particular to facilitate and accelerate the transition of their developed products/services to the market place.
The specific challenge of the actions and activities envisaged under this topic are related to protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures .
Specific consideration should be given to 'urban soft targets', which are exposed to increasing security threats which can be defined as urban areas into which large numbers of citizens are freely admitted, for usual activities or special events or routinely reside or gather. Among others, these include parks, squares and markets, shopping malls, train and bus stations, passenger terminals, hotels and tourist resorts, cultural, historical, religious and educational centres and banks.
The critical infrastructures sectors listed in the European Programme for Critical Infrastructures Protection (EPCIP)[1], including, among others, energy installations and networks, communications and information technology, finance (banking, securities and investment), water (dams, storage, treatment and networks), supply chain and government (e.g. critical services, facilities, information networks, assets and key national sites and monuments) are not only relevant at a national scale but they can be considered critical infrastructures in an urban context as well.
The objective is to carry out a small-scale demonstration of innovative technologies and tools.
Taking into consideration the results of past and on-going EU and international research in this field, they can cover any aspect of the urban critical infrastructure protection, such as, for example: designing buildings and urban areas; protection of energy/transport/communication grids; critical infrastructure surveillance solutions; protecting supply chains; avoiding cyber-attacks and developing cyber resilience systems for critical infrastructures.
The scope of this topic is focused to cover, for example:
- high throughput screening of people and their bags including the ability to screen them in reasonably real-time as people approach entrances to buildings or enter public transportation system;
- high throughput screening for vehicles to identify threats that warrant further inspection (as opposed to random searching);
- potential CBRN-E threats and the way in which these threats could be carried-out against soft targets and critical infrastructures;
- mitigation of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (IED), with a specific focus on vehicle-borne ones (e.g. in cases of parked vehicles, penetrative attacks, etc.).
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as national law enforcement agencies public and and private operators of critical infrastructures and networks.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The proposals could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of protecting urban soft targets and critical infrastructures and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase & or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation (‘freedom to operate’).
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, if any, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.

Specific challenge:
The users/potential buyers participating in the action should agree on specifications, and set standards for the next generation of an EU interoperable radio communication system considering at least three markets: one for broadband network system technology/setup/operation, one for end-user devices and one for applications, taking into account previously EU funded R&D project on the same issues.
Scope:
Different organisation schemes, such as a dedicated EU Mobile Virtual Network Operator for law enforcement agencies, a European Economic Interest Group, national interoperable networks, or any other way will have to be studied.
The participants will propose the best suitable architecture/solution in order to establish the desired EU-interoperable system.
The action will develop the core set of specifications, roadmap for research or tender documents to be used as a basis for national procurements, or the legal setting of alternate organisational solutions taking into account the above-mentioned requirements for interoperable next generation PPDR broadband communication systems.
The action will provide plans for validating the future EU-interoperable system. Further to ongoing standardization efforts the users/potential buyers will have to ensure that manufacturers actually implement the PPDR-specific interoperability functions, and that users and operators test the first version of the systems as well as for their evolutions. Therefore the participants should tackle the issue of managing the interoperability after the end of the action.
The participants will establish a global transition roadmap from their actual system to the desired EU-interoperable system.
The EU may contribute to subsequent action to bootstrap the new architecture/solution if the CSA is successful and the new architecture/solution fulfils the conditions for receiving an EU contribution under the applicable rules.
Expected impact:
To create an EU-interoperable broadband radio communication system for public safety and security, providing better services to first responders and police agencies and allowing shorter reaction times to prevent from more casualties or victims, deployed by 2025.
It is expected that by delivering a European solution, the project should contribute to overcome the fragmentation of national markets and help maintaining global competitiveness of the European companies.
For the impact of the action to be above threshold the proposal must necessarily state:
the participants' commitment to make the standards, specifications, and all other relevant documents generated in the action available at actual cost of reproduction to any law enforcement or first responder organization established in an EU or EEA country.
the participants' agreement to negotiate, in good faith and on a case by case basis, licenses to the background necessary for the implementation and use of the contents of the standards, specifications, design, research roadmaps, tender packages or other tender documents generated in the action.
the participants' commitment that all such licenses shall be according to Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms.”
Type of action: Coordination and Support Action (CSA).
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €1m and €2m would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Timeframe: The action is expected to last between 6 and 12 months, and be completed on time for providing input to the 2017 work-programme of the Horizon 2020 ""Secure societies …"" challenge.
Additional condition: Proposals should involve a potential buyers group composed of first responders and police agencies from at least eight Member States or Associated Countries in a cross-border operational set-up. Justification for the additional condition: The aim of this topic is to create a new EU-wide system for public safety and security. The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of public bodies and law enforcement. For this to be achieved it is indispensable that a significant number of police forces and/or emergency services from many Member States or Associated Countries participate in achieving a broad commonality of needs.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Optoelectronics and opto-electrical components involve the interactions of photons and electrons. They are used in parts such as lasers, photodiodes, image sensors, optical amplifiers, modulators, solar cells, embedded optics and light-emitting diodes.
Previous research led to rapid developments and new applications in optoelectronics and photonics. However, new processes need to be introduced into production systems. When going into the scale-up phase, many processes need to be adjusted to fit the production of complex, often free-form components. The adjustments include both component specific changes as well as standard process steps. Due to the need to produce large varieties of parts in small batches, process adjustments have to be both rapid and accurate.
The equipment for testing, failure analysis and control equipment needs to follow a fast pace of technical advancement, and cover a range of sensors, such as electrical, optical, magnetic and thermal sensors.
Scope:
Proposals need to present a variety of new processes applicable to the production of opto-electrical components, for instance material handling, material strain engineering, patterning, material deposition, assembly, joining and bonding. Furthermore, quality needs to be ensured by reliable sensors throughout the production line. The processes need to include a level of sustainability that allows the final products to be recycled and reintroduced into the value chain. Proposals need to cover all of the following areas:
New, flexible, and innovative process chains to handle complex designs that include opto-electrical functionalities;
Improved sensor equipment for quality control in the different processing steps as well as the final functionality of the component;
Methodologies for improving quality through high-precision automation using the sensor data, including non-destructive in-process evaluation of material and functional component properties;
Re-use and requalification of key components and precious materials within the process chain from products at their end of life.
Proposals are expected to include a variety of use-case demonstrations of typical opto-electrical components, in which the robustness of the processing, work piece handling, sensing and the automation approach can be demonstrated.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
15% yield improvement because of the introduction of new sensor equipment, related metrology and automatic non-destructive control;
15% time reduction for reconfiguration of key process tools in a production line due to change of type of component;
A tangible part (> 10%) of the production cost of the parts should originate from recycled products and materials.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

Costs and unpredictable defects in final parts and products are preventing complete deployment and adoption of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the metalworking industries.
The industrial demonstration in a pilot line will show the full potential of metal AM in real manufacturing conditions and it will serve as a flagship example for other stakeholders. Quality aspects to be significantly improved include robustness, stability, repeatability, speed and right-first-time manufacturing.
Scope:
Multi-scale and multi-physics simulations of the process and of the whole system from the early design phase, to avoid costly trial and error runs. The prediction and minimisation of distortion and their effect on durability and expected lifetime for post processing steps will also avoid propagation of defects to downstream stages;
In-line non-destructive testing and in-situ analysis of product, including metrology aspects;
Integration and inter-operability of AM processes into multi-stage production systems, with in-process monitoring, feedback and control;
Hybridisation of Additive Manufacturing with other manufacturing and assembling processes;
Certification, regulatory and standardisation activities related to the proposed solutions and AM produced parts;
Occupational exposure in terms of health, safety and environment should be carefully observed together with the recycling of unused materials.
Proposals are expected to cover demonstration activities driven by the industrial community.

In line with the circular economy, lifetime extension can limit high replacement costs of major industrial infrastructures. This can be achieved through refurbishment, re-manufacturing, re-use, upgrading, in-situ repair, improved maintenance and more conservative utilisation of large industrial equipment of the kind used in manufacturing. These actions can significantly extend the useful life of heavy machinery, and improve the return on investment from major capital items.
Scope:
This topic is for demonstration projects to establish the feasibility of lifetime extension of large industrial equipment of the kind used in manufacturing, including modernisation of equipment for data collection and interfaces. Proposals should cover one or more of the following areas:
refurbishment and/or upgrading of large industrial equipment;
re-manufacturing and re-use of equipment;
inspection, functional diagnosis and in-situ repair of damage;
maintenance and optimised utilisation of large industrial equipment.
These measures can improve the return on investment from major capital items. The scope covers large-scale electrical and/or mechanical machinery in plants rather than electronic equipment, which earlier projects have already covered.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Rapid changes in a production line require a significant flexibility of reconfiguration. Modular production equipment can create highly adaptable production lines to enable efficient production of small series tailored to customer demands. Previous research has shown that the modularity can be at two levels, either as complete machines with their own interface and material handling system or as interchangeable tool heads. In both cases, the advantage of modularity should be demonstrated by the ease of use and plug-and-produce features allowing for rapid modification.
The functionality of the modules should enable the production of the widest variety of complex products. The modules need to allow rapid physical rearrangements, through either automated processes or manual intervention; and have accessible, secure interfaces in order to be connected to a common data system for production control. The interfacing with the existing hardware and legacy software is another aspect that needs to be covered.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to start from existing test beds that are flexible enough to allow for the introduction of multiple modular process units. Proposals should cover all of the following areas:
The development of a range of production modules covering several different disciplines such as mechanical cutting tools, thermal processes, laser treatments and additive manufacturing technologies, taking into account safety aspects;
The integration of comprehensive production management systems, including real-time process control in a reconfigurable line, which includes considerations for data interoperability between modules and process line (including legacy hardware and software);
Pilot production of different products covering processing technologies and features such as multi-functionality (mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, etc.), multi materials, and complex shapes.
The production modules could be considered as demonstrators on their own. However, their integration in the pilot line as well as an actual production demonstration with a variety of components or product prototypes should be achieved before the end of the project.
Proposals are expected to cover demonstration activities driven by the industrial community.

Improving industrial energy efficiency requires the integration of energy data, such as historical data, real-time data and real-time predicted energy cost, into the production management systems. Manufacturing systems are complex because many parameters, related to environment, components, usage of materials, machines, cells, lines and supply chains, collectively influence the energy performance of production processes.
Different technologies of energy-efficient manufacturing have already been studied in the past. However, the challenge is now to combine all these technologies in a holistic, intelligent and interoperable approach to ensure a comprehensive implementation, providing significant energy savings.
Scope:
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) are valuable tools to enable factories to improve their energy efficiency by monitoring energy-related flows and data. In addition to closed-loop flexible approaches, near real-time intelligent (recognising cause-effect-relationships) and transparent management of the production system can improve traditional LCA/LCCA towards more ambitious energy saving.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:
Combination of ICT, such as digital twin, big data analysis, internet of things, cloud technologies and artificial intelligence, leading to a shift from diagnosis to prognosis in controlling the consumption and cost of energy in manufacturing;
Information collection and compilation linking the environmental footprint of a given manufacturing process/plant from the equipment component to the whole facility and the entire value chain;
Demonstration of design approaches and technologies, through at least two complex industrial case studies, with application across different manufacturing sectors;
Certification, regulatory and standardisation activities related to the proposed solutions with the specific focus on the compatibility of energy and environmental data across different manufacturing sectors.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

Energy consumption reduction for the improved production process of at least 25% ;
Life Cycle Cost reduction of at least 15%;
Improved environmental performance of the involved products;
Development of standardised European energy-efficient best practices to overcome the barriers limiting their application in the manufacturing sectors.

The production of large-scale parts has achieved so far a relatively low level of mechanisation and automation because standard machines and design procedures are not suitable for these parts and specific equipment is too slow and too expensive. Moreover, repairing large parts requires operating in difficult spaces. All this causes problems of quality and repeatability. Therefore, industry needs more automated production and in-situ repair methods for new innovative and multi-functional products.
Recent research in the large-scale parts production has delivered high quality demonstrators, although generally quite specific and with a too limited impact. Full-scale, reconfigurable, modular and flexible pilot lines including different processing facilities, thermal treatment, control and characterisation could demonstrate comprehensive highly visible prototypes.
Scope:
The proposals should deliver reliable high-precision processes to manufacture and repair innovative large-scale parts, such as wind turbine blades, large vehicles (aerospace, road or rail), ships or ship segments, construction components, large industrial components, etc. Proposals should cover at least three of the following areas and demonstrate them in a relevant industrial environment:
Upgrading manufacturing equipment using several innovative steps for high precision manufacturing, in order to obtain an integrated and modular process;
Implement design, modelling and simulation tools to support the selection of processing parameters;
Introduce new methods and instruments for process characterisation and in-line process control of the large-scale parts, to guarantee the quality of the final outcomes including high precision (e.g. non-destructive testing);
Develop work-holding devices to reduce the repositioning of all components, as well as new methods for equipment calibration and in-process fast recalibration.
Proposals should cover demonstration activities in industrial settings building on the outcomes of the Factories of the Future programme. Open Access to the pilot lines for training people is strongly encouraged.

Smart factories are characterised by processes involving interlinked work pieces and associated tools as well as logistics operations. These are generating large amounts of data, which can be used for analysis and prediction as well as to optimise the quality of manufacturing operations and manufactured products. However, a major challenge for manufacturing is the reliability of data.
Scope:
To address the challenge of data reliability, the sensors, actuators and instruments used at various levels of integration in the manufacturing process – often operating under adverse physical conditions – need to provide adequate levels of data accuracy and precision. Measurement traceability should ensure optimal manufacturing quality. Furthermore, suitable modelling and simulation approaches and data fusion techniques are needed to interpret and use sensor/actuator data in a factory.
Proposals should therefore address at least three of the following aspects:
Integrate intelligent, cognitive, adaptive and cost-effective instruments and systems of sensors/actuators for process monitoring and control (e.g. virtual sensors and digital twins) into existing production or pilot lines;
Showcase real-time data validation within an actual production line, and incorporate data integrity strategies based on, e.g., distributed ledger (blockchain) technology.
Demonstrate how distributed, time stamped and persistent solutions for automated collection, storage, analysis and use of production data can lead to an integrated approach to zero-defect manufacturing;
Develop strategies for rapid line qualification and reconfiguration based on large pre-existing data sets and related open protocols.

Miniaturisation leads to new functionalities, weight reduction and energy and material saving. European industry has currently a leading position in this field, but investments in research and development of new micro-manufacturing techniques are necessary to maintain this advantage. European industry has the technology to produce and assemble micro-scale objects (i.e. objects with a total volume < 1 mm3 and with the smallest dimension between 10µm and 300µm). However, further efforts are needed to combine accuracy, speed, productivity, efficiency and reliability. New production lines must be able to detect and adapt with minimum human involvement to variations in the environment or of the components. Manufacturing technologies used for larger parts cannot be directly applied to micro part assembly because physical phenomena that can be ignored at larger scale may strongly affect micro systems. Models of micro systems assembly processes are needed that take these effects into account.
Scope:
The proposal should focus on new assembly technologies, such as additive manufacturing, especially for products, that contain micro-parts and which are assembled manually for most of the part because of technical limitations. For this purpose, proposals should cover at least three of the following areas:
Design for micro-assembly and micro-disassembly including procedures, standardisation aspects and indices to assess the performance of micro-assembly devices;
High throughput systems for micro-handling and assembly, including robust strategies to precisely grasp and release parts, considering also technologies such as piezo-material based solutions and micro-robots;
In-line monitoring and quality assessment for the parts as well as for the assemblies;
Closed-loop error compensation and optimisation models and algorithms adaptable to the specific working conditions;
Advanced control methods and/or human in the loop strategies, dynamic task planning.
Proposals should include pilots where industrial end-users will validate the demonstrated processes. The proposed solutions should respect the environment and workers, be economically viable and easily transferable to other sectors or product types.

Multidisciplinary research for the development of Organ-on-Chip technologies able to mimic human organs and organ-systems, based on integrated platforms involving technologies such as: cell culturing (including multi-tissue or multi-organ arrangements), micro-fluidics, micro/nano-sensors, imaging, actuators, 3D bio-printing, modelling and simulation, bioinformatics;
Demonstrator applications involving modelling, diagnosis and therapy of human disease(s) of high and yet unmet medical need. The new devices should permit the simulation of body system processes under adverse conditions and in particular in disease states, healing and regeneration under mechanical stress and electrical stimulation, or immune responses, taking into account sex and gender differences, when relevant;

The standardised data documentation should be developed with a global ambition through international cooperation.
Scope:
The proposals should develop EU-wide standardised data documentation that ensures interoperability of data. The data documentation should take the form of an actionable ontology that consists of a top level ontology, adapted existing domain ontologies (such as manufacturing, materials processing, materials modelling, nano-safety, characterisation and life cycle sustainable analysis ontologies), complemented by new ontologies for other subdomains,.
In particular, the projects should:
Network relevant stakeholders to collect input on existing data documentation;
Develop and agree on a top level ontology to connect relevant subdomains of this work programme
Harmonise existing ontologies with respect to the top level ontology.
Develop and agree on new ontologies for relevant sub-domains of this work programme
Deliver at least ten demonstrators on the use of ontologies (decision systems, innovation projects, workflows, quality assurance, guided AI and data parsing…)
Projects should liaise with the work done under the European Open Science Cloud, standardisation bodies, the Research Data Alliance and other relevant initiatives. Existing taxonomies and/or ontologies relevant for this part of the programme should be taken into account. Therefore, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package for this cooperation and earmark appropriate resources.

Activities should include material development and improvement (electrical performance, processability, stability and lifetime during device operation), as well as prototyping of advanced OLAE based electronic products. New materials and process development should cover all of the following:
Combine materials with high uniformity and with high mobility in industrial quantities with high reproducible quality;
Improved environmental stability to enable operation in more robust environments and to reduce barrier requirements;
Seamless integration of the new technology into traditional and new products;
Advance the TRL of OLAE and enhance its manufacturability including high speed processes for the integration of flexible OLAE components onto flexible substrates;
Cost reduction for the structuring and processing of organic electronic materials into device structures;
Demonstration of OLAE-enabled prototypes in selected applications of flexible and wearable electronics.
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
New products based on the combination of printed and OLAE processed electronics in flexible and wearable electronics;
Improvement in cost competitiveness, lifetime and processability as well as manufacturing capability for OLAE materials and electronics;
Improved environmental stability, water vapour transmission rates < 10-6 gm-2 d-1 at 20°C/50% RH and oxygen transmission rates < 10-6 cm3 m-2 d-1 bar-1, of organic electronic materials for products. Improved printable commercial material charge carrier mobility > 5 -10 cm2/Vs;
Improved business opportunities and value creation in Europe by strengthening cooperation along the value chain as demonstrated by prototypes at TRL 5 that are taken to early-concept market trials with market introduction of new products in 2-4 years after project completion.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
This topic will be co-funded by LEIT-NMBP and LEIT-ICT, for a total budget of EUR 20 million."

","Innovation action
","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European agriculture could gain a decisive competitive advantage if the ICT sector and the farming community could work together to generate a wave of bottom-up ICT innovations across Europe designed to create more productive and sustainable agricultural systems. The topic will facilitate the adoption and widespread transfer of ICT-based solutions for agriculture.
The Digitising European Industry Strategy[1] aims to ensure that every business in Europe has access to a Digital Innovation Hub at ‘a working distance’. A Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) helps companies become more competitive by improving their business/production processes, products and services through the use of digital technologies. DIHs offer services to test and experiment with advanced technologies and produce innovative products/solutions. They should also act as a broker between user companies and technology suppliers.
Many components of Digital Innovation Hubs already exist at European, national and regional level.[2] Through this topic, the European Commission is adding value to these existing investments by supporting highly innovative experimentation on a pan-European scale.
Scope:
The topic calls for promoting Digital Innovation Hubs in agriculture. It should address the adoption of ICT-based solutions for more productive and sustainable agriculture systems. The focus is on innovative technologies that need to be customized, integrated, tested and validated not only by technology developers but also the farming community before they are placed on the market. Special emphasis is on the strengthening of European start-ups and SMEs by adopting new concepts linked to innovative agri-business and/or service models, and connecting them with actors that can provide access to finance, advanced training skills, knowledge and needs of the farming community.
Hence, the following is requested for this topic:
Organisations participating in the call should demonstrate that they are deeply rooted in a digital innovation hub that offers digital transformation services to companies in its proximity. They should provide a clear analysis of how the proposed project will add value to the existing service offer, and how it is aligned with the national or regional digitisation initiative. Every project should support a critical mass of dedicated pan-European innovation experiments that bring together technology suppliers and the farming sector. At least 50% of the budget should directly benefit SMEs. The action may involve financial support to third parties. The proposal will define the process of selecting entities for which financial support will be granted, typically in the order of 40.000 – 100.000 per party[3];
Activities proposed should be sustainable in the long term and must include a business plan for the Digital Innovation Hubs, a plan to attract investors, to address needs of the farming sector and dissemination activities. The use of established networks for SMEs such as the Enterprise Europe network is encouraged;
The project should create a network and help achieve a broad coverage in terms of technological aspects, application, innovation and geography. It should also link up with regional/national innovation initiatives and other DIHs. This shall include maintaining a single innovation portal, sharing of best practice, dissemination, brokerage between ICT suppliers and farming users, leveraging investment and training;
Selected projects are expected to collaborate on building a network of Digital Innovation Hubs, covering most regions in Europe[4].
Proposals should fall under the concept of the multi-actor approach[5].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 10 mill would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals must promote the creation of a self-sustaining innovation ecosystem of competence centres, farming users and suppliers supported by services available through a marketplace, covering a large number of regions. Through the creation of a sustainable network of Digital Innovation Hubs, proposals will provide European added value to investments made at national and regional level in DIH. It should have a high leveraging effect on other sources of funding, in particular regional and national funding.
In the short to medium term work will:
Attract a significant number of new users of ICT in the agricultural sector;
Attract a significant number of innovative and competitive technology suppliers (start-ups and SMEs) able to supply the farming community with new solutions for improving farming operations;
Create a critical mass of pan-European experiments that explore new application areas for ICT in agriculture in general;
Increase deployment of technologies in the agriculture sector.
In the longer term funded activities will create sustainable production systems and increase the competitiveness of the farming sector.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
District heating's share on heat supply in Europe is about 7.4%, with some Member States and Associated Countries having a much higher share. In order to preserve existing heating networks and to increase their efficiency, successful approaches to diagnosing and retrofitting inefficient networks, including sustainable business and organisational models, have to be widely promoted and disseminated.
Many systems are old and inefficient and run using fossil fuels. These systems often have poor maintenance, high customer heat costs and limited ability for user control undermining the image of district heating. The result is that a significant number of customers disconnect from district heating networks and install individual heating systems which do not always take advantage of the potential for efficiency gains. The retrofitting of these district heating systems can offer a cost effective approach to supplying efficient heat. Schemes can include city-wide networks or networks at the district/neighbourhood level.
Scope:
Actions are needed to accelerate the cost effective and energy efficient retrofitting existing, inefficient district heating networks.
Activities supported under this topic should replicate or develop successful technical, managerial, organisational and financial approaches and should lead to the initiation of concrete schemes that guarantee substantial primary energy savings and efficiency gains, including the use of renewable and residual sources of heat as appropriate. Proposals should engage and involve as necessary, those in charge of city networks, district heating companies, managers of buildings blocks, housing associations and other building owners/managers and end consumers. Proposals should also lead to the development of concrete regional or national action plans for the retrofitting of inefficient district heating networks.
As necessary, actions should consider interventions that are needed on the building side, e.g. retrofitting and / or modifications of internal heat distribution systems and system and end user controls. They should also take into account the evolution of thermal demand in the future due to improving building energy performance standards and increased rate of building renovations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary energy savings and GHG emission savings triggered by the proposed actions (compared to best available solution existing today), considering the different climate regions of Europe;
Increased share of waste/residual and renewable sources of heat;
Scale of the replicability potential of the proposed solutions;
Number of retrofitting approaches initiated by the project within its duration which are integrated in the regional or national action plans."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe is not recovering enough of its waste energy. A vast amount of waste heat is produced in urban areas from a range of local sources (e.g. from metros, large buildings, extensive ventilation systems) and from urban waste or waste water systems. Data centres are another rapidly growing sector generating heat that could potentially be recovered and reused for heating or cooling buildings.
Thermal energy captured can be supplied through individual central heating and cooling systems or distributed through district heating and cooling networks to multiple buildings. In some cases, it might be needed to combine the recovery of waste heat with different technologies, (e.g., heat pumps) in order to bring the temperature level of the waste heat to those matching the existing heating and cooling applications addressed in the proposal.
Scope:
Demonstrate waste heat and waste water heat recovery in urban areas, in services sector and transport system facilities and their connection and integration into the existing heating and cooling supply systems in buildings/facilities or district heating/cooling systems. Focus should be given to replicability, scalability and modularity that facilitate application and rapid deployment. Develop sustainable business models and organisational, managerial, and financial solutions for deployment of the proposed technological solutions in the EU, with due regard to the legislative framework.
Projects should build on previous projects supported under FP7 and Horizon 2020. The activities are expected to be implemented at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6-8 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","30 September 2014
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: By the end of 2020 (2018 for buildings occupied and owned by public authorities), all new buildings should comply with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive obligations and thus meet 'nearly zero-energy' performance levels using innovative, cost-optimal technologies with integration of renewable energy sources on site or nearby. The drive for nearly zero-energy buildings takes place in the context of the drive for new-buildings towards zero life-cycle material impacts. Moreover, the construction of 'plus-energy' buildings - i.e. buildings producing more energy than they consume - should also be encouraged in order to reduce energy use whilst increasing the share of renewable energies. However the costs of these highly energy performing buildings still represent a barrier for investors. Therefore the construction industry needs to deliver more affordable solutions.
Scope:Projects should focus on development and demonstration of solutions which significantly reduce the cost of new buildings with at least 'nearly zero-energy' performance levels, whilst accelerating significantly the speed with which these buildings and their systems are taken up by the market. The focus should lie on solutions for appropriate indoor air quality and comfort, design adapted to local climate and site, passive solutions (reducing the need for technical building systems which consume energy) or active solutions (covering a high share of the energy demand with renewable energies), building energy management systems (where appropriate), highly efficient Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC, e.g. low temperature systems, solar cooling), electric and/or thermal energy storage of renewable energy onsite and nearby. Projects should also provide solutions for automated and cost-effective maintenance of the installed equipment, and assess differences between predicted and actual energy performance. Such differences should be documented and minimized.
The applied solutions should address the challenge to move towards a 'nearly-zero energy' buildings standard at large scale with demonstration projects that go beyond 'nearly-zero energy' buildings levels to the point where buildings are active contributors to energy production and environmental quality in particular when new districts are planned (e.g. net-zero energy neighbourhoods). The energy balance should be calculated by means of a LCA approach, considering among other issues embodied energy.
Projects should also focus on design methods for on-site and nearby-generation of renewable energy for new buildings (electricity as well as heating and cooling generation, e.g. heat pumps, integrated photovoltaics, or other options) accompanying energy efficiency measures to achieve standards higher than those of 'nearly zero-energy' buildings.
The performance of innovative technologies may be verified through technology verification schemes such as the EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) pilot programme[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic will be implemented under the PPP on Energy-efficient Buildings.
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 5-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Expected Impact: Significant increase of the share of 'nearly zero-energy' buildings with the aim of 100% market uptake by the end of 2020. Costs reductions of at least 15% compared to current situation, with additional benefits in terms of energy reduction. Demonstration for net-zero energy districts taking advantage of onsite or nearby-generation of renewable energy.

In order to achieve the EU 2020 energy efficiency objectives, the renovation rate needs to increase from the present level of 1.2% per annum to at least 2-3% (with a specific target for the public sector of 3%) and the energy performance of renovations needs to improve. Both the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive (EPBD) and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) contain several provisions in this respect. The environmental sustainability of renovation process but more importantly, the health and wellbeing of the occupants are also relevant. This might lead to consideration of aspects partially covered by different pieces of EU legislation such as REACH, the Water Framework Directive[1], the Construction Products Regulation[2], etc.
Many barriers, which are not necessarily technological, hamper the implementation of these provisions. For example: diversity and fragmentation within the building value chain; inefficient and complex renovation processes; a lack of deep renovation packages; low development and uptake of financial packages or incentives (e.g. grants, credits); unclear energy or environmental requirements in renovation grants or procurement processes; low progress in performance guarantees. There is therefore, a need to overcome these regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to facilitate the renovation of existing building stocks.
Scope:
The focus of submitted proposals should be aiming at overcoming market barriers to deep renovation within the value chain. Any building type may be included (public or private, residential or non-residential).
Renovations can take place at one point in time or be staged in a step-by-step approach, but in any case they should strive to achieve ""deep renovation"" (at least 60% energy savings compared to pre-renovation levels) or aim towards Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) performance. Proposals might consider integration of voluntary certification schemes along with energy performance certificate, including elements of indoor quality classification for buildings.
Proposals should address at least two of the following options (list not exhaustive):
Support to consumers or end-users
Support the implementation of renovation road maps resulting from the EED/EPBD
Address the gap between designed and actual energy performance; support reliable energy performance standards, quality of certification and labelling schemes, etc.
Increase the number of deep renovations by means of :
Solutions that offer affordable deep renovation to a large number of individual consumers (e.g. owners or end-users) and/or
Targeting large groups of building units in order to take advantage of opportunities for simplification and cost reduction and the potential for further replication.
Support the use of existing financial mechanisms, instruments and innovative business models to address market failures, in particular split incentives.
The proposals should build on previous experience, including the outcome of Intelligent Energy Europe projects.
Synergies may be considered with activities initiated under the topic LCE-17-2017.

Such cooperation can be done via clustering buildings and processes, by energy exchange, collective production and joint contracting of mutualised energy services. However, there are a number of barriers that hinder the development of energy cooperation of neighbouring businesses. These barriers are mostly organisational, financial, legal, social and technical.
The use of joint contracting of mutualised energy services is a promising model for industrial parks, especially when businesses are not energy intensive and when they don't have the time, expertise and financial resources to develop such energy cooperation. In that sense, energy services companies have a role to play in providing businesses with high-value services in the form of e.g. heating, electricity, cooling, to master a modern, environmentally friendly, renewable based and energy efficient system in industrial parks relying on the latest technologies and solutions (e.g. highly efficient, renewable and waste/residual recovery based systems, demand response, energy cascades).
Scope:
Proposals should improve the energy efficiency of industrial parks (or neighbouring businesses) by unlocking the market potential for energy cooperation and by supporting the demand and offer of mutualised high-quality energy services.
Proposals should address at least one of the following aspects:
implementation of energy cooperation between businesses: develop and test instruments facilitating the actual implementation of energy cooperation between businesses (e.g., setting appropriate process and business organisation, operation and plant design, cooperation mechanisms, related contractual and financial arrangements, better planning of industrial parks, good practices, etc.). Proposals should include related capacity building issues: increasing the skills and engagement of companies, via e.g. their CEOs and CFOs, energy managers and other related stakeholders to identify and accelerate the development of energy cooperation;
implementation of joint energy services: develop and test replicable business models and service concepts for joint energy services provided by ESCO or other relevant third party (e.g. identification of horizontal energy services attractive for businesses, identification of the most relevant innovative technical solutions, setting contractual and financial arrangements, good practices to engage companies in mutualised energy services, cost-calculation and cost-reduction models, etc.). Proposals should include related capacity building issues in order to increase the skills, know-how and specific expertise of ESCOs or other relevant third party to boost the market for joint contracting energy services in industrial parks.
Proposals should address legal issues in order to adapt regulatory and legal frameworks at the local, regional and national context. Proposals should also have a cross-cutting perspective and a strong communication and dissemination component to reach as many industries, industrial parks manager and ESCOs as possible and to break the industrial cultural perception of mutualised energy services and energy cooperation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below (wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets), depending on the scope of the proposal:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year per million Euro of EU funding);
Deployment of replicable energy concept with the goal to increase the competitiveness of enterprises;
Deployment of replicable business models and market offer for joint contracting energy services for industrial parks;
Number of companies/ESCOs/energy managers and other market stakeholders with increased skills/capability/competencies (to be measured in number of people with increased capacity);
Policies and legal frameworks created/adapted to facilitate energy cooperation among businesses at all governance levels (to be measured in Number of citations / statements from governance bodies)."

Specific challenge: Heat recovery represents an important and unexplored opportunity for reducing energy use in industrial processes and in heating and cooling. Surplus heat is produced in large quantities in many industrial processes but remains largely unutilised due to various technological, market and regulatory barriers. The huge potential for utilising industrial surplus heat should be evaluated not only in the context of increased industrial efficiency, when this heat is recovered for further use in internal processes and for the space heating or cooling and warm water requirements of specific plants, but also in the context of decarbonisation and resource efficiency of the energy supply and the potential of significantly reducing primary energy consumption. Many of the potential solutions for recovering wasted energy can be replicated across several industrial sectors (e.g. food exothermic fermentations and heat dissipative technologies)  or can be made adaptable to the specificities of the various industrial sectors. However, to exploit this potential, it is critical to increase the economic competitiveness of waste heat recovery and develop ready-made practical solutions allowing its mainstreaming into normal operation practices of industrial plants. To minimize the economic costs of heat recovery, and prepare its integration into plant processes and organisation, technologies, new equipment and adaptable integration solutions should be developed and tested in real-world conditions, through research and development of prototypes and industrial procedures. Equally considered in this call are heat recovery solutions that involve the upgrading of waste heat streams to process heat streams at higher temperature levels and heat recovery solutions that involve the conversion of waste heat streams to electric of mechanical energy.
Responses to this call will include proposals for demonstrating replicable technologies to recover and use process heat adaptable to various types of industrial processes, to recover heat from material flows from industrial processes (e.g. waste streams, by-products, intermediates) or surplus heat in plant perimeters.
Scope: Research and demonstration on technologies, technical and operational approaches to recover waste heat from industrial processes, from material flows originating in industrial processes (e.g. waste streams, by-products, intermediates) or plant perimeters and to transform it into useful energy forms. Their integration will bring new and innovative solutions, systems, equipment and methodologies, organisation and operational practices and applications useful in several industrial sectors with the highest possible efficiency and quality.
To achieve this goal, a complete validation at real production conditions is preferred with demo sites where pilot systems will be tested in industrial facilities. Furthermore, the equipment developed will need to be adapted to market readiness level. Main subjects to be developed include:
Technical, organisational and operational solutions addressing heat recovery for process internal use, plant internal use and plant external use, including adaptable solutions for process interface;
Integration and optimization of the heat chain, including fuel substitution and efficient use of heat recovered from material flows originating in industrial processes (e.g. waste streams, by-products, intermediates);
Evaluating waste heat recovery potentials internally and externally; planning, modelling, maximising and implementing heat recovery options in the plant energy balance and locally;
Advanced control and operation techniques, automation and safety measures and protocols
Adaptable heat recovery modules for heat recovery in various process and from various sources, heat usage equipment, site and process design, operation organisations
Advanced co-generation and trigeneration, energy cascading
Evaluation of and adaptable and replicable solutions for non-technological issues  that hamper heat recovery and a larger use of heat recovered, such as process and business organisation, operation and plant design, cooperation mechanisms, contractual and financial  arrangements.
The aim is to achieve wide replicability and adaptability to the specificities in different sectors. It is expected to identify and combine the best technologies and most innovative solutions to reduce the total energy consumption and the operation costs of the plant. Methodologies and equipment will be subjected to a large validation by means of activities at demo sites. Proposals should show large replication potential.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 4-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Expected impact:
Design development and demonstration of economically viable solutions and technologies allowing recovering at least 15% of process heat leading to significant savings of energy compared with current practice.
Adaptable technical, organisational and operational modules and producers to internal and external heat recovery
In parallel, perceived technical and business risks will be reduced leading to widespread uptake of the technical solutions with a high impact in several industrial sectors
The technologies developed should integrate well in the current industrial landscape ultimately leading to turn-key solutions with a pay-back time appropriate for industrial applications.

","Innovation action
","26 July 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy and fuels represent between 20% and 40% of the production costs in several Resource and Energy Intensive Industries (REII). A lot of technical progresses were already done in REII to reduce the energy consumption of the main industrial products. Nevertheless, significant parts of the input-energy are still lost in the form of waste heat by gas, liquid or solid streams.
Those losses occur because either the corresponding heat losses are difficult to recover and re-use in the process itself or in another part of the production process or the required equipment are too costly (low ROI).
The challenge is to design, build, test & demonstrate new processes/components or innovative adaptation of existing solutions for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems.
Furthermore, sources of heat losses for a given industry could be a valuable resource for another one, directly or after an intermediate transformation step. By reusing waste and residual heat in a more efficient way primary energy can be saved. This topic responds to the needs of the process industry identified in the roadmap of the SPIRE cPPP (Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency contractual Public-Private Partnership).
Scope:
Actions should improve the energy efficiency of large industrial systems by designing economically viable industrial solutions based on innovative technologies for recovery of waste heat or the innovative adaptation of already existing solutions for waste heat recovery. Actions should address the recovery of waste heat from streams from industrial processes (e.g. waste streams, by-products, intermediates) or from surplus heat in plant parameters to transform it in useful energy forms, including the production of technical gases (e.g. oxygen, hydrogen) to be used in the industrial process itself or exported as by-products. Solutions should be adaptable to various types of industrial processes and should be validated by full scale demonstration in real production conditions in industrial facilities.
Actions could either propose innovative technologies for the efficient recovery of waste heat in large industrial systems or innovative solutions of energy symbiosis between industries or plants inside industrial parks for the valorisation of waste and residual heat. Only one or the other should be addressed by the proposed actions.
For actions proposing innovative technologies for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems one or more of the following technological issues should be addressed:
The intermittent character of the recoverable energy flows and its variations during normal operating conditions e.g. adapted storage to smooth these variations (such as low materials cost with high thermal inertia, Phase Change Materials, commodities storage, etc.);
Achieving safe, controlled and efficient recovery of heat from media, which are very difficult to handle and control (high temperature, high volumes, highly aggressive- fouling/deposits/corrosion);
The transfer of energy flows from a process line to the other one, and investigating the potential use of recovered energy in other processes with various heat transfer media (water/steam, oil, salts, gases….);
The influences of the new heat recovery process on the product quality (e.g. dry cooling instead of wet cooling);
Actions proposing innovative solutions of energy symbiosis between industries or plants inside large industrial parks for the valorisation of waste heat should cover, if possible, all the following points:
To analyse, characterise and assess the sources of energy losses in the spirit of reusing them in other plants or industries (e.g. amount, composition, temperature, impurity and fluctuation have to be taken into account, improving the global environmental impact, and new measurements and models could be needed to identity them) and to identify the relevant heat and energy demands;
To determine and demonstrate flexible solutions to coordinate the sources and demands and to optimise the energy fluxes between the different plants and industries. Interactions between the industrial site and the surroundings should be taken into account as an additional opportunity for valorisation of waste/residual heat. New management systems for the energy loss fluxes have to be developed;
To determine and demonstrate innovative storage technologies and strategies to harmonize energy use for fluctuating inputs (e.g. wind, converter gas) and variable (batch) process demands and to exploit the variations of the hourly electricity price;
To determine and demonstrate innovative conversion technologies and strategies to improve the accordance of demands and sources of energy;
To define the most suitable energy carriers to be implemented at the proper scale in the environment representative of industrial application.
New management systems for the waste energy fluxes have to be developed basing on the parameters and models described above.
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 5-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
For 2016 only:
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For 2017 only:
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between:
EUR 4-5 million for actions proposing innovative technologies for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems
EUR 5-6 million for actions proposing innovative solutions for energy symbiosis between industries or plants inside large industrial parks for the valorisation of waste heat (more complex and costly actions)
would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets, wherever possible.
For actions proposing innovative technologies for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems:
Recovery of at least 40% of the sensible heat contained in each waste heat carrier addressed by the project.
Measureable substantial primary energy savings clearly quantified and substantiated, and subsequent reduction of CO2 emissions
The improvement of the energy efficiency and the reduction of energy cost will lead to a demonstrated advancement in competitiveness by the end of the project. This will expand the available portfolio of energy resources and technologies, which can be integrated within sites, across sectors and along value chains.

Considering the large volume of public spending (19% of EU GDP, or roughly EUR 2,200 billion in 2009), the public sector constitute an important driver to stimulate market transformation towards more sustainable energy-related products and services. The Energy Efficiency Directive requires that central governments purchase only products, services and buildings with high energy-efficiency performance. Public Procurement of Innovative solutions (PPI) is not sufficiently developed in the field of energy efficiency although it could support the market up-take of energy efficient goods, buildings or services.
Scope:
Actions enabling a group of procurers (buyers group) to undertake a PPI procurement for innovative solutions for, products, services buildings (NZEB, renovation) which are not yet available on a large-scale commercial basis, and which have energy performance levels that are better than the best levels available on the market. The innovative solutions procured by all procurers in the buyers group must have the same core functionality and performance characteristics, but may have additional 'local' functionality due to differences in the local context of each individual procurer. Actions should lead to the first application / commercialisation of the innovative solution, in order to assure its market uptake. Functional/performance based specifications should be ambitious but achievable without the procurement of research and development and without distorting competition. Where appropriate, proposals should build upon the outputs of ongoing projects (including the Project Development Assistance projects), networks, guides, tools, and rely on the use of cost – benefit analysis (e.g. using a life- cycle approach). Proposals may use the Procurement of Innovation Platform supported by the European Commission. The procurement of innovation process should be associated with coordination and networking activities that embed the PPI into a wider set of demand side activities, including the removal of marked barriers (e.g. lack of knowledge, practical training, tailored guidelines and legal uncertainties) and awareness and knowledge sharing activities. Other entities (e.g. end-users, certification bodies, private/NGO procurers that provide services of public interest and share the same procurement need) whose participation is well justified may participate in additional activities that clearly add value to the action. Proposals should include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results towards potential replicators across the EU.
Applicants should refer to the part D and E of the General Annexes to this Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. The funding rate for Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions (PPI) actions is limited to 35% of the total eligible costs (PPI is procurement for the purchase and deployment of innovative solutions) to leverage co-financing from the procurers.
Expected Impact:
For PPI actions, proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below (wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets):
Prepare and implement the PPI procurement and PPI contracts within the timeframe of the project to ensure the first application / commercialisation of the innovative solutions.
Energy performance levels of new buildings should be at least 25% better than current regulations or reach NZEB performance levels. For existing buildings, energy savings of at least 60% compared to the existing building should be reached, using innovative solutions. Products and services, should demonstrate at least 25% better performance in terms of energy efficiency than the available performance levels.

The challenge for the European industry is to develop a global technological leadership in energy efficiency solutions. The EU-funding alone will not be sufficient to ensure an increase in energy efficiency in the process industry by 20% in 2020 and to radically reduce the energy content of production, leading to more flexible, less costly manufacturing processes and for self-consumption. Therefore the Member States and Associated Countries are invited through this action to identify Joint Actions in this field, to implement joint activities, and to systemically address the non-technology barriers for wider uptake of energy efficiency.
Scope:
The proposed ERA-NET action aims at development and launch of a joint call for proposals in the field of energy efficiency in Industry and Services. Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. The joint call should focus around a limited number of industrial sectors, not covered under SPIRE. The projects financed by the joint call should cover either industrial sectors with very energy intensive industrial processes or industrial sectors with large energy consumption due to their market presence, though their industrial processes are not highly energy intensive. Further, they should cover industrial sectors with innovative potential and willingness/readiness to implement energy efficiency measures at a meaningful scale. Finally, the size of the addressed industrial sectors in EU and/or their benefits for the EU economy need to be taken into account. The joint call should address Innovation Actions and include the elements related to persistent market barriers. Proposals should demonstrate how the proposed activities will be continued commercially beyond the project lifetime. Involvement of relevant multiplier organisations is encouraged. The ERA-NET action will be implemented according to the three reporting periods scheme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The ERA-NET action will indicate the specific impact resulting from the transnational nature of the action and the European added value. Deliverables of each of the projects financed by the joint call will be included in the reports of the ERA-NET action to the European Commission. The projects financed by the joint call are expected to demonstrate the impacts in terms of primary energy savings triggered by the project within its duration (in GWh/year per million Euro of EU funding). They are also expected to contribute to the objectives of the EU Energy Efficiency policies and initiatives. Finally, they will include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice, which could be used to assess the progress during the ERA-NET action life time.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Following the increasing demand for cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, dematerialization of documents and other ICT services, the demand for ICT processing is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Data centres should become more energy efficient and should maximise integration of renewable energy sources. Intermittent renewable energy sources need to be combined with energy storage (electricity or cold/heat) to ensure efficient and secure energy management in data centres. In addition, existing and new data centres should be better integrated into the various energy grids (electricity and/or heat) in order to turn their energy use and waste into a benefit for the whole energy system. Previous research activities in this area have identified a wide array of innovative solutions and concepts. However, further research and development activities are needed to bring them to the market. Speeding up the time-to-market of these promising solutions is the main challenge under this topic.
Scope:
Innovation Actions are needed to increase the energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources and integration of data centres in the energy system. Proposals should cover several following areas: innovative and energy efficient cooling solutions, waste heat reuse, geographical and temporal workload balance, integration of local and remote renewable energy sources, integration in smart grids, integration with district heating/cooling networks, integration of power backup system in the grid and use of heat pumps for efficient use of waste heat etc. Proposals should include the development of business models to trade heat, cold, electricity or energy security and storage. Proposals should build upon the results of previous projects such as the ones funded under the FP7-Smartcities Call 2013 (namely RenewIT, DC4Cities, Dolfin, Genic, GreenDataNet, GEYSER). Proposals should focus on new and existing data centres (indicatively from 500 kW to 1 MW IT load).

Specific challenge: GÉANT is recognised as the European communications commons that supports the rise of compute- and data-intensive collaborative research and education through innovative services, operational excellence and global reach. There is a clear need to further develop and maintain GÉANT in this role.
Scope: GÉANT will:
(1) Provide cost-effective and reliable services for very high-speed connectivity, identity inter-federation, resource virtualisation, mobility and trust in order to support knowledge communities, ensuring digital continuum of services to users anywhere in the EU.
(2) Enable talent anywhere in the world to cooperate with their peers in Europe through interoperable services, as well as extend beyond the traditional researcher base into wider public services where appropriate.
(3) Advance the state-of-the-art of the communication commons by constant development of both innovative multi-domain services and their use, and by translating this innovation into a competitive European ICT sector, for instance through: specific open calls; pre-commercial procurement; public-private partnerships between industry, academia and user communities to develop, experiment with or validate novel technologies in the telecom and internet domains; and exploring with industry possibilities of service provisioning through aggregation of demand and brokerage, new business models, best practices or coordination.
(4) Cope with the changing environment by structuring the governance of the European communications commons for accountability, measurability, transparency and sustainability; focusing on flexible services geared towards users; stimulating development of GÉANT's human capital (including training and exchange schemes); and aligning the regulatory, standardisation and policy framework to enable full exploitation of the communications commons.
GÉANT should provide core and basic operation services including identity federation, in coordination with other e-infrastructure providers to promote interoperability and a seamless user experience.
The long-term cooperation between the Commission and the selected consortium will be formalised within a Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) covering the duration of Horizon 2020[1] to provide a stable environment for the implementation of GÉANT as the European communication commons and with an indicative average yearly EU funding of EUR 25 million per year[2]. This agreement shall specify the common objectives, the nature of actions planned and the general rights and obligations of each party..
Within this framework, the Commission intends to award Specific Grants[3] to the selected consortium, in order to implement the action plan agreed in the FPA, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the FPA (see also section on ""Other actions"").
Expected impact: By 2020 GÉANT is the European communications commons where talent anywhere is able to collaborate with their peers around the world and have instantaneous and unlimited access to any resource for knowledge creation, innovation and learning, unconstrained by the barriers of the pre-digital and the present digital world. Europe is the hub for research networking excellence world-wide. The GÉANT governance is able to cope with the changing environment and the GÉANT community collaborates intensively with European industry and academia, produces innovative solutions grounded on business needs and drives the internet evolution.
Type of action: Framework Partnership Agreement with multiple beneficiaries (no funding) providing a framework for Specific Grants
[1]  As per Article 178 of the Rules of Application of the Financial Regulation and Article 16(6) of the Rules for Participation

ERASMUS+ TEACHER ACADEMIES
The 2019 Council Resolution on further developing the European Education Area invites the Commission to “Develop new means to train and support competent, motivated and highly qualified teachers, trainers, educators and school leaders, and promote their continuous professional development and high-quality, research-based teacher education.” The 2019 European Education Summit also stressed the crucial importance of teachers, and the role of teachers was identified in the consultations on the future cooperation framework as one of the most important topics to be addressed in EU cooperation.
The Council Conclusions on European Teacher and Trainers for the Future of May 2020 reiterate the role of teachers as cornerstones of the European Education Area and call for further support to teachers’ career and competence development as well as well-being at all stages of their careers. The Conclusions stress the benefits of mobility of teachers and the need of embedding mobility as part of teachers’ initial and continuous education. Moreover, the Conclusions invite the Commission to support closer cooperation between teacher education providers within the continuum of teachers’ professional development.
The 2020 Commission’s Communication on Achieving the European Education Area by 2025 recognises the key role of teachers and trainers and sets the vision of having highly competent and motivated educators who can benefit from a range of support and professional development opportunities throughout their varied careers. It proposes a number of actions to address the challenges the teaching professions face today, including the plan to launch Erasmus+ Teacher Academies.
The Commission’s Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) stresses the need to ensure that all teachers and trainers have the confidence and competences to use technology effectively and creatively to engage and motivate their learners as well as to ensure that all learners develop their digital competences for learning, living and working in an ever more digitalised world.
All EU countries express a desire to improve the attractiveness of the profession: in the EU countries participating in OECD’s TALIS survey, on average, less than 20% of lower secondary school teachers felt that their profession is valued by the society. The ageing of the teaching professionals is a concern as upcoming waves of retirement could result in potential shortages in the teaching workforce in a country. The 2019 Education and Training Monitor indicates also that a number of European countries face serious shortages of teachers, either across the board or in some subjects such as science, or in specific profiles such as teaching pupils with special needs.
Despite wide offer of continuous professional development, teachers still self-report a lack of professional development opportunities according to the OECD’s TALIS survey. Despite the benefits of mobility, it is still not embedded in teacher education effectively, due to many practical obstacles that should be removed by more consistent policies.
The Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will address these issues, complement other work done in achieving the Education Area, and help transfer the results to national and regional policy making and eventually to teacher education and support for schools. They will build on the innovations and effective practice that exists within national teacher education and European cooperation and develop them further. Specific attention will be paid to dissemination and exploitation of effective practice across countries and teacher education providers, and to ensuring feedback and impact also at policy level.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
The overall objective of this action is to create European partnerships of teacher education and training providers to set up Erasmus+ Teacher Academies that will develop a European and international outlook in teacher education. These Academies will embrace multilingualism and cultural diversity, develop teacher education in line with the EU’s priorities in education policy and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the European Education Area.
The Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will meet the following objectives:
Contribute to the improvement of teacher education policies and practices in Europe by creating networks and communities of practice on teacher education that bring together providers of initial teacher education (pre-service education for future teachers) and providers of continuing professional development (in-service), other relevant actors such as teacher association, ministries and stakeholders to develop and test strategies and programmes for professional learning that is effective, accessible and transferable to other contexts.
Enhance the European dimension and internationalisation of teacher education through innovative and practical collaboration with teacher educators and teachers in other European countries and by sharing experiences for the further development of teacher education in Europe. This collaboration will address the key priorities of the European Union such as learning in the digital world, sustainability, equity and inclusion, also by offering teachers courses, modules and other learning opportunities on these topics.
Develop and test jointly different models of mobility (virtual, physical and blended) in initial teacher education and as part of teachers’ continuous professional development in order to enhance the quality and number of mobility as well as to make mobility an integral part of teacher education provision in Europe.
Develop sustainable collaboration between teacher education providers with an impact to the quality of teacher education in Europe and with a view to inform teacher education polices at European and national levels.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
Each Erasmus+ Teacher Academy shall implement a coherent and comprehensive set of activities, such as:
Collaborate and establish networks and communities of practice with teacher education providers, teacher associations, public organisations involved in teacher education and other relevant actors to create innovative strategies and programmes for initial and continuous professional development for teachers and schools.
Develop and deliver joint, innovative and effective learning modules on teacher education and for teacher competences on challenging and/or new pedagogical matters of common concern. They shall address the distinct needs of student teachers (as part of their initial education) and serving teachers (as part of continuous professional development).
Develop joint learning offer with a strong European dimension that includes mobility activities in all its forms, setting up, for instance summer schools, study visits for students and teachers as well as other forms of cross-campus collaboration, both physical and virtual.
Identify effective ways to remove obstacles of mobility and identify conditions, including practical arrangements and recognition of learning, in order to increase the number and quality of mobility and its inclusion as an integral part of initial and continuous learning offer for teachers.
Involve schools and in particular training schools to experiment and share innovative new ways of teaching (including for distance and blended approaches to teaching and learning).
Undertake, in line with the objectives of this call, studies, research and/or surveys or collections of effective practices to produce summaries, discussion papers, recommendations etc. to stimulate discussion and to inform policies on teacher education.
Promote and give preference to the existing Erasmus+ tools, such as eTwinning and School Education Gateway, for virtual mobility, collaboration, communication for testing and sharing results.
EXPECTED IMPACT
The development of the Erasmus+ Teacher Academies is expected to improve the attractiveness of the teaching profession and to ensure high-quality initial education and continuous professional development for teachers, educators and school leaders.
Erasmus+ Teacher Academies are expected to enhance the European dimension and internationalisation of teacher education by creating European partnerships of teacher education and training providers. The close collaboration between relevant actors across European borders envisages innovative European cooperation and substantial development of teacher education policies and practices, building upon the existing innovations and effective practices within national teacher education systems and on the joint learning offer organized for participating teachers. This approach is expected to pave the way to make mobility an integral part of teacher education provision in Europe, by removing actual obstacles to mobility and by identifying conditions for successful mobility strategies and programmes.
Operating at national and European level, the Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will form strong and sustained partnerships between providers of initial teacher education and continuing professional development. They will provide closer co-cooperation between teacher education providers, paving the way towards structural partnerships and joint programmes between institutions. Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will thereby ensure high quality, effective initial and continuous professional development and achieve results that would be difficult to obtain without knowledge sharing and effective cooperation.
Through the use of various dissemination channels at transnational, national and/or regional levels as well as the deployment of a long-term action plan for the progressive roll-out of project deliverables, projects are expected to engage relevant stakeholders within and outside the participating organisations and ensure a lasting impact also after the project lifetime.

Deadline date","Scope:
Alliances for Innovation aim to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity by boosting innovation through cooperation and flow of knowledge among higher education, vocational education and training (both initial and continuous), and the broader socio-economic environment, including research.
They also aim to boost the provision of new skills and address skills mismatches by designing and creating new curricula for higher education (HE) and vocational education and training (VET), supporting the development of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets in the EU.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
These partnerships shall implement a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities, which should be adaptable to future knowledge developments across the EU.
To boost innovation, the focus will be on digital skills as they are increasingly important in all job profiles across the entire labour market. Also, the transition to a circular and greener economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging professional needs for green skills and sustainable development.
Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills (implementing the ‘Blueprint’) (European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience: https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1223) aim to create new strategic approaches and cooperation for concrete skills development solutions – both in the short and the medium term – in given economic sectors, or in areas implementing a major action of the European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience, the Pact for Skills. The main objective of the Pact is to mobilise and incentivize all relevant stakeholders to take concrete actions for the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce, by pooling efforts and setting up partnerships, also at EU level addressing the needs of the labour market, supporting green and digital transitions as well as national, regional and local skills and growth strategies. Therefore, the deliverables of Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills, i.e. sectoral skills intelligence, skills strategies, occupational profiles, training programmes, and long-term planning, will be an important contribution to the work of the sectoral partnerships that have joined the Pact for Skills.
Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills seek to tackle skills gaps on the labour market that hamper growth, innovation and competitiveness in specific sectors or areas, aiming both at short term interventions and long term strategies. These Alliances will be implemented in the 14 industrial ecosystems identified in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe (COM/2020/102 final: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0102) (see eligibility criteria).
The Pact for Skills builds on and absorbs the Blueprint for sectoral cooperation on skills. Therefore, Alliances under Lot 2 will support the implementation of the Pact by developing a sectoral skills strategy. This strategy has to lead to systemic and structural impact on reducing skills shortages, gaps and mismatches, as well as ensuring appropriate quality and levels of skills. The sectoral skills strategy must include a clear set of activities, milestones and well-defined objectives with the goal to match demand and supply of skills to support the overall sector-specific growth strategy. The Alliances aim to build the base for the Pact for Skills and define the pathway that should be continued after the project is finalised.
Drawing on evidence regarding skills needs with regard to occupational profiles, Blueprint Alliances support the design and delivery of transnational education & training content, as well as teaching and training methodologies, for quick take-up at regional and local level and for new occupations that are emerging.
Proposals should include the design of continuing vocational training programmes to address urgent skills needs of people in working age. Proposals should also include developments of emerging occupational profiles, related qualifications, which should cover upper and post-secondary VET levels (EQF levels 3 to 5) and tertiary levels (EQF levels 6 to 8). Furthermore, proposals should include the design of related core curricula and education and training programmes leading to those qualifications.
Each project must include among its partners both vocational education and training (VET) and higher education (HE) organisations and labour market actors. Ideally they also involve policy bodies, certifying bodies as well as European sectoral associations and representatives of industry.

Gathering skills intelligence on a continuous basis: delivering relevant EU and country and/or regional level qualitative evidence and quantitative data according to linked open data format; developing a common methodology for anticipating future skills needs as well as monitoring (on a yearly basis) progress and the evolution of the demand and supply of skills based on credible foresight scenarios, drawing on the EU Skills Panorama and, where relevant, the work of the OECD, the World Economic Forum and existing Sector Skills Alliances;
Mapping of existing upskilling and reskilling support available in the sector/ecosystem (provided by industry, public and private stakeholders) and identifying which of those actions could be upscaled to support companies in the value chains;
Based on the skills intelligence, developing a skills strategy for the industrial ecosystem including priorities for actions to support the objectives of re- and upskilling the workforce of the industrial ecosystem and those who could join the sector (e.g. economically inactive). The strategy should detail how major trends, such as global, societal, and technological developments in the industrial ecosystem, are likely to affect jobs and skills needs. It should describe the expected timeline and give particular attention to the impact of digital and key enabling technologies. It should identify and define occupations and related skills that are likely to emerge in the sector (i.e. will be completely new). It should also identify key industrial players and stakeholders that should be involved in the implementation of the strategy. This strategy should be the one of the first key deliverable of the project, indicating a clear set of activities, milestones and well-defined outputs, as well as setting out concrete priority actions suggesting how to match future demand and supply of skills for these emerging occupations. The strategy should be used as a base for building the partnership under the Pact for Skills;
Where relevant, ensuring that results of the project are available in open data format so that they can feed into the EU Skills Panorama and the European Skills, Competencies, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO);
Delivering relevant EU and country and/or regional level qualitative evidence and quantitative data according to linked open data format.
Designing European sector-wide agreed ‘core’ curricula and training programmes
Within the first year of activity (reactive response)
In parallel to the actions above, all projects should rapidly address urgent skills needs in occupations in an industrial
ecosystem resulting from the Covid-19 crisis and the digital and green transition (evidence to be provided in the proposal):
Drawing on, where available, the occupational profiles of the Classification of ESCO and existing competence frameworks (E.g. the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens, the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework and the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF));
Designing continuing vocational training programmes for up-skilling and re-skilling the labour force by innovative blended and work-based learning;
Ensuring the good quality of the content and provision of the new training programmes by applying quality assurance methods in line with EQAVET and ESG (European Standards & Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Higher Education);
Ensuring rapid uptake and use of the training programmes by reaching out to main players in value chains within the industrial ecosystem, to Centres of Vocational Excellence (https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1501), to regions implementing smart specialisation strategies (https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home), to European Cluster Partnerships (https://www.clustercollaboration.eu) and to Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Technology (EIT) (https://eit.europa.eu/) that are active in the same industrial ecosystem.
Throughout the project (proactive response).
Projects should then work on developing training content for emerging occupational profiles:
On the basis of identified skills needs for emerging occupational profiles in an industrial ecosystem given economic sector, designing new modular VET curricula and related qualifications for initial education & training (E&T) (full curricula for integration in national education & training systems), and continuing vocational training programmes for up-skilling or re-skilling the people of working age (modules addressing emerging skills needs);
These curricula and training programmes shall be composed of units of learning outcomes, in line with the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) / National Qualifications Frameworks (NQFs) and informed by ESCO; curricula should deliver job-specific skills as well as key competences (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2018.189.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:C:2018:189:TOC), that include notably transversal skills and STEAM disciplines (Science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics);
Integrating periods of work-based learning into the new training content, including opportunities to apply knowledge in practical ""real life"" workplace situations, and embedding trans-national learning experience whenever possible;
Applying quality management to the new training content either by applying the quality assurance principles of EQAVET and ESG or by using already existing quality assurance systems which, however, should be in line with EQAVET and ESG;
Promoting relevant sectoral qualifications including trans-national joint programmes awarded by more than one E&T provider, thus facilitating cross-border certification, and building mutual trust, contributing to increased learner and professional mobility in the sector.
Delivering the ‘core’ curricula and training programmes
Developing delivery methodologies for the curricula and training programmes, that are adapted to the various target groups, using innovative approaches to teaching and learning, including the provision of work-based learning, the use of ICTs (e.g. blended learning, simulators, augmented reality, etc.), virtual/blended mobility solutions for learners and staff, and open educational resources (e.g. AI-enhanced learning, MOOC´s (MOOC is a Massive Open Online Course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. In addition to traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets, many MOOCs provide interactive user forums to support community interactions among students, professors, and teaching assistants.));
Developing actions to facilitate inter-generational transfer of professional knowledge;
Describing the ways in which assessment methodologies and procedures can cover all forms of learning, including work-based learning, and facilitate the validation of skills and competences acquired prior to training;
Building on established contacts and on new contacts established with the skills demand side during the skills intelligence phase, reaching out to providers of employment opportunities, such as private and public employers and employment services, for potential matching with training graduates;
Identifying adequate measures to track learners after completing their training in order to provide ""feedback loops"" (See Medium-term deliverable 2 (MTD2), in 2015 Riga Conclusions: https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail /-/publication/200c516d-b8de-4c2aa233-218671296c8d/language-en). These tracking and feedback systems can build on information from companies, learners/employees, as well as public information resources and labour market stakeholders;
Proposing the appropriate measures for the formal recognition of the new or adapted vocational VET and HE curricula and qualifications in the countries where partners are located and in the industrial ecosystem covered.
Designing a long term action plan for the progressive roll-out of project deliverables after the project has finished
This plan shall be based on sustained partnerships between education and training providers, key industry stakeholders and public authorities (regional or national) at the appropriate level to facilitate/strengthen multi-stakeholder skills partnerships under the Pact for Skills for re- and upskilling the workforce. It should include the identification of appropriate governance structures, as well as plans for scalability and financial sustainability;
The plan shall ensure the appropriate visibility and wide dissemination of the results, including at EU and national/regional political level and include details on how the roll-out will be implemented at national and/or regional levels with relevant public authorities;
The plan shall foresee how the deliverables of the project, in particular the skills intelligence, the strategy and the training programmes, will be updated following the end of the 4 year duration of the project, including by foreseeing its future sources of funding;
The plan shall indicate how EU funding opportunities (e.g. recovery and resilience facility (RRF), EU multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, including European Structural Funds, InvestEU, Erasmus+), as well as private investment and national/regional funding can support skills strategies. This should take into account Smart Specialisation Strategies, European cluster partnerships, the platforms of Centres of Vocational Excellence and the Innovation Communities of the EIT.
Alliances for Innovation are required to apply EU wide instruments and tools, such as the EQF, ESCO, Europass, EQAVET
and ESG, whenever relevant. To try and test new curricula or new training and learning methods, Alliances for Innovation may organise learning mobility activities of students, teachers, researchers and staff in so far as they support/complement the main activities of the partnerships and bring added value in the implementation of the project's objectives.
EXPECTED IMPACT
Alliances for Innovation will be anchored in strategic and sustainable cooperation among vocational education and training, higher education and enterprises working together to boost the innovation capacity of Europe. They will considerably strengthen the synergies between both educational fields in fostering innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets. These Alliances among HE, VET and the enterprises are expected to contribute to the development of regional eco-systems and directly provide a valuable input to the economy, integrating workbased learning. While universities have research knowledge and data that allows them to directly provide input to small and medium sized enterprises to boost local economies, VET providers supply skills needed by enterprises and they are able to foster growth in the local economy.
At a larger scale, Alliances for Innovation are expected to target societal and economic challenges, both in education and employment, and take into account key areas such as innovation challenges, skills provision, climate change, green economy, demography, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Benefits can also be drawn from cooperation with large enterprises. The Alliances for Innovation will focus on the need of citizens and accelerate the modernization of HE and VET.
The Pact for Skills will not only establish a framework for the implementation of the other actions of the updated Skills Agenda, but also for the dissemination and exploitation of the project results of the Alliances for Innovation. In particular the results of the Blueprint Alliances for sectoral cooperation on skills will be used as a basis for the Pact for Skills sectoral large-scale partnerships.
In addition, the Alliances will help to implement the EU Communication on the Renewed Agenda for Higher Education (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017DC0247) and contribute to the creation of a European Education Area (https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area_en). They will also contribute to implement the EU Industrial and SMEs strategies (2021).
The Alliances for Innovation will also take into account the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and the Paris Declaration on Climate Change (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) as overarching parameters of the action, thus helping the European Commission to implement its new Green Deal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/european-green-deal-communication_en.pdf) and the Europe Recovery Plan (https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en).
Alliances for Innovation are meant to have a short and long term impact on the wider range of stakeholders involved, at individual, organisational and systemic level. This impact is expected to go beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations involved in the partnerships. It is expected that partnership and activities persist. For that, results/deliverables might not be stand-alone but be linked to/integrated into existing undertakings, schemes, projects, platforms, ventures etc.
AWARD CRITERIA
Relevance of the project (maximum score 25 points)
Link to EU policy and initiatives: the proposal takes into account and contributes to achieving the European objectives in the field of HE and VET and sectoral EU policies relevant for chosen industrial ecosystem, contributes to the Pact for Skills and the European Skills Agenda and takes into account EU tools. A proposal addressing an industrial ecosystem in which a Blueprint Alliance is already ongoing in that ecosystem must clearly be complementary, i.e. cover a clearly different field, and must specify what results of ongoing Blueprint project/s it will build on; there must not be any overlaps in scope, outputs and activities. At equal quality, a proposal covering an ecosystem or part of an ecosystem that is not covered by an ongoing Blueprint Alliance will be more relevant;

For Lot 2: Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills (implementing the ‘Blueprint’) only 1 proposal per ecosystem can be funded.
To be considered for funding, proposals must score at least 70 points taking into account the necessary minimum pass score for each of the four award criteria: minimum 13 points for the “relevance of the project” category; 16 points for “quality of the project design and implementation”, 13 points for “quality of the partnership and the cooperation arrangements” and 11 points for “impact”.
WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?
This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call.
The maximum EU grant per project is as follows:
4 million euros (4 years project) - only one proposal per industrial ecosystem can be selected for funding.
At equal quality, a proposal covering an ecosystem that is not at all covered by an ongoing Blueprint Alliance will be assessed as more relevant.
How is the project lump sum determined?
Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following
points:
a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into ‘project management’, ‘training’, ‘organization of events’, ‘mobility preparation and implementation’, ‘communication and dissemination’, ‘quality assurance’, etc.);
b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the estimated costs showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);
d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such us dissemination of information, publishing or translation).
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.
Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out.
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.
The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.
More details are described in the model Grant Agreement available in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP)."

CENTRES OF VOCATIONAL EXCELLENCE
The initiative on Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVEs) defines a bottom-up approach to excellence where institutions for vocational education and training (VET) are capable of rapidly adapting skills provision to evolving economic and social needs. It aims to foster transnational collaborative platforms, which would be difficult for isolated member states to establish in the absence of EU incentives, technical support, and mutual learning opportunities. The concept of vocational excellence that is proposed is characterised by a learner-centred holistic approach in which Vocational Education and Training:
Is an integrative part of skills ecosystems, contributing to regional development, innovation, inclusion, and smart specialisation strategies;
Is part of knowledge triangles, working closely with other education and training sectors, the scientific community, and business;
Enables learners to acquire vocational and key competences through high-quality provision that is underpinned by quality assurance, builds innovative forms of partnerships with the world of work, and is supported by the continuous professional development of teaching and training staff, innovative and inclusive pedagogies, mobility and internationalisation strategies.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
This action supports the gradual establishment and development of European platforms of Centres of Vocational Excellence, contributing to regional development, innovation, and smart specialisation strategies as well as to international collaborative platforms. Centres of Vocational Excellence will operate at two levels:
1. At national level in a given local context, by embedding CoVEs closely in the local innovation ecosystems, and connecting them at European level.
2. At transnational level through platforms of Centres of Vocational Excellence to establish world-class reference points for vocational training by bringing together CoVEs that share:
a common interest in specific sectors (e.g. aeronautics, e-mobility, green and circular technologies, ICT, healthcare, etc.) or
innovative approaches to tackle societal challenges (e.g. climate change, resource depletion and scarcity, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, Sustainable Development Goals, integration of migrants, upskilling people with low qualification levels, etc.).
The platforms aim for ""upward convergence"" of VET excellence. They will be open for the involvement of countries with well-developed vocational excellence systems, as well as those in the process of developing similar approaches, aimed at exploring the full potential of VET institutions to play a proactive role in support of growth and innovation.
CoVEs are intended for organisations providing vocational education and training, at any EQF levels from 3 to 8, including the upper-secondary level, the post-secondary non-tertiary level as well as the tertiary level (e.g. Universities of applied sciences, Polytechnic institutes, etc.).
However, applications cannot include only activities that target learners at tertiary level; applications that focus on VET at tertiary level (EQF levels 6 to 8) must include at least one other VET qualification level between EQF levels 3 to 5, as well as a strong work-based learning component.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
In order to be eligible for an Erasmus+ grant, project proposals for Centres for Vocational Excellence must comply with the following criteria:
Who can apply?
Any participating organisation legally established in a Programme Country can be the applicant. This organisation applies on behalf of all participating organisations involved in the project.
What types of organisations are eligible to participate in the project?
Any public or private organisation active in the field of vocational education and training, or in the world of work and legally established in a Programme country or in any Partner Country can be involved as full partner, affiliated entity or associated partner. For example, such organisations can be (non-exhaustive list):
VET providers
Companies, industry or sector representative organisations
National/regional qualification authorities

SETTING UP A PROJECT
Centres of Vocational Excellence are characterized by adopting a systemic approach. They are expected to go far beyond the simple provision of a quality vocational qualification. Features that characterise transnational cooperation platforms include a set of various activities grouped under the three clusters mentioned below:
1. Teaching and learning – including providing people with skills relevant to the labour market, in a lifelong learning continuum approach; developing innovative learner-centred teaching and learning methodologies including distance learning resources developing modular and learner-centred transnational VET learning provision (curricula and/or qualifications) thus facilitating the mobility (including virtual mobility) of learners and staff, as well as the recognition at regional and/or national levels.
2. Cooperation and partnerships – including contributing to the creation and dissemination of new knowledge in partnership with other stakeholders; and establishing business-education partnerships for apprenticeships, internships, sharing of equipment, including resources for distance learning, exchanges of staff and teachers between companies and VET centres, etc.
3. Governance and funding – including ensuring effective governance at all levels involving relevant stakeholders; and making full use of EU financial instruments and funds. A non exhaustive list of activities corresponding to each cluster is presented in the Application Form. The activities proposed in the project applications should bring an added value and will have a direct impact on the achievement of the project results.
The project must include relevant deliverables linked to:
at least 3 of the activities listed in the Application Form under Cluster 1 - Teaching and learning,
at least 3 of the activities listed in the Application Form under Cluster 2 - Cooperation and partnership, and
at least 2 of the activities listed in the Application Form under Cluster 3 - Governance and funding.
The applicant can include activities that are not listed under the three clusters above. These must demonstrate that they are particularly appropriate to meet the objectives of the call and identified needs, and must be considered and presented as part of a coherent set of activities.
CoVEs are not intended to build new VET institutions and infrastructure from scratch (although they may also do so), but instead to bring together a set of local/regional partners, such as initial and continuing VET providers, tertiary education institutions including universities of applied sciences and polytechnics, research institutions, companies, chambers, social partners, national and regional authorities and development agencies, public employment services, etc.
Projects are required to apply EU wide instruments and tools whenever relevant.
Projects must include the design of a long-term action plan for the progressive roll-out of project deliverables after the project has finished. This plan shall be based on sustained partnerships between education and training providers and key industry stakeholders at the appropriate level. It should include the identification of appropriate governance structures, as well as plans for scalability and financial sustainability. It should also ensure the appropriate visibility and wide dissemination of the work of the platforms, including at EU and national political level and include details on how the roll-out will be implemented at European, national and/or regional levels with relevant partners. The action plan shall also indicate how EU funding opportunities (e.g. European Structural Funds, European Fund for Strategic Investment, Erasmus+, COSME, sectoral programmes), and national and regional funding (as well as private funding), can support the roll-out of the project. This should take into account national and regional smart specialisation strategies.
EXPECTED IMPACT
The gradual establishment and development of European platforms of Centres of Vocational Excellence is expected to increase the attractiveness of vocational education and training and to ensure that it is at the forefront of providing solutions to the challenges posed by rapidly changing skills needs.
By forming an essential part of the “knowledge triangle” – the close collaboration between businesses, education and research – and playing a fundamental role in providing skills to support innovation and smart specialisation, the Centres of Vocational Excellence are expected to ensure high quality skills and competences that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, which meet the needs of an innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy. This approach is expected to pave the way for VET to act within a more comprehensive and inclusive conceptualisation of skills provision, addressing innovation, pedagogy, social justice, life-long learning, transversal skills, organisational and continuing professional learning and community needs.
By being firmly anchored within regional/local contexts while at the same time operating at transnational level, the Centres of Vocational Excellence will form strong and enduring partnerships between the VET community and the world of work at national level and across borders. They will thereby ensure the continuous relevance of skills provision and achieve results that would be difficult to obtain without knowledge sharing and sustained cooperation.
Through the wide dissemination of project outcomes at transnational, national and/or regional levels and the development of a long term action plan for the progressive roll out of project deliverables, taking national and regional smart specialisation strategies into account, individual projects are expected to engage relevant stakeholders within and outside the participating organisations and ensure a lasting impact after the project lifetime.

The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call.
The maximum EU grant per project is 4 million euros
How is the project lump sum determined?
Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following points:
a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into ‘project management’, ‘training’, ‘organization of events’, ‘mobility preparation and implementation’, ‘communication and dissemination’, ‘quality assurance’, etc.);
b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the lump sum showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);
d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such as dissemination of information, publishing or translation).
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action.
Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.
The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The primary goal of Cooperation Partnerships is to allow organisations to increase the quality and relevance of their activities, to develop and reinforce their networks of partners, to increase their capacity to operate jointly at transnational level, boosting internationalisation of their activities and through exchanging or developing new practices and methods as well as sharing and confronting ideas. They aim to support the development, transfer and/or implementation of innovative practices as well as the implementation of joint initiatives promoting cooperation, peer learning and exchanges of experience at European level. Results should be re-usable, transferable, up-scalable and, if possible, have a strong transdisciplinary dimension. Selected projects will be expected to share the results of their activities at local, regional, national level and transnational level. Cooperation Partnerships are anchored to the priorities and policy frameworks of each Erasmus+ sector, both at European and national level, while aiming at producing incentives for cross-sectoral and horizontal cooperation in thematic areas.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
Cooperation Partnerships aim at:
Increasing quality in the work, activities and practices of organisations and institutions involved, opening up to new actors, not naturally included within one sector;
Building capacity of organisations to work transnationally and across sectors;
Addressing common needs and priorities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport;
Enabling transformation and change (at individual, organisational or sectoral level), leading to improvements and new approaches, in proportion to the context of each organisation;
WHICH ARE THE CRITERIA TO BE MET TO APPLY FOR A COOPERATION PARTNERSHIP?
In order to be eligible for an Erasmus+ grant, project proposals for Cooperation Partnerships must comply with the following criteria:
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Who can apply?
Any participating organisation established in a Programme Country can be the applicant. This organisation applies on behalf of all participating organisations involved in the project.
For a definition of what is considered as a European NGO for the purpose of the Erasmus+ Programme, please see “Part D – Glossary” of the Programme Guide.
The same consortium of partners can submit only one application and to one Agency only per deadline.
Which types of organisations are eligible to participate in the project?
Any public or private organisation, established in a Programme Country or in any Partner Country of the world (see section “Eligible Countries” in Part A of the Programme Guide) can participate in a Cooperation Partnership. Organisations established in Programme Countries can either participate as the coordinator of the project or as a partner organisation. Organisations in Partner Countries cannot participate as project coordinators.
Irrespective of the field impacted by the project, Cooperation Partnerships are open to any type of organisation active in any field of education, training, youth, sport or other socio-economic sectors as well as to organisations carrying out activities that are transversal to different fields (e.g. local, regional and national authorities, recognition and validation centres, chambers of commerce, trade organisations, guidance centres, cultural and sport organisations).
Depending on the priority and the objectives addressed by the project, Cooperation Partnerships should involve the most appropriate and diverse range of partners in order to benefit from their different experiences, profiles and specific expertise and to produce relevant and high quality project results.
Participation of associated partner organisations
In addition to the organisations formally participating in the project (the coordinator and partner organisations), Cooperation Partnerships may also involve other partners from the public or private sector that contribute to the implementation of specific project tasks/activities or support the promotion and sustainability of the project.
Within an Erasmus+ project, these partners will be called “associated partners”. For eligibility and contractual management aspects they are not considered to be project partners, and they do not receive any funding from the Programme as part of the project. However, in order to understand their role within the partnership and have a global picture about the proposal, their involvement in the project and in the different activities needs to be clearly described in the project proposal.
Number and profile of participating organisations
A Cooperation Partnership is a transnational project and involves minimum three organisations from three different Programme Countries.
There is no maximum number of participating organisations in one partnership.
All participating organisations must be identified at the time of applying for a grant.
As a general rule, Cooperation Partnerships target the cooperation between organisations established in Programme Countries. However, organisations from Partner Countries can be involved as partners (not as applicants), if their participation brings an essential added value to the project.
Priorities addressed
To be considered for funding, Cooperation Partnerships must address either:
at least one horizontal priority and/or
at least one specific priority relevant to the field of education, training that is mostly impacted.
Venue of the activities
All the activities of a Cooperation Partnership must take place in the countries of the organisations participating in the project, either as full or as associated partners.
In addition, if duly justified in relation to the objectives or implementation of the project:
Activities can also take place at the seat of an Institution of the European Union, even if in the project there are no participating organisations from the country that hosts the Institution.
Activities involving sharing and promotion of results can also take place at relevant thematic transnational events/conferences in Programme or Partner Countries.
Duration of project
Between 12 and 36 months.
The duration has to be chosen at application stage, based on the objectives of the project and on the type of activities planned over time.
The duration of a Cooperation Partnership may be extended, upon justified request by the beneficiary and with the agreement of Executive Agency, provided that the total duration does not exceed 36 months. In such a case, the total grant will not change.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
A Cooperation Partnership project consists of four stages, which start even before the project proposal is selected for funding: planning, preparation, implementation and follow-up. Participating organisations and participants involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages and thus enhancing their learning experience.
Planning (define the needs, objectives, project and learning outcomes, activity formats, schedule etc.);
preparation (planning of the activities, development of work programme, practical arrangements, confirmation of the target group(s) of envisaged activities, set up of agreements with partners etc.);
implementation of activities;
follow-up (evaluation of the activities and their impact at different levels, sharing and use of the project's results).
Horizontal aspects to be considered when designing your project:
In addition to complying with the formal criteria and setting up sustainable cooperation arrangement with all project partners, the following elements can contribute to increasing the impact and qualitative implementation of Cooperation Partnerships throughout the different project phases. Applicants are encouraged to take these opportunities and dimensions into account when designing Cooperation Partnership projects.
Environmental sustainability
Projects should be designed in an eco-friendly way and should incorporate green practices in all its facets. Organisations and participants should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing the project, which will encourage everyone involved in the project to discuss and learn about environmental issues, reflecting about what can be done at different levels and help organisations and participants come up with alternative, greener ways of implementing project activities.
Inclusion and Diversity
The Erasmus+ Programme seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness across all its actions. To implement these principles, an Inclusion and Diversity Strategy has been devised to support a better outreach to participants from more diverse backgrounds, in particular those with fewer opportunities facing obstacles to participate in European Projects. Organisations should design accessible and inclusive project activities, taking into account the views of participants with fewer opportunities and involving them in decision making throughout the whole process.
Digital dimension
Virtual cooperation and experimentation with virtual and blended learning opportunities are key to successful Cooperation Partnerships. In particular, projects in the field of school education and adult education are strongly encouraged to use the eTwinning, the School Education Gateway and the EPALE Platforms to work together before, during and after the project activities.
Sector specific priorities
In the field of higher education:
Priority will be given to actions that are key to achieving the objectives of the European Education Area. The aim is to support the higher education sector in becoming even more inter-connected, innovative, inclusive and digital. For this purpose, the Programme will encourage much deeper and inter-disciplinary cooperation between higher education institutions, as well as with their surrounding innovation ecosystems, and the strengthening of links between education, research and innovation. The focus will in particular be on strengthening inclusion, mobility, digitalisation, lifelong learning, quality assurance and automatic recognition. The underlying objective is to accelerate the higher education transformation throughout Europe, in order to train the future generations in co-creating knowledge for a resilient, inclusive and sustainable society.
Promoting inter-connected higher education systems: The Programme will aim to strengthen the strategic and structured cooperation between higher education institutions through: a) support for developing and testing various types of cooperation models, including virtual and blended cooperation and the use of different digital tools and online platforms; b) improving mobility by implementing automatic mutual recognition of qualifications and learning outcomes, and by embedding mobility in curricula; c) support for higher education institutions to implement the Bologna principles and tools to enhance mobility for all.
Stimulating innovative learning and teaching practices: to tackle societal challenges through support for: a) the development of learning outcomes and student-centred curricula that better meet the learning needs of students and reduce skills mismatches, while also being relevant for the labour market and for the wider society; b) the development, testing and implementation of flexible learning pathways and modular course design (part-time, online or blended) and appropriate forms of assessment, including the development of online assessment; c) promoting the lifelong learning dimension of higher education, including by facilitating the take-up, validation and recognition of short learning courses leading to micro-credentials; d) implementation of trans-disciplinary approaches and innovative pedagogies such as inverted learning, collaborative online international learning and research-based learning; e) mainstreaming sustainable development in all curricula for students in all disciplines and at all levels.
Developing STEM/STEAM in higher education, in particular women participation in STEM: This priority supports the development and implementation of fit-for-purpose STEM higher education curricula, following a STEAM approach; promoting participation of women in STEM fields of study and especially in engineering, ICT and advanced digital skills; development of guidance and mentoring programmes for students, especially girls and women, to pursue STEM and ICT fields of study and occupations; fostering gender sensitive education and training practices in STEM education; eliminating gender stereotypes in STEM;
Rewarding excellence in learning, teaching and skills development: through a) developing and implementing strategies and quality culture to reward and incentivise excellence in teaching, including online teaching, and teaching for disadvantaged learners; b) training of academics in innovative and/or online pedagogies, including trans-disciplinary approaches, new curriculum design, delivery and assessment methods linking education with research and innovation where relevant, c) fostering an entrepreneurial, open and innovative higher education sector, by promoting learning and teaching partnerships with commercial and non-commercial organisations in the private sector; e) developing of new practices in instructional design, based on educational research and creativity.
Building inclusive higher education systems: The Programme will foster inclusive approaches for the mobility and cooperation activities such as a) increased access, participation and completion rates of target groups with fewer opportunities; b) active support to incoming mobile participants throughout the process of finding accommodation, including through collaboration with the relevant stakeholders for the provision of appropriate and affordable housing; c) supporting the development of flexible career pathways between education and research; d) foster gender balance in higher education institutions, across fields of study and in leadership positions; e) fostering civic engagement through the promotion of informal learning and extra-curricular activities and recognition of voluntary and community work in students’ academic results.
Supporting digital capabilities of the higher education sector: through a) actions that enable the implementation of the European Student Card initiative through secure electronic transfer of students' data between higher education institutions, in full respect of personal data protection and linking where possible with the new Europass; b) development of digital skills and competences of students and staff.
In the field of school education, priority will be given to:
Tackling learning disadvantage, early school leaving and low proficiency in basic skills: The aim of this priority is to help make success possible for all learners, particularly those with fewer opportunities. The priority includes monitoring, early identification of pupils at risks, preventive and early intervention approaches for learners with difficulties, promotion of more learner-centered approaches, promotion of well-being and mental health for learners and teachers, as well as protection from bullying at school. At the level of schools, this priority supports holistic approaches to teaching and learning and collaboration among all actors within schools, as well as with families and other external stakeholders. Finally, at strategic level, the focus is on improving transitions between different stages of education, improving evaluation and developing strong quality assurance systems.
Supporting teachers, school leaders and other teaching professions: This priority supports practitioners in teacher professions (including teacher educators) through all phases of their career. Projects under this priority can focus on enhancing teachers’ initial education, as well as their continuous professional development, in particular by improving the policy framework and concrete opportunities for teacher mobility. A second focus of the priority is making teaching careers more attractive and diverse, and strengthening selection, recruitment and evaluation for teaching professions. Finally, projects can also directly support the development of stronger school leadership and innovative teaching and assessment methods.
Development of key competences: Projects under this priority will focus on promoting cross-curricular collaboration, using innovative learning approaches, developing creativity, supporting teachers in delivering competence-based teaching and developing assessment and validation of key competences.
Promoting a comprehensive approach to language teaching and learning: This priority includes projects that work on supporting the integration of the language dimension across the curricula and ensuring that learners reach adequate language competence levels by the end of compulsory education. Mainstreaming the use of new technologies for language learning is also part of the efforts under this priority. Finally, the priority supports projects that can help create language aware schools and that build on the increasing linguistic diversity in schools, for example by encouraging early language learning and awareness and developing bilingual teaching options (especially in border regions and areas where inhabitants use more than one language).
Promoting interest and excellence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and the STEAM approach: This priority supports projects that promote the STEM approach to education through interdisciplinary teaching in cultural, environmental, economic, design and other contexts. The priority includes development and promotion of effective and innovative pedagogies and assessment methods. Developing partnerships between schools, businesses, higher education institutions, research institutions, and wider society is particularly valuable in this context. At strategic level, the priority serves to promote development of national STEM strategies.
Developing high quality early childhood education and care systems: This priority focuses on promoting the implementation of the EU quality framework for early childhood education and care. It includes projects providing support for initial and continuing professional development of staff involved in organising, leading and providing early childhood education and care. In addition, the priority also supports creating, testing and implementing strategies and practices to foster participation of all children in early childhood education and care, including children with fewer opportunities.
Recognition of learning outcomes for participants in cross-border learning mobility: This priority aims to help put in practice the Council Recommendation on automatic mutual recognition. It supports embedding cross-border class exchanges in school programmes, building capacity of schools to organise learning periods abroad for their pupils, and creation of long-term partnerships between schools in different countries. At strategic level, this priority aims for stronger involvement of school authorities at all levels in efforts to ensure recognition, and it supports development and sharing of tools and practices for preparation, monitoring and recognition of periods abroad.
In the field of vocational education and training (both initial and continuing), priority will be given to:
Adapting vocational education and training to labour market needs: This includes supporting the development of VET programmes that offer a balanced mix of vocational skills and create work-based learning opportunities well aligned to all economic cycles, evolving jobs and working methods and key competences. This priority also fosters the development of VET curricula, programme offers and qualifications which are regularly updated, building on skills intelligence. Projects will support VET providers in the adaptation of their training offer to changing skills needs, green and digital transitions and economic cycles.
Increasing the flexibility of opportunities in vocational education and training: This priority supports initiatives that develop flexible and learner-centred VET programmes, and that contribute to closing existing gaps in the access to training for working age adults to successfully manage labour market transitions. Projects under this priority also contribute to the development of continuing vocational training programmes designed to be adaptable to labour market, as well as programmes that facilitate the transfer, recognition and accumulation of learning outcomes leading to national qualifications.
Contributing to innovation in vocational education and training: This priority supports projects which core aim is to substantially change the way in which VET is practiced, making it more relevant to the current and future needs of the economy and society. These changes can be organizational (planning, financing, human resource management, monitoring and communication). They can also address teaching and learning processes through the development and implementation of new and more relevant teaching and learning approaches. These changes can relate to the VET providers ecosystem and the way they engage with partners, for example through technology diffusion and applied research, advocacy, networking and internationalization activities. They can also target the development and provision of VET products and services (e.g. skills development, applied research, and consultancy) to external actors such as students, companies and governments.
Increasing attractiveness of VET: Priority will be given to projects that contribute to increasing the attractiveness of VET at different levels. Examples of these can be projects that work towards greater permeability between diverse educational levels, that foster open and participative learning environments, support the professional development of VET teachers and trainers, or facilitate recognition of learning outcomes and the use of Europass and other digital services. This priority also support projects that develop long-term partnerships for establishing or reinforcing international, national, regional and sectoral skills competitions. The impact of these activities can be optimised by working closely together with businesses, VET providers, chambers of commerce and other relevant stakeholders along the different phases of the project cycle.
Improving quality assurance in vocational education and training: This priority focuses on measuring and improving quality of VET by developing national quality assurance systems, for both initial and continuing VET, in all learning environments and all learning formats, delivered by both public and private providers. In particular, this includes setting-up and testing graduate tracking arrangements in line with the Council Recommendation on tracking graduates, and the Recommendation on the European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for Vocational Education and Training (EQAVET)1, as well as exploring EU vocational core profiles, and micro-credentials.
Creation and implementation of internationalisation strategies for VET providers: This priority aims at putting in place support mechanisms and contractual frameworks to promote quality mobility of VET staff and learners. Particularly important aspects include automatic mutual recognition of qualifications and learning outcomes, as well as developing student support services for learner mobility. Such services can include informing, motivating, preparing and facilitating the social integration of the VET learners in the host country, as well as enhancing their intercultural awareness and active citizenship.
In the field of adult education priority will be given to:
Improving the availability of high quality learning opportunities for adults: This priority provides support for creation and development of flexible learning offers adapted to the learning needs of adults, for example by developing digital and blended learning opportunities. Priority is also given to projects working on validation of skills acquired through informal and non-formal learning.
Creating upskilling pathways, improving accessibility and increasing take-up of adult education: This priority aims at promoting new adult education opportunities, particularly for adults with a low level of skills, knowledge and competences. Creation of new upskilling pathways should allow adult learners to enhance their key competences and to progress towards higher qualifications. Complementary work covered under this priority includes developing guidance as a service to ensure that adults have access to relevant learning throughout life, improving skills identification and screening, designing tailored learning offers, and developing effective outreach, guidance and motivation strategies.
Improving the competences of educators and other adult education staff: Priority is given particularly to projects that develop staff competences that lead to overall improvements in provision, targeting and effectiveness of adult education. This includes assessment of prior knowledge and skills of adult learners, better and more innovative teaching methods, as well as strengthening the supporting role the adult education staff has in motivating, guiding and advising learners in challenging learning situations.
Enhancing quality assurance in adult education: This priority supports the development of better quality assurance mechanisms for adult learning policies and provision. In particular, this includes development and transfer of monitoring methodologies to measure effectiveness of adult education provision and to track the progress of adult learners.
Developing forward-looking learning centres: This priority aims to support local learning environments, to promote social inclusion, civic engagement and democracy, and to attract and offer everyone in the community lifelong and life wide learning opportunities, also by exploiting digital technologies. Projects could for example, encourage local learning centres, libraries, civil society and the wider community (NGOs, local authorities, health, culture, etc.) to work together to motivate and enable adults of all ages to learn the life skills and key competences necessary to be resilient and adaptable in the face of change and uncertainty.
Promoting Erasmus+ among all citizens and generations: Priority is given to projects that create and promote education opportunities and exchanges of experiences to seniors, with a view to building and strengthening European identity.

COOPERATION PARTNERSHIPS
The primary goal of Cooperation Partnerships is to allow organisations to increase the quality and relevance of their activities, to develop and reinforce their networks of partners, to increase their capacity to operate jointly at transnational level, boosting internationalisation of their activities and through exchanging or developing new practices and methods as well as sharing and confronting ideas. They aim to support the development, transfer and/or implementation of innovative practices as well as the implementation of joint initiatives promoting cooperation, peer learning and exchanges of experience at European level. Results should be re-usable, transferable, up-scalable and, if possible, have a strong transdisciplinary dimension. Selected projects will be expected to share the results of their activities at local, regional, national level and transnational level.

Cooperation Partnerships are anchored to the priorities and policy frameworks of each Erasmus+ sector, both at European and national level, while aiming at producing incentives for cross-sectoral and horizontal cooperation in thematic areas.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
Cooperation Partnerships aim at:
Increasing quality in the work, activities and practices of organisations and institutions involved, opening up to new actors, not naturally included within one sector;
Building capacity of organisations to work transnationally and across sectors;
Addressing common needs and priorities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport;
Enabling transformation and change (at individual, organisational or sectoral level), leading to improvements and new approaches, in proportion to the context of each organisation."

SMALL-SCALE PARTNERSHIPS
Small-scale Partnerships are designed to widen access to the programme to small-scale actors and individuals who are hard to reach in the fields of school education, adult education, vocational education and training, youth and sport. With lower grant amounts awarded to organisations, shorter duration and simpler administrative requirements compared to the Cooperation Partnerships, this action aims at reaching out to grassroots organisations, less experienced organisations and newcomers to the Programme, reducing entry barriers to the programme for organisations with smaller organisational capacity. This action will also support flexible formats – mixing activities with transnational and national character although with a European dimension – allowing organisations to have more means to reach out to people with fewer opportunities. Small-scale Partnerships can also contribute to the creation and development of transnational networks and to fostering synergies with, and between, local, regional, national and international policies.

OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
Attract and widen access for newcomers, less experienced organisations and small-scale actors to the programme. These partnerships should act as a first step for organisations into cooperation at European level. 
Support the inclusion of target groups with fewer opportunities 
Support active European citizenship and bring the European dimension to the local level

In addition, the main objectives of Cooperation Partnerships also apply to Small-sсale Partnerships, proportionally to the scope and volume of each project:
Increasing quality in the work and practices of the organisations and institutions involved, opening up to new actors not naturally included within one sector; 
Building capacity of organisations to work transnationally and across sectors; 
Addressing common needs and priorities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport; 

Priorities of the year, objectives pursued and expected results:
The Directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare ([1])requires the Commission to support Member States in the development of European Reference Networks (ERN). ERN are groups of highly specialised providers across the EU, institutionally approved – following a transparent and formal selection procedure – to perform in an exclusive way the goals and task established in the Commission Delegated Decision 2014/286/EU ([2])and the Commission Implementing Decision 2014/287/EU ([3]). ERNs are addressing a group of highly specialised and complex diseases and treatments.
By pooling knowledge and expertise across the EU, ERNs will facilitate access to diagnosis, treatment and provision of affordable, high quality and cost-effective healthcare contributing to the economy of scale and the sustainability and efficiency of the healthcare systems in the EU.
Setting up an ERN implies a complex work in which the clinician and scientific community have to reach an agreement in a common approach and this bottom up solid proposal is the origin of all Networks. Only national authorities of Member States have the capacity to endorse their providers to participate in an ERN. That implies a legal recognition to the capacity to address the group of diseases an ERN will deal with.
An ERN has to fulfil a list of basic requirements which are listed in the Commission Delegated and Implementing Decisions. Expected benefits to patients and healthcare systems are improvements in services delivery, working systems, patient pathways, clinical tools, earlier adoption of scientific evidence, etc.
The objective of this call is to provide financial support to ERNs, once established. Therefore, only approved ERNs are eligible for co-funding.
Description of the activities to be funded under a call for proposals:
The actions to be funded are coordination, management and non-clinical activities of an approved ERN. Co-funding will be provided in the form of mono-beneficiary grants to the ERN Coordinator to run the ERN and implement all actions in order to fulfil the goals as provided for in the legal basis on ERNs: (i) each ERN shall provide highly specialised healthcare for rare or low prevalence complex diseases or conditions; (ii) have a clear governance and coordination structure; (iii) have knowledge and expertise to diagnose, follow up and manage patients with evidence of good outcomes; (iv) follow a multi-disciplinary approach; (v) offer a high level of expertise and have the capacity to produce good practice guidelines and to implement outcome measures and quality control; (vi) make a contribution to research; (vii) organise teaching and training activities; and (viii) collaborate closely with other centres of expertise and networks at national and international level.

VOLUNTEERING TEAMS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS

WHAT ARE VOLUNTEERING TEAMS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS?
Volunteering Teams in high priority areas are large scale, high impact projects supporting voluntary activities carried out by young people from at least two different countries coming together to express solidarity by implementing short-term interventions that address common European challenges in policy areas defined each year at EU level.

WHAT ARE THE OBJECTIVES?
This year’s priority is focused on COVID-19 impact and recovery, particularly through supporting the health and social care systems with activities tackling prevention, promotion and support in the field of health; addressing major health challenges (i.e. life-threatening illnesses like cancer) and promoting health, healthy lifestyle, physical activity and well-being overall.
For the purpose of this call, applications for funding could:
contribute to the improvement of health and well-being of vulnerable people, including persons affected by chronic or life-threatening diseases (e.g. cancer);
contribute to building inclusive societies through protecting vulnerable groups as people with drug-alcohol dependence, elderly and children, migrants, homeless etc. from COVID-19 impact and other diseases
Additionally, to increase the quality and impact of the action, projects would integrate complementary activities to:
foster European cooperation to strengthen the capacity of the solidarity sector to tackle common European challenges, such as health crisis, protection of vulnerable groups through networking and exchanging experiences;
raise awareness about prevention through campaigns, promotion and information dissemination, public discussions in order to improve the general health of European populations.

WHICH ACTIVITIES CAN BE SUPPORTED?
The following activities are supported:
Volunteering Teams
Volunteering Teams are solidarity activities that allow groups of minimum 5 participants to volunteer together for a period between 2 weeks and 2 months. Composition of the team should be international (including participants from at least two different countries) with at least a quarter of team members coming from countries that are different from the country where the activity takes place. In volunteering teams, European Solidarity Corps’ volunteers carry out tasks for a project over a short period of time (usually, but not exclusively, during holidays, breaks between study periods, transition from education to work, etc.).

Examples of the valuable work that can be accomplished by volunteering teams under this Action include: organising information campaigns, providing critical community services to most vulnerable populations e.g. arranging grocery shopping for elderly, organizing recreational activities for children with cancer, intergenerational workshops on use of online tools for socialising and communicating, supporting vaccination campaigns.
In Volunteering Teams, volunteers will carry out the activity in a group. This can be an incentive for youngsters who do not feel ready to embark into challenging experiences on their own; The activity will be shorter in its duration. This can foster the participation of those youngsters who cannot commit for a long period of time because of their studies or jobs, but still want to be of help for the community.
The above makes also Volunteering Teams an inclusive format, particularly suitable for a first experience in volunteering and the participation of young people with fewer opportunities. They can thus serve as an entry-way for long-term activities or even provide an incentive to start an own solidarity project.
Complementary activities
Complementary activities are relevant side activities designed to add value and augment the results of the project as well as to strengthen its impact on the local, regional, and/or European level. These complementary activities aim at raising awareness of the value of volunteering for young people and for communities as well as at strengthening the recognition of the skills and competences gained by the volunteers. These activities could also enhance the capacity of the solidarity sector organisations to tackle common European challenges and their abilities to develop volunteering projects.
Complementary activities could include workshops, conferences, seminars, training courses, job shadowing, coaching, exchange of good practices etc.
Preparatory Visit
Preparatory visits are visits to the venue of the volunteering activities before they start. They should ensure high quality of activities involving young people with fewer opportunities or when the visit is necessary for the implementation of an activity with a strong inclusion dimension. The visit can focus on facilitating and preparing administrative arrangements, building trust and understanding and setting-up a solid partnership between the organisations and the people involved. Participants with fewer opportunities that will take part in the planned activities can be involved in the visit, in order to help with their preparation and involve them in activity design so that their needs are taken into account from the start.
HOW TO SET UP A PROJECT?
A project is implemented by at least three organisations from at least two different eligible countries and will typically consist of the following stages:
Planning (defining the needs, objectives, development of work programme, schedule of activities etc.);
Preparation (practical arrangements, selection of participants, set up of agreements with partners and participants, linguistic/intercultural/task-related preparation of participants before departure);
Implementation of activities (including support and guidance to participants during the activities);
Follow-up (the evaluation of the activities, follow-up of participants, issue of the certificate of participation as well as the dissemination and use of the project's outcomes).
Implementation of cross-border solidarity activities for groups of volunteers are the core of a project. A project must thus include at least one volunteering team activity. A project should also include complementary activities. Furthermore, organisations are encouraged to organise preparatory visits to ensure high quality of activities involving young people with fewer opportunities. Eligibility criteria laid down below must be respected.
Selection of Participants
Young people who want to participate in the European Solidarity Corps must register on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. Young people with fewer opportunities may receive support from organisations to complete the registration phase. The European Solidarity Corps Portal offers a place for those young people and organisations holding a Quality Label and willing to implement solidarity activities to find each other. Organisations have to select the participants from the database of registered young people.
Quality and support measures
A set of measures and services, such as training, language learning support, identification and documentation of the competences acquired, insurance are foreseen to ensure the quality of the volunteering activities and a strong learning dimension for the participants. Some of these measures are optional and could be used depending on the interest and needs of the participants, and some of them are compulsory. Organisations should aim to promote the use of the General Online Training as part of the volunteers’ learning experience. Detailed information on those measures is available in Part D of this Guide.
Inclusion and diversity
The European Solidarity Corps seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness. Organisations should design accessible and inclusive activities, taking into account the views and needs of participants with fewer opportunities.
To support inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities, additional support measures and funding that allow participating organisations to better accommodate and cater for the needs of young people with fewer opportunities are available.
In order to benefit from additional funding applicants will be required to describe how they involve young people who are at comparative disadvantage i.e they have comparatively fewer opportunities than their peers in the same country/area/age group/situation, what are the specific needs to ensure their participation on equal terms as others and what specific measures they plan to put in place to cater for these needs.
In this sense, “involving” does not refer to a target group the organisations work with. It means to facilitate the participation of young people with fewer opportunities by designing the measures of outreach and support as well as the project activities in an inclusive and accessible way.
Environmental protection, sustainable development and climate action
Volunteering activities should promote environmentally sustainable and responsible behaviour among participants, raising the awareness about the importance of acting to reduce or compensate for the environmental footprint of activities. Volunteering activities should be designed and implemented with environmental consciousness by e.g. integrating sustainable practices such as reducing waste and recycling, using sustainable means of transportation.
Digital transition
Participating organisations are encouraged to make use of digital tools and learning methods to complement their physical activities, to improve the cooperation between partner organisations, and the quality of the activities.
WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA USED TO ASSESS PROJECTS?
The projects are selected and managed at EU level, by the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA).

These requirements will impact the underlying cloud infrastructure requiring efficient management of very large sets of globally distributed non-structured or semi-structured data that could be produced at very high rates (i.e. big data). A multi-cloud service platform supported by broadband networks needs to handle all these challenges and appear to the application environment as one uniform platform.
Scope: The focus of the joint research is the development of innovative global cloud platform technologies to meet the new challenges of big data, mobile and IoT. It should address requirements from business and industrial applications, such as robotics or factory automation and/or societal applications, such as health management for an aging society.
The outcome of the research will be a global, scalable and flexible service platform for developing real time services which can process, integrate and visualize Big Data over advanced integrated cloud and network infrastructures.
Future standardization requirements should be considered. The technologies developed should be validated through relevant use cases and demonstrations requiring the combination of real world sensors and/or actuators with “big data” infrastructures over clouds.
Expected impact:
         Credible demonstrations based on cross-border business and/or societal applications of robust interoperable technologies combining big data, IoT and mobile on cloud platforms.
         Concrete implementations of interoperable solutions that integrate big data, IoT and mobile that are candidates for standardisation.
         Potential for commercial application in business environments, expressed in the form of a credible international exploitation plan.

Recently, 5G has been subject of intensive research and development actions in many regions in the world. The republic of Korea has launched an ambitious set of projects (e.g. Giga-Korea project) towards early deployment by 2020. Beyond regional developments, a certain level of technological convergence at an early stage during the research phases is considered beneficial to ensure future consensus on global standards, timeline or spectrum usage. Similarly, global convergences at use case and applicability levels of future 5G networks are considered useful.
A key challenge will be to avoid and overcome the fragmentation of multiple initiatives to address technologies with similar characteristics, use case potential thus fostering global interoperability and wide spread adoption.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
It covers technology demonstration that addresses and demonstrates feasibility of an integrated architectural approach towards heterogeneous accesses (with emphasis on mmWave access including RF/Antenna, Relay, Base stations and Terminals), high capacity/resilient backhaul, an evolved packet core implemented through NFV/SDN based core functions, high precision/integrity positioning techniques for advanced location based services/timing and satellite communication and navigation technologies where appropriate.
The setup of the demonstration should allow to show the principle support of specific requirements of vertical sectors, though not at the stage of a large scale implementation. Most challenging 5G characteristics should be targeted for the technology demonstration, for instance latency in the ms range, capability to serve very dense user environments without loss of performance (such as throughput or energy consumption), capability to provide various network functions (e.g., mobile core, heterogeneous fixed and mobile access convergence, satellite, virtualization, orchestration), capability to support high precision/integrity ubiquitous location based services and timing, capability to support various types of IoT, and interoperability between them. Furthermore, the capability should be demonstrated to efficiently provide ubiquitous 5G services.
The main output of the work is a proof of concept for an interoperability/architecture framework which demonstrates a possible way forward for the needed definition of the interoperability specifications, that future 5G products have to achieve, and towards related standardisation activities for existing and new interfaces.
Prototype installations and proof of concept are expected to be implemented and demonstrated in the context of the 2018 Olympic Games of Pyungchang.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contribution to the definition of a 5G interoperability architectural framework
Contribution to the identification of key interfaces to standardise
Contribution to the integration framework towards access and core
Support to related standardisation activities (e.g. 3G PP)

The next phase of 5G covers, both in EU and in South Korea, technologies and systems demonstrations and trials. The challenge is hence to demonstrate innovative use of 5G technologies and system interoperability for a number of 5G applications of interest in the two regions in early version of the 5G standard. The possibilities of even broader regional test beds or demonstrators can be proposed, e.g. through extension to other countries or regions as this could further strengthen the co-operation towards a global 5G.
The overall goal is to evaluate in real setup innovative end-to-end 5G systems built on the outcomes of the previous phase of the 5G R&I in the earlier joint call with South Korea and focus on demonstrations of applications and use cases in joint pilots in line with the phase 3 targets of 5G-PPP and their validation in a system context and in the context of multiple use cases, with performances well beyond those of early 5G trials planned over the 2018-20 period.
The call will further advance common interests in standards (e.g. cell free networks and related RAN architecture) as well as advances concerning the core network, such as slicing and virtualisation which require more efforts in cloud like core environments and open source approaches.
Scope:
The focus should be on large-scale demonstrations and trials towards 5G applications, this to have a strong focus on the harmonization for 5G standards and spectrum.
The proposals should address one of the two areas (a or b):
a) Focus on mmwave and super broadband services: The 5G vision on super broadband services mainly related to very high definition immersive video services (virtual reality) using mmWave frequency bands. This should be in the proposed specific context of the ground/aerial vehicles and also possibly include a focus towards autonomous network technologies toward safe and automated 5G networks.
This focus should include demonstration of 5G technologies concerning,
(1) Access networks, notably: i) Various duplexing technologies with (or without) interference cancellation; ii) Efficient radio transmission technology for the mmwave relay links; iii) Advanced beamforming (fast switching & adaptive hybrid.
(2) Core networks, notably: i) Implementation and Proof of Concepts of 5G core systems prototype software (e.g. AMF, SMF, UPF); ii) Implementation of end-to-end network slicing and orchestration and management of autonomous 5G networks; iii) Implementation of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC).
b) Focus on interoperability and integration of 5G vertical testbeds on heterogeneous environments: An open approach is to be taken to achieve a closer co-operation in spectrum harmonisation and co-operation in interoperability testing, e.g. in the C-band and/or Ka-band, to achieve coexistence and inter-working between same/different radio access technologies considering both terrestrial (i.e., cellular) and non- terrestrial links (i.e., satellite) incorporating QoS transparency between difference 5G mobile core networks.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow each area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Global interoperability demonstrations for 5G networks, contribution to the integration framework towards access and core.
- Joint contributions to global 5G standards specifications in relevant organisations (e.g. 3GPP, ITU-R), especially in view of 5G phase 2 standardisation (beyond eMBB) and IMT2020 spectrum harmonization.
- Succesful showcasing trials or testbeds with, ideally, joint demonstration across regions.

This topic covers two interrelated and complementary areas:
a. National HPC Competence Centres – The aim is to support existing or the creation in a maximum number of countries of up to one national HPC Competence Centre in each of the EU Member States and EuroHPC JU Participating States. The national HPC Competence Centres should provide HPC services to industry (including to SMEs), academia and public administrations, delivering tailored /modular solutions for a wide variety of users, with an aim to ease and foster the transition towards wider uptake of HPC in Europe. It should be the focal point coordinating all national initiatives, facilitating access of national stakeholders to European HPC competence and opportunities in different industrial sectors and domains.
b. Networking and coordination of national HPC Competence Centres with the aim to maximize existing European HPC knowledge and expertise across Europe. The tasks and services of the network will be to establish a single focal point at European level, that will be responsible for the coordination of the national Competence Centres, the exchange of best practices, know-how and information, networking and training across national HPC Competence Centres.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions
Set-up and operate one HPC Competence Centre in a maximum number of countries of each of the EU Member States and EuroHPC JU Participating States, associated to the national supercomputing centres. The HPC Competence Centre should provide leading-edge, innovative solutions taking into account national HPC needs and requirements emanating from different users (industry, academia, public administrations), and develop the necessary expertise and applications know-how close to the users. National HPC Competence Centres should implement a flexible and modular approach in the services to be provided, taking into account the degree of maturity of the national HPC infrastructure.
HPC Competence Centres should provide for example services such as:
Facilitate uptake of HPC applications by different users, including SMEs (e.g. promoting locally relevant success stories), academia and public administrations.
Facilitate access to scientific/technical expertise/consulting through application oriented HPC know-how/focus (e.g. HPC and High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA)), as well as access to advanced simulation and modelling algorithms, software codes and tools.
Onsite evaluations of new technologies, experimenting, proof of concept, facilitating access to the HPC ecosystem including testbeds, hands-on sessions on HPC and, HPC application optimising and scaling in a number of fields.
Facilitate access to supercomputing and data management for exploring innovation solutions of interest to end users, including SME user industries.
Local and national training and skills development in the area of HPC and related subjects (e.g. HPDA, parallel programming, etc.), through face-to-face as well as online training (e.g. MOOC platforms).
Awareness raising and outreach on the benefits of HPC to potential user industries, including SMEs.
Implementing technology transfer activities at local/national level and the Digital Single Market.
It is required that the national HPC Competence Centre – consisting of either one or several national organisations - is formally designated and mandated by the national authorities of the EU Member State or the EuroHPC JU Participating State.
The JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the JU of up to EUR 1 million per national HPC Competence Centres[1], matched by the Participating States with a similar amount, and a duration of 2 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another duration or requesting other amounts. Only one proposal including a maximum number of national HPC Competence Centres will be selected.
b. Coordination and Support Action
Proposals should aim at coordinating the national HPC Competence Centres. In particular, it is expected to establish a communication platform, facilitate dialogue, promote the objectives of the HPC Competence Centres and organize outreach events and workshops (on topics identified by the national HPC Competence Centres). It is expected to identify potential training solutions and tools available from the HPC Competence Centres network to support and assist national HPC Competence Centres requests and/or needs and help networking of respective national and European activities including through the provision of mentoring and twinning schemes.
Proposals should address all the following points:
coordinate and be a reference point for national HPC initiatives ensuring the exchange of best practice and information across Europe;
ensure that the specific “vertical” expertise and solutions of each national Competence Centre provide coordinated support on a local level to other Competence Centres, facilitating cross-domain expertise and share effective solutions for industry, academia and the public sector;
coordinate centrally mentoring and twinning programmes with the aim to accelerate the development of ‘new’ HPC Competence Centres and build strong collaborations across HPC Competence Centres with similar interests;
sharing of existing libraries of HPC codes and, inter alia facilitate access to upgraded HPC application codes in order to encourage mutual learning and strive towards reaching a uniform maturity level across HPC Competence Centres and help close the gap between experienced and less experienced countries.
It is expected that such an activity be driven by the relevant actor(s) bringing in the required expertise and a solid and robust track-record in offering HPC Competence Centre related services to a variety of users including industry, as well as HPC-related training activities at European level.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To demonstrate in pre-operational environments the successful integration of European technology building blocks developed for example in the European Processor Initiative (EPI) and in previously funded EU R&I actions into fully integrated pilot supercomputing systems commensurate with exascale performance objectives along with other European IP such as software tools and application libraries, interconnects, rack design, cooling systems, advanced fabric management, etc... The goal of these pilot supercomputing systems will be to produce a prototype system which can be used in a pre-operational environment, able to execute jobs and run software components designed as part of the pilot programme.
Two such pilot supercomputing systems will be supported whose work will be closely inter-coordinated. They will have to demonstrate how the challenges of power efficiency, usability, resiliency and scalability can be met, by considering in particular a strong co-design approach driven by ambitious application requirements. The involved stakeholders should include technology component suppliers, system integrators, supercomputing infrastructure providers and user communities.
ders and user communities.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to address the European research, technology building blocks integration, system co-design, validation and experimentation of advanced supercomputing pilot systems aiming at exascale performance, driven by a set of ambitious extreme data and HPC application and power-efficiency requirements.
The approaches should ensure that they contribute to the realisation of future exascale system architectures based on European low-power processing technologies, such as those developed for example in the EPI initiative. Each proposal should aim at realising one supercomputing pilot system. Pilot systems should maximise the integration of European hardware and software technologies, and foster, to the extent possible, the development of solutions based on European open hardware and open-source software.
Two complementary pilot supercomputing systems are expected to be supported, based on the European Processor Initiative (EPI) and/or other previously funded EU R&I actions:
One leveraging the efforts on European low power general purpose processing technologies
A complementary one leveraging the efforts on European open hardware solutions (e.g. an agnostic HPC system able to embed, cool and manage existing components and future ones, such as accelerator technologies based on RISC-V or other components that can simulate the behaviour of future European components)
The proposals should address all the following points:
Description of the supercomputing pilot system, with architectural features and measurable objectives that demonstrate the relevance and potential of the pilot system as a meaningful step towards the realisation of future operational European exascale systems. The description of the pilot should address amongst other: targeted number of computing elements, interconnects and network topologies for exascale, cooling, I/O, etc.
Definition of clear and measurable intermediate and final targets to demonstrate the suitability of the pilot system, for example in terms of system performance, performance improvements for the selected applications, power budget and efficiency, scalability, resilience, etc. The proposal should clearly describe the approach to measure and verify each of these targets and should demonstrate that the pilot system would offer a clear approach towards overall reduced power consumption.
Description of software issues, including software stack, software scaling and adaptation for heterogeneous systems, software reliability, optimisation, and inclusion of a set of software programming tools and environments, compiler technologies for basic instruction sets and for higher level support of applications at scale with various programming models, etc. Pilot systems should aim to offer a pluralism in European solutions and maximise their integration inside the software stack.
The integration of different European cooling systems, including prototype systems for their further testing and development.
Clear identification of the European technology hardware and building blocks and how they are integrated and leveraged in the pilot systems. In particular, proposals have to demonstrate how the pilot system aligns with the efforts of European low power processing technologies, by describing the mechanisms that will be used for that purpose.
Identification of a set of ambitious and relevant applications for the system co-design, describing how and when application developers and users will be involved in the co-design process, and what measures will be taken to attract and motivate users and developers to adopt the technologies proposed in the pilot system, in view of maximising their use and acceptance.
Clear timed description of the engineering approach for the pilot systems, indicating for example the timing to development and release of the proposed hardware and software solutions, evaluation, testing, and the validation and deployment of the pilot systems in close-to-operation environments. The approach should also describe the involvement of users and developers (with the eventual re-writing, porting, re-factoring etc. of codes) in a co-design approach.
Description of the use of the pilot systems in the operational environment during the life of the project and once the project is completed, including targeted services, communities and applications, etc…
Description of mechanisms for cooperation between the pilot systems that would be supported by the action: the successful proposals are expected to establish a close collaboration in order to ensure to the extent possible the convergence and compatibility of the different results and solutions developed in the pilot systems, e.g. hardware/software stacks, components, common or fully interoperable software environments, common or fully interoperable application development platforms, common architectural views, etc. These mechanisms will be formalised in a cooperation framework gathering the selected pilot systems.
Wherever appropriate, actions should seek synergies and co-financing from relevant national or regional research and innovation programmes.
The EuroHPC JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the JU of up to EUR 22 million for the first pilot above and up to 15 million for the second pilot above, matched by the Participating States with a similar amount, and a duration of between 3 and 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another duration or requesting other amounts.
Considering the specific objectives of the calls for proposals and the fact that these calls concern areas of critical importance for the security of the Union and the Digital Single Market and may pose potential risk to ensuring European technological autonomy in line with Article 9(5) of the Rules for Participation[1], the EuroHPC JU may limit the participation of legal entities established in associated countries and legal entities established in the EU but controlled from third countries.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should describe how the proposed work will contribute to the impacts listed below and include a baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact:
Contribution to the realisation of the EuroHPC JU’s overall and specific objectives[2]
Strengthening scientific leadership as well as the competitiveness and innovation potential of the European industry through the further development and use of European technologies
Contributing to a sustainable exascale HPC supply ecosystem in Europe and ensuring European technological autonomy in this field
Leveraging the efforts on the European low power processing (in particular the European Processor Initiative) or in open hardware technologies and contributing to the realisation of future exascale system architectures based on such technologies

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Within the Framework Partnership Agreement[1] in European low-power microprocessor technologies awarded in 2017, the selected consortium will be invited to submit a Research and Innovation Action proposal for the second phase of the design and development of European low-power processors and related technologies for extreme-scale, high-performance big-data, AI and emerging applications, in accordance with the research roadmap defined in the respective FPA.
Scope:
In particular, the proposal will build on the results of the Phase 1 of the European Processor Initiative (EPI), and is expected to cover the following topics:
Development of the second generation of low-power general purpose processing system units. Generate the functional and non-functional requirements (using representative HPC and big-data benchmarks, emerging applications specifications (in the automotive sector for example), and targeting maximum energy-efficiency and reliability; design the architecture of the processing system units; verify, tape-out, validate, test and bring up the processing system units; develop the required firmware and system software leveraging, as much as possible, on open source efforts and solutions.
Development of the second generation of low-power processing system units for application acceleration. Generate their functional and non-functional requirements (using relevant representative HPC and big data benchmarks and emerging applications) and design their architecture to accelerate specific HPC and big data applications, including as edge and embedded automotive applications or other emerging applications. The applications must have high-volume potential. Processing units will be realised as standalone components, distributed collaborating systems or IP-blocks, and will include stand-alone open RISC V hardware approaches for accelerators with connectivity not limited to the EPI processing units, addressing a large number of application areas. Work in this topic is required to interface with topic a) in order to achieve maximum interoperability (including IP-block interfacing) and roadmap synchronisation.
Validation of the first generation of low-power processing system units developed in Phase 1 (and Phase 2). Finalize the required firmware and system software leveraging, as much as possible, on open source efforts and solutions; development and integration of the boards/blades and test benches to demonstrate the processing units and accelerators developed in Phase 1 (and Phase 2) of EPI with the porting of representative sets of real-life kernels for the chosen application(s). This will address also the integration and interconnection of the EPI hardware ecosystem with other approaches.
Support for a hardware and software development platform common to different processor and accelerator types. This platform should be accessible by a wide range of interested parties. Support should also be directed towards maximising early on the uptake by users of processor and accelerator technology developed in Phases 1 and 2 of EPI for testing purposes.
The developed technologies will demonstrate the synergies between HPC at the exascale level and scalability to distributed collaborating systems in emerging computing applications, in the automotive sector for example. The designs should follow a modular approach that would allow a rapid scale-up or scale-down. Sustainability and economic viability of the developed solutions are key aspects.
Wherever appropriate in order to address specific technology needs and/or activities, the consortium should seek additional partners to join the FPA consortium, provided they respect the objectives of the project.
The EuroHPC JU considers that a proposal requesting a contribution from the JU of up to EUR 35 million, matched by the Participating States with a similar amount, and a duration of up to 3 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal with another duration or requesting other amounts.
Wherever appropriate, the proposal could seek synergies and co-financing from relevant national or regional research and innovation programmes, including structural funds addressing smart specialisation. Work combining different sources of financing should include a concrete financial plan detailing the use of these funding sources for the different parts of the activities.
Considering the specific objectives of the call for proposals and the fact that these calls concern areas of critical importance for the security of Union and the Digital Single Market and may pose potential risk to ensuring European technological autonomy in line with Article 9(5) of the Rules for Participation, the EuroHPC JU may limit the participation of legal entities established in associated countries and legal entities established in the EU but controlled from third countries.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Central objective of this call is to develop and implement the pilot(s) of the European Master of Science (MSc) programme(s) for High Performance Computing (HPC). The graduate education programme(s) will focus HPC and HPC-usage. They will demonstrate the added value of a pan-European education programme, committed to academic excellence, that offers students an outstanding career perspective in international companies and research institutes.
HPC is a rapidly accelerating field of research and development with a strong potential for economic growth. HPC, data science, data analytics and the data-economy are becoming increasingly important for many industry and commercial sectors. While basic computer science and programming languages are included in many university curricula, existing education programmes do not meet the demands on modern education adapted to a rapidly developing HPC technology ecosystem. Increased HPC awareness and an HPC-proficient workforce are essential to develop a competitive HPC ecosystem in Europe in the next years. The availability of HPC experts to drive the European digital transformation, such as HPC administrators and architects, HPC proficient data scientists, HPC application developers and expert users, depends on the education of highly skilled and talented graduate students.
The call aims at creating one or more pan-European pilots for the development of a modern HPC-centred education programme to reach scientific and industrial target groups and to serve key actors in the private and public sector.
Scope:
European Master (MSc) programme in HPC
Proposals under this action should detail a pilot programme that aims to develop a quality-controlled educational master programme for HPC and industrial applications in HPC of pan-European reach.
The action should support the design and delivery of a master programme of pan-European reach for 50+ students per annual intake, equivalent to 120 ECTS and targeting advanced skills development to widen the scientific and industrial use of HPC applications. Two cohorts of students should complete the pilot programme.
The proposed projects must fulfil the following objectives:
Educate students able to contribute in areas such as the design, deployment, operation, and/or the use of current and future generation HPC and HPC-related technologies in Europe.
Educate experts skilled in driving HPC adoption and knowledge transfer in industry and academia in different strategic domains, thereby linking HPC activities in industry and academia.
The proposed master programmes should address all of the following aspects:
Design the framework and pilot of a two-year European joint master programme and its learning outcomes, and detail how excellence in academic content, teaching and talent development will be achieved and sustained among all partners in the consortium.
Propose a general curriculum for a master programme on the design of HPC platforms, HPC adoption in industry, expertise in HPC environments and applications using HPC.
Ensure a modular design of the curriculum, with clear identification of scientific disciplines, industrial applications and HPC usage profiles (designer, developer, administrator, user), that facilitates full or partial adoption of the modules into new or existing MSc programmes.
Explain how students will be immersed in research activities and educated in European technology and applications throughout the curriculum and according to their specific interests.
Provide information on the envisaged learning environment and opportunities for personal development and the development of a collaborative and inclusive student community.
Describe the details of the awarded MSc degree, which academic institutions at pan-European level will award it and in what form (e.g. joint or multiple degrees).
Define a transparent, effective and competitive selection process for the admission of students, addressing the requirements of European stakeholders.
Explain how a balanced intake of students regarding geographical origin and underrepresented groups will be achieved.
Explain which measures will be implemented to ensure that only students who are nationals of EU or Participating States may receive financial benefits by the programme.
Educate students and provide room for creativity in using leading and emerging European HPC systems and technology as part of the MSc programme.
Clearly elaborate the benefits of a pan-European MSc programme for students and stakeholders. Ensure excellence to attract talents and partners from the public and private sector.
Develop and implement an action plan using existing links to industry, entrepreneurship centres, business incubators, academic partners and other European initiatives to support students after graduation in their careers in HPC.
Promote the programme across Europe and specifically in countries where HPC adoption is low to increase diversity, participation by underrepresented groups and to support a broad geographical coverage of applicants.
Develop substantial content, teaching materials and online courses to complement on-site courses, which should also be provided to a broader community under an open license using a coherent structure and format to support the adoption by other education programmes.
Explain the mechanisms to share expertise and resources among the consortium.
Address the requirements and needs of relevant European industry players (supply and user industry). Expectations and commitment of industry partners, e. g. in mentorship programmes, should be described in detail and the added value clearly identified.
Demonstrate how the requirements of SMEs will be taken into account in the education programme.
The proposed action should deliver a set of lessons learned for the implementation of a pan-European education programme in HPC inspired by the present pilot programme. Moreover, concrete recommendations including a roadmap to achieve a sustainable and successful MSc programme on the basis of the pilot should be provided by the end of the project.
The action should also facilitate mobility and internships for students as a part of HPC master programme.
Student mobility between European universities, research centres and industry should be designed as a part of the study programme in synergy and coordination with other mobility programmes (Summer of HPC, HPC Europe, Erasmus+ etc.) to support awareness and collaboration across communities. Proposals should also explain how mobility will be achieved.
For students pursuing an industry-focussed track of the MSc programme, student internships at industry or at research institutions will be a mandatory part of the study programme curricula. Expected duration of the internships is from 3 to 6 months during the second year of the study. The consortium should implement appropriate measures to ensure a high quality and comprehensive supervision of the students during the internship (clear work plan, personal supervisor, monitoring and on-site visits by coordinator, feedback loop etc.). Costs incurred by entities hosting students during internships are not eligible.
Requirements on consortium: The consortium should demonstrate a good mix of excellence in education, research and in HPC technologies and applications, with solid links to the HPC supply and user industry in Europe. Moreover, the participating institutions should demonstrate complementary and well-justified roles in the programme with an outstanding track record in their respective field. The consortium should support inclusivity in Europe and help in creating a level-playing field across Europe, and in particular for those countries currently developing their HPC infrastructure and ecosystem.
As consortium partners following types of institutions are eligible:
Higher education institutions (HEI) that are able to deliver a curriculum equivalent to 120 ECTS credits and award a master degree diploma (coordinator and main partners)
Supercomputing centers
Research institutions focused on HPC
Other entities eligible for participation in H2020, including private and for-profit companies, are eligible to participate in the action in exceptional and well-justified cases.
Each HEI in the consortium should provide a letter of commitment from their respective legal representative.
The consortium as a whole should provide a clear plan how the availability of state-of-the-art computing resources and emerging technology will be ensured for the activities within the project.
An advisory board consisting of industry and academic representatives must be constituted for the project. Letters of commitment from potential members of the advisory board should be provided as a part of the project proposal.
The EuroHPC JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the JU for a duration of up to 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another duration.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should describe how the proposed work will contribute to the impacts listed below:
Contribution to the realisation of the EuroHPC JU’s overall and specific objectives
Establishment of a high quality, internationally competitive MSc programme in HPC across the Union with measurable key performance indicators and addressing requirements and needs of the European industry
Improved coordination and increased availability of educational activities on HPC

Deadline date","Scope:
State-of-the-art scientiﬁc computing, especially for large-scale applications, lies in the massively parallel heterogeneous architectures of HPC systems. Accelerators can maximize the parallelism of HPC systems for scientiﬁc computing. However, solving large scientific problems requires huge amounts of computing capacities and memory that current HPC systems cannot optimally address. One solution for performing computations with such a large amount of memory and processors would be the quantum simulator.
A quantum simulator is a highly controllable quantum device that allows one to obtain insights into properties of complex quantum systems or solve specific computational problems inaccessible to classical computers. It can efficiently complement the parallel architecture of current supercomputers and act as “accelerator”, addressing applications related to complex simulation and optimisation problems, notably for materials development, drug discovery, transportation and other real-world problems of high importance to industry.
The objective of the pilot action will be to develop, deploy and coordinate at European level a European quantum simulation (QS) infrastructure of circa 100+ interacting quantum units that shall be accessible via the cloud on a non-commercial basis to public and private European users. European quantum simulation technologies are currently being developed by EU projects or by national projects [1]in the Member States. The action will cover the acquisition of one such quantum simulator and its maintenance costs, the development of the interconnection between the classical supercomputer and the quantum simulator and the development of the necessary cloud access and middleware for programming and running applications in the quantum simulator. The European quantum simulator should be hosted by a supercomputing center located in the Union and co-located with a EuroHPC or Tier-0 supercomputer that should be existing at the moment when the project would start or soon after.
The objective of opening up such early computing platforms (whether in the form of quantum simulators or first physical computing platforms) widely to European users is to help them familiarize with quantum technologies, test their capabilities/performances and develop their first quantum applications and algorithms. The aim is not only to train users in using quantum computing systems but, most importantly, to develop an early ecosystem of quantum programming facilities and application libraries.
The EuroHPC JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the JU of up to EUR 6 million, matched by the Participating States with a similar amount, and a duration of between 3 to 5 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. The costs include the acquisition of one quantum simulator and its maintenance and operation cost.

","Research and Innovation action
","19 January 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The hydrogen refuelling stations currently being deployed worldwide are mainly based on common mechanical compressor technology. Mechanical compressors are proven technology, but lack the desired durability, efficiency and reliability. This results in high operational and maintenance cost.
Roughly half of the investment cost of common hydrogen refuelling stations consists of mechanical hydrogen compressors cascaded in series to meet the above 700 bar dispensing pressure for fuel cell cars.
Currently available hydrogen compressors are too costly and noisy for decentralized production and efficient storage of hydrogen. The noise level should not be higher than 60 dB at a distance of 5 meters. Additionally the lifetime of the utilized compressors should be at least 20 years. The unit should be able to perform well under frequent start and stop cycles and maintain robust seals.
The technology proposed for development is preferably applicable in both the current and future Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS), reinforcing the HRS exploitation business case. It should maintain high efficiency over a wide range of compression- 1 bar to 1000 bars, in order to be able to take in hydrogen not only from high pressure electrolysis, but also from low pressure hydrogen sources like biomass conversion and steam-methane-reforming/Pd-membrane systems. The energy demand to pressurize the hydrogen from 1 to 1000 bars should be 6 kWh/ kg H2 or less. Most important is that the compression system is sufficiently dynamic to follow the (variable) hydrogen production rate when coupled directly to renewable hydrogen sources.
Scope:
This topic calls for proposals to develop innovative hydrogen compression technology that is modularly scalable, intrinsically silent and low cost, with competitive compression energy demand and attractive investment cost. The proposed technology is benchmarked against the mechanical compressor technology commercially available today and should have higher reliability, with the potential of lower maintenance cost and less down time of compressor systems.
It is expected that the technology readiness level at the end of the project is at least 5, meaning that the compression technology has been tested in a relevant environment, for instance in a small scale refuelling station (10-100 kg H2/ day), or in a hydrogen storage facility in an island situation.
Proposals should further plan to assess the economic feasibility of the proposed innovative hydrogen compression technology.
The project should include:
Development of a modularly scalable, low noise hydrogen compression technology capable of compressing hydrogen at an energy demand of < 6 kWh / kg H2 from 1 to 1000 bars (or equivalent) and aiming to achieve an installed system cost of < €2,000/ (kg H2/day) on the long term.
Long duration testing of a typical start-stop operational profile during 9 months with <10% performance decay.
Validation of the hydrogen compression technology in a relevant simulated environment.
Cost of ownership assessment of the developed hydrogen compression technology
Recommendations supporting the technology development process, leading to large-scale manufacturing capability of lower cost, modular, compression systems.
TRL start: 3
TRL end: 5
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic
Expected Impact:
The project will show realization of a cost effective hydrogen compression system that can be applied at variable scale, in distributed and island situations, for hydrogen refuelling and for dynamic storage needs, with the possibility to drop-in/replace the current compression sub-systems in HRS.
Concrete topic targets and related impact:
Modular scalability and operation: modular scalability of compression capacity allows for flexible and lean small scale system construction and for continued operation during maintenance, eliminating down time.
Low noise level: the noise level plays an important role especially at metropolitan areas. To satisfy the customer the noise level should not be higher than 60 dB at a distance of 5 meters.
Low energy demand
Hydrogen compression technology should be able to achieve 6 kWh/kg H2 for 1 to 1000 bar compression
Low cost:
CAPEX: The installed system cost target of hydrogen compression is
< €4,000/ (kg H2/day) on a short term basis with a target of <€2,000/(kgH2/day) on a longer term.
OPEX: the installed system is expected to have significantly lower maintenance cost and lower down time compared to conventional technology"

Hydrogen compression remains a major bottleneck in the development of the refuelling infrastructure for H2 mobility. The need for reliable and low-cost compression solutions are considered therefore strategically important as the economy prepares for large scale deployment of hydrogen technologies, including heavy-duty applications. Currently used piston or membrane compressors are noisy, require high maintenance, have substantial downtime and have a large footprint.
In the frame of already supported FCH 2 JU projects [46] (PHAEDRUS, Don Quichote, H2Ref, COSMHYC XL), innovative compression solutions have been identified and technologies were advanced to TRL 5. These include electrochemical and metal hydride compressors, as well as a combination of conventional and innovative compression technologies into integrated solutions. There is a need now to test these concepts on reliability in a full-size scale HRS. Scale up to economically viable level as measured in total cost of ownership, hydrogen quality in compliance with fuel cell grade hydrogen purity and convincing demonstration of these technologies are the challenges to meet in order for them to become ready for market entry.
Alternative hydrogen compressor technologies could remove the typical disadvantages of current mechanical compressors like high maintenance/down time, therefore high operational cost and high noise levels. Innovative H2 compressor technology development could reduce the HRS cost and footprint while increasing its reliability.
[46] https://www.fch.europa.eu/page/fch-ju-projects
Scope:
This topic calls for a scale up through standardization of design, allowing easy maintenance, demonstration and proof of sufficient availability and lifetime of an innovative, low noise compressor system applied in a hydrogen refuelling station with a renewable hydrogen source that can be built close to residential areas, ready for market entry towards the end of the project.
The project should develop an end-user specification of the innovative compressor system designed for HRS followed by construction, commissioning, qualification and certification - therefore resulting in a demonstration of a more than 200 kg H2/day standardized, containerized hydrogen compressor system in a hydrogen refuelling station;. This could be based on one single innovative hydrogen compression technology or on a combination of innovative compression technology with a conventional compression technology, for the purpose of reliability and reduced investment and operating cost.
It is expected at least 1 year of testing under real operating conditions, serving a fleet of passenger vehicles, refuelling at 700bar at a designed compressor system scale of minimum 200 kg H2/day.
The project should explicitly identify and motivate the selected site in EU where the H2 compressor technology will be applied for refueling.
The project may have limited focus (and related limited funding) on activities regarding the construction of a new HRS or the adaptation of an existing HRS.
Techno-economic analysis throughout and at the end of the project should assess market readiness and show the feasibility of future scale up of the new developed compressor technology to a level of 2,000 kg H2/day, including ambitious KPI targets for CAPEX, maintenance and efficiency. Lifetime assessment through accelerated stress testing and theoretical model extrapolation is expected to allow for lifetime indication of the compressor technology.
The project should include an assessment of the output hydrogen purity, proving that the innovative compressor technology does not introduce impurities harmful to any fuel cell, maintaining 99.999% hydrogen purity, or perform a risk assessment on hydrogen purity, aiming for SAE J2719/ISO 14687-2/3 (5N) standard for fuel cell grade hydrogen.
TRL at start of the project: 5 and TRL at the end of the project: 7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
“CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform [47] to ensure that the hydrogen produced and dispensed at the HRS is of renewable nature.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 3 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.

Expected Impact:
Innovative H2 compressor technology development should demonstrate how will reduce the HRS cost and footprint while increasing its reliability for a cost-effective compression towards the 2024 targets.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The urban bus application has been identified as a priority value application for fuel cells and hydrogen, for a number of reasons: a political agenda supporting a shift from individual to public transport; stringent CO2 and exhaust (CO, NOx, PM) emissions as well as noise reduction objectives.
Hydrogen allows for the use of renewable energy, dramatic well to wheel emission reductions* which are a primary driver for future urban traffic electrification plans in the EU and very high operational flexibility.
Earlier EU programmes (CHIC, High VLOCity, HyTransit and 3EMotion) have shown a 75% price reduction of the bus since 1990 with volumes remaining small, opening up different pathways to full commercialisation as of 2020.
To achieve this objective, the commercialisation study, conducted by Roland Berger Strategy Consulting contracted by the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking recommends that a first step change that needs to be made is through:
an increase of volume by aggregating number of about 100 units
increased number of vehicles serviced per station
a coalition of cross the board cities and regions forming regional clusters throughout the EU member states, who are committed to deploying the technology in the H2020 time frame.
joint procurement as modern investment tool shall be applied to improve terms & conditions for operators and stability of supply for producers
Commitments thereto have been made jointly by the supply side in November 2014 (5 bus OEM’s) and by the demand side (30+ bus operators) in June 2015. Five bus OEM’s are developing next generation bus models to show the cost down potential and take the technology from a current TRL 6/7 (demos) to TRL 8/9 (semi and full commercialisation) level from now through the end of Horizon 2020.
The purpose of this bus validation topic is therefore to establish a committed coalition that can achieve the aggregate volume and a demonstration scale that is necessary to meet further cost reductions required for a full commercialisation of fuel cell bus technology and the associated infrastructure by 2020. FC bus manufacturers have indicated that a cumulative production volume of 500 to 1000 buses is required to trigger full commercial roll-out. This is a challenge both in terms of acquisition of the buses (large enough numbers to reduce costs) and their operation, and also the HRSs needed for such yield of hydrogen and its supply.
*See: Well-To-Wheels Report Version 4.a JEC Well-To-Wheels Analysis: Well-To-Wheels Analysis of Future Automotive Fuels and Powertrains in the European Context
Scope:
This topic calls for simultaneous deployment and demonstration of larger scale FC bus fleets in line with the recommendations of the FCH JU’s bus commercialisation roadmap in Europe until 2020*. The project will cover the roll-out of a set of fleets amounting to at least 100 FC buses consisting of at least 3 locations with minimum 20 buses per depot. The minimum number of buses per location/depot for additional locations should be 10. Concrete statements should be provided in the proposals regarding the willingness of operators to further expand the fleets after the project. The project will serve to analyse the operation of large fleets of buses and their impact on everyday heavy usage bus operation, including the specific purchasing mechanisms like e.g. joint procurement to efficiently commercialise innovative technology.
FC buses
The buses deployed within the project should have a high level of standardization and learning from previous projects shall reflect significantly in the availability of the buses. The buses are considered to be close to commercial readiness from both a technical maturity and an economic perspective.
The generation of FC buses deployed in this project shall at least have been tested in prior projects (EU & non-EU, minor system changes to improve availability are acceptable) in order to assure a reliable operation of the bus fleets leveraging existing experience and leading to more operating uptime.
Buses are expected to comply with the following requirements:
Buses can be FC-hybrid or full power FC (FC system as the dominating power source), but at least half of the energy required for performing their expected duty cycle should be provided from hydrogen.
The minimum operational period for any bus demonstrated in the project is 24 months, whereas in all cases arrangements for extending operation after the end of the project are expected and should be documented in the proposal as a matter of key importance. A minimum of 50% of all buses should be introduced in the first 2 years of the project and should be 36 months or 100,000km in operational service
Maximum funding: The funding per vehicle cannot exceed 200.000€ per standard bus [1] (12/13.5 m), 250.000 € per articulated bus (>18m), provided they are equipped with a full power FC system of at least 50kW. In addition, for range-extender units or other alternative solutions complying with the given requirements, the funding is limited to 1500€/kW installed FC system
Maximum price (for the customer): 650,000€ for a standard bus and less than 1,000,000€ for articulated buses
>20,000h vehicle operation lifetime initially, minimum 25,000h lifetime as project target
The key energy source of vehicles must be hydrogen in a fuel cell dominated or range extender architecture. At least half of the power requirement should be provided by the fuel cell
Fuel cell system MTBF [2] >2,500 km
Availability >90% on a fleet basis after an initial 6 month ramp-up phase (to be measured in available operation time excluding scheduled preventive maintenance)
Tank-to-wheel efficiency >42%, for buses measured in the SORT 1 & 2 drive cycles.
Series production ability as well as the cost reduction potential as a result of the project have to be demonstrated.
HRS
This topic focuses on the demonstration of larger hydrogen refuelling station for large bus fleets based on previous engineering research projects (min. > 20 buses and 400 kg refuelling capacity per day). The challenge is to maintain high levels of station availability, specify the right level of system redundancy and ensure fuel availability during the entire operation.
For the location(s) that begin testing fuel cell buses at a smaller scale, a pathway towards larger fuel cell bus fleets (>50) needs to be provided as a result of the project. Projects and cities with a clear strategic goal to increase their hydrogen bus fleet and projects with a higher buses/station ratio will have priority as the impact for the commercialisation will be bigger.
HRS are expected to comply with the following requirements:
HRS are to be designed to allow for cost effective operation in each location, including plans for scaling up as fleets expand
A target availability of the station of 98% (measured in usable operation time of the station providing redundancy for service and maintenance) excluding scheduled preventive maintenance
Inclusion of the HRS designs developed under earlier programmes (in particular the NewBusFuel project from the 2014 call) to show integration of concept and cost down potential of hydrogen production and storage for larger fleets as well as the potential to scale up capacity
The cost of dispensed hydrogen offered in the project needs to be consistent with the national or regional strategy on hydrogen pricing. Cost improvements due to increased hydrogen production capacity and especially higher utilization rates of the HRS is anticipated in the course of the project (target at the pump < 9 €/kg excl. taxes)
Hydrogen purity has to be at least 99.999 %
A maximum funding per large HRS (20 buses) is 1,200,000 € and smaller stations (10 buses) is 600,000 €, excluding on-site production equipment.
Overall
Beyond demonstration of the technology the participating cities shall engage in communication of their efforts to partner cities/regions in Europe and beyond through appropriate channels to share their experience within the project (e.g. UITP meeting/city conferences, etc.)
This topic includes funding caps which are clearly below the maximum funding rates applicable in the framework programme Horizon 2020 and the FCH 2 JU. This is done on purpose as beneficiaries are expected to obtain co-funding.
In order to facilitate co-funding and compliance with all the rules applicable to the different funding sources, beneficiaries are allowed to shift the capped budget from one cost item to another as long as (1) they comply with the rules applicable in the framework programme Horizon 2020 and the FCH 2 JU and (2) they remain under the budget defined by the funding caps.
Example: a beneficiary deploying 1 HRS and 20 12meter buses. The maximum reimbursement for this deployment is 1*€1.200.000 + 20*€200.000= €5.200.000. To facilitate co-funding, said beneficiary can shift the budget from the HRS to the buses or vice versa as long as the budget remains under 5.2M€ and complies with the reimbursement rules of the FCH 2 JU and all other applicable rules.
It is necessary that the project shows evidence for co-funding by national, regional or private sources in order to demonstrate a strong commitment towards clean propulsion and emission free public transport. Any such co-funding should be fully secured before the signature of the grant agreement to ensure timely realisation of the project.
Proposers should provide a clear evidence of:
political support for the project together with commitment to further involvement in the roll out must be provided as part of the proposal, through a Letter of Intent
a comprehensive exploitation plan for the project should also form part of the proposal.
Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html.
The consortium should include multiple bus service providers/operators, bus OEMs, refuelling infrastructure providers/operators, fuel retailers, industrial players, local and regional bodies, as appropriate and relevant to the effective delivery of the project.
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping Proposals should clearly demonstrate the commitment of OEMs to supply vehicles to the project. The involvement of SMEs is encouraged.
The following TRLs are at least required:
7 for FC buses at start of project
7 for the HRS at start of project.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 32 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 4-6 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.

[1] Basic 12m low entry, class 1 city bus, with 2 doors, air conditioning, min. 30 seats, traction batteries for operation on flat terrain, all IT equipment (except destination signs) delivered by the operator, manually operated ramp, delivered ex-factory OEM. Extra for special equipment excluded.
[2] MTBF: mean time between failure, failure means any incident caused by the vehicle which interrupts the operation of the vehicle
Expected Impact:
FC buses
According to previous investigations on fuel cell buses it is expected that the project leads to further cost reduction of FC-buses and the necessary power train components. The envisaged cost level for a standard 12m FC-bus (equipped with a full power FC-system) produced in larger numbers in 2020 is 600,000 Euro*. Further, the project needs to trigger uptake of FC-buses by European cities. In addition it is anticipated that larger fleets of buses create higher public awareness of the technology increasing interest in hydrogen and fuel cell solutions for public transport in general, stimulating further demand.
HRS
Hydrogen refuelling stations for larger fleets of fuel cell buses will be heavily utilised and therefore generate a bigger learning effect in comparison to underutilised stations for other applications. It shall increase the confidence of bus operators in reliable fuel supply and demonstrate the viability of fuel cells in public transport even in a full role out scenario, i.e. all buses at a depot run on hydrogen. Furthermore, fuel cell bus stations can occasionally be combined with refuelling points for other applications that might trigger awareness, understanding and demand for applications. Previous engineering research will contribute to successful implementation and execution of this project.
Overall
The project should deliver:
Lessons learnt from implementing and operating large hydrogen bus fleets for follower cities
Identification of bottlenecks – technical, organisational, structural, financial including RCS and formulation of recommendations on how to address these
Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the impact of the technology on public health and urban living (e.g. comparison against incumbent technology, in situ measurement etc.)
Professional dissemination of the activities of the project to the broad public is seen as a key part of the demonstration project. It should especially be foreseen to communicate the benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells in public transport. Regional authorities should support the project with communication.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Fuel cell system technology has already demonstrated its maturity for automotive application, but still does not meet the cost requirements for a broad market introduction. The reasons are proprietary system architectures and component concepts, too low volume and lack of a competitive chain of suppliers. Therefore a standardization of interfaces and components may be an efficient path to reduce cost and consequently accelerate market introduction of automotive fuel cell technology including qualification of a capable supplier base.
Whereas standardization of refuelling infrastructure is approaching maturity, on the fuel cell system component level the variance is still very high and needs more development. Each manufacturer of a fuel cell system develops and uses its own components and interfaces, mainly based on proprietary requirements, whereas the similarity of requirements appears to be potentially high (e.g. compare with “Auto Stack” specification). Components suitable for OEM-wide standardization include components of air supply, fuel supply, valves, sensors, cooling, water management, DC/DC converters, current connectors, etc. Alignment of requirements and standardization of these Balance-of-Plant components can help keep production costs low. In addition, some of these components affect safety classification (ASIL) of fuel cell systems and must be qualified and tested in order to comply with ASIL standards. In contrast, differentiation is expected to focus on fuel cell system architecture, fuel cell stack and system controls and therefore, these components should not be the focus of the targeted standardisation.
Current RCS are particularly based on manufacturing specification and should be simplified and adapted to performance oriented specifications.
Scope:  The objectives of this action are to:
•             Identify and select components or subsystems suitable for standardization of TRL 6 and higher
•             Differentiate between power-class-dependent and power-class-independent components
•             Benchmark concepts of components and subsystems respectively in conjunction with their operating range and higher
•             Align specifications and interfaces for each component and subsystem, respectively
•             Define and agree on standardized verification, validation and qualification test protocols
•             Select, modify and adapt components complying with the agreed specifications
•             Generate inputs for further development of advanced fuel cell system components in order to fulfil broader requirements of OEMs
•             Transfer of proposals for standardized Balance-of-Plant-components to industry codes & standards and regulations
•             Involve suppliers capable of fulfilling automotive standards
Expected impact:             The expected milestones are:
•             Components and subsystems identified and selected for standardization in scope of this project
•             Compilation of components / subsystems according to their dependence /independence on a power-class
•             Specifications and interfaces are aligned
•             Test procedures and protocols are defined
•             Suitable samples of standardized components are available and testing conducted
•             Test reports and corresponding conclusions provided
•             Viable supply chain identified
•             Whitepapers for RCS prepared
A standardization of Balance-of-Plant components will lead to aligned common interfaces and specifications and will enable higher production volumes for such components, accelerating development of a competitive supplier market, which will in turn enable cost reduction and likely, commercialisation. Furthermore, due to reduced variance of every standardized component, the effort for certification will also be reduced, which allows for an additional cost reduction."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Rail line electrification is in general limited due to economic feasibility. Today, half of EU’s rail lines are not electrified and are operated by diesel trains which generate substantial air pollution and noise. In some cases, diesel trains can also operate on electrified portions of partially electrified lines. Such trains include regional passenger trains, shunting or main line locomotives.
In recent years, some FCH passenger train prototypes have been developed and tested. The interest of many Public Transport Authorities (PTAs), both in EU and abroad for this technology has led to orders being placed in Austria and Germany for small fleets of vehicles to be put into service in 2021 – 2023. Several different OEMs are therefore committed to deliver FCH powered trains and intend to enter the market. As outlined in the common FCH 2 JU & S2R JU study on “Use of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen in the Railway Environment” [40], FC technology provides a flexible, zero-emission and potentially cost-competitive solution to replace diesel trains while FCH trains perform to the rail system specifications as well as the diesel technology can. The most mature FCH application, i.e. Multiple Units, has the potential to become cost competitive with diesel-powered trains in the short term (can potentially replace 30 % of diesel volumes as the most market-ready application by 2030), followed by the Shunters and Mainline Locomotives which still need further technology development. Therefore, FCH technology needs to take a systemic approach to the rail environment and engage simultaneously on different fronts for accelerated deployment.
Despite this increasing interest, many challenges remain for fuel cell trains to be considered a competitive alternative to diesel trains, which should be addressed by this topic:
The regulatory environment for trains remains fragmented, including both European (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) and national (NNTR – Notified National Technical Rules) technical requirements while today several types of trains are required to address the complete European market. It is estimated that FCH powered trains will face the same market fragmentation which could lead to high fixed costs for each first project in a new normative environment for all types of application;
Specific standards need to be established with railway safety agencies, operators, rolling stock manufacturers and fuel cell manufacturers on safety, installation and performance testing (as usually done in IEC TC105 [41]) in order to facilitate commercialization across European countries and homologation by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) [42];
Deployment of traditional line electrification programs is still ongoing. These costly investments, while taking decades to materialize, question also the long-term residual value of train fleets that do not use overhead line electrification. Therefore, bi-mode capability (hydrogen + catenary) could improve marketability and residual value of FCH trains;
FCH train cost competitiveness against diesel train could be increased by improving the on-board components and sub-systems (improving the train autonomy and its cost).

Scope:
The topic aims to support the development of a fuel cell powered train prototype that addresses one of the three railway segments identified by the above-mentioned study: regional passenger trains, shunting or main line locomotives. The project should therefore support:
1. The design and manufacture of an innovative prototype:
Using FCH traction only or combining FCH traction and electric pantograph;
Both compressed hydrogen on-board storage solutions (e.g. at 350 or 700 bars) or liquid hydrogen should be explored and considered in scope of the topic;
Test, validate and carry out the homologation (at EU level, covering at least three Member States) of such a prototype; the testing duration and testing environment should progress the technology to reach TRL7;
The operational performance of the prototype (autonomy, fuelling downtime) should be competitive with existing diesel-based designs;
2. Propose a normative framework for the placement on the market of trains using FCH propulsion:
Identify the gaps in the current applicable regulatory and voluntary framework (TSI and EN);
Propose modifications of relevant standards and TSIs to enable obtaining authorization to place on the market of FCH and FCH bi-mode trains, to be submitted to CEN, CENELEC and the European Union Agency for Railways.
The project should deliver an innovative prototype and therefore go beyond those currently in operation/testing.
Only the design and engineering of the prototype are considered within the scope of the topic, including the building of the fuel cell based power train and hydrogen storage. Other activities, (e.g. train development etc) might be part of the project but shall not be considered within the scope of the topic.
The project should consider developing the necessary supply chain with focus on a healthy and diversified EU value chains (e.g. drivetrain, FC stacks and systems, tanks among others) and second sources for related services, including availability of trained personnel, spare parts etc. in order to bring this technology on a parity with conventional technologies.

Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
“CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform [43] to ensure that the hydrogen produced and dispensed at the HRS is of renewable nature.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 10 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.

Expected Impact:
Due to the openness of the topic to various type of applications, KPIs can be different depending on the selected application. Proposals should therefore demonstrate ambitious goals aligned with the technical KPIs included in the FCH 2 JU MAWP and in particular its Addendum [44], while also making reference to the common JUs study on “Use of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen in the Railway Environment” to define further specific targets. Project proposals should also address the market size addressed by the prototype, based on the 2018 edition of the UNIFE World Rail Market Study [45] as part of the potential impact.
In addition, the following impact is expected:

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Membrane-Electrode Assembly (MEA) is at the core of the PEMFC. Improvements of MEA components and Bipolar Plates (BPPs) are required for further cost reduction and to increase performance and durability of next generation of PEMFC stacks. MEA components comprise membrane, ionomers, catalysts and their supports, conductive electrode agents, gas diffusion layers (GDLs) including microporous layers (MPLs). Development of lower cost and durable materials (substrate and coating) and including BPP stable coatings may contribute significantly to meet cost targets required for commercialization.
A wide range of MEA components have already demonstrated their maturity for automotive application and many of them are commercially available. Nevertheless, integrated in a stack, these components do not yet meet the performance and durability at low cost requirements for a broad market introduction despite very promising innovative results achieved during previous projects funded by the previous FCH JU calls. The main reason is that different competitive phenomena occur in a PEMFC stack such as electrochemistry at catalyst and active layer level, water management in all components between bipolar plates and membrane, and heat management without a global optimization of the fuel cell core component architecture.
Therefore, there is a continuing need to develop existing concepts for the key MEA components such as catalyst, membrane, and GDL, through MEA designs and products demonstrating consistently improved performance (high power density), stability (lifetime with acceptable decay rates), and cost reduction (lowered precious metal loadings) that meet commercialization targets for FCVs. This approach is complementary to that targeted in the topic FCH-01.2-2014 “Cell and stack components, stack and system manufacturing technologies and quality assurance” from the previous call as upstream developments.
In order to reach the OEMs’ requirements for transport application, it is now necessary to design and evaluate strengthened component architecture based either on commercial or innovative components consistent with available industrial processes. To reach this goal, a special attention has to be paid to interface and interaction between all components with new integration concepts and designs.
Scope:
In order to demonstrate the validity of the individual component improvements despite the competing electrochemical phenomena, demonstration of a full sized stack is mandatory. The following key objectives must be addressed by the project collaboration:
Validate performance and durability of single cells or small stacks with adequate cross section area for automotive applications (> 150 cm2). Both experimental and modelling evaluation has to be taken into consideration
Understand component and stack degradation mechanisms in real operating conditions using both experimental and modelling approaches
Align specifications and interfaces for each component and architecture with special attention to interface optimisation between each component (GDL/electrodes, electrodes/membranes, BP/MEA…)
Define, achieve and evaluate new architectures and prototypes optimizing electrochemistry, water and heat management
Generate inputs for further development of advanced fuel cell system components in order to fulfil broader requirements of OEMs
Transfer of proposals for optimization of Balance-of-Plant components development according to optimized component operating conditions.
The following optional objectives can also be addressed by the project collaboration:
Select, modify and adapt components and associated production processes complying with the agreed operations conditions
Develop new synthesis and manufacturing methods for MEA components (i.e. catalyst layers, gas diffusion layers…) with optimised structure consistent with operating conditions in order to increase catalyst utilization and durability
Develop stack prototypes optimized for the assembling in the process chain Benchmark components and architectures respectively with respect to the operating conditions (passenger cars, buses, material handling equipment…)
Identify the most suitable standardized protocols, to qualify components
Improve mass manufacturing methods for sheet metal BPP, low cost coatings and sealing
Investigate dismantling of components and recycling of the critical materials
Expected Impact:
Identify and select PEMFC components suitable to reach the main followings KPIs as described in the MAWP:
Power density: 1 W/cm2 at 1.5 A/cm2 (at BoL= Begin of Life)
Durability: > 6,000 hours (with a nominal power loss < 10 %)
FC stack production cost: 50 €/kW at 50 000 units/year production rate
The following key results must be achieved by the project collaboration:
Identification and selection of components and their architectures to reach OEM requirements correlated with degradation mechanisms in real operating conditions by means of combined virtual (simulation based) and experimental techniques
Development of catalysts and electrode layers with higher mass activity and increased durability allowing for significant reduction in precious metal catalyst loadings or the use of low cost non-platinum group metal catalysts. These should be corrosion resistant, preferably compatible with higher temperature operation (about 120°C) and able to mitigate the consequence of fuel starvation events
Development of GDLs and MPLs designed for increased diffusivity, improved water management and heat conduction. GDL thickness has to minimized but be compatible with production in high volumes
Design of BPPs with optimised interface with new MEAs in terms of geometry, protective and conductive coating for long lifetime, corrosion stability and production process
Design of high performance MEAs using above components. Development of membrane materials suitable for automotive applications (low RH, higher temperature and dynamic load cycling operation)
Techno-economic assessment showing that material, design, components & prototypes are compatible with the stringent cost and durability targets for commercialization of FCEVs
The following optional results can be considered by the project collaboration:
Demonstrate performances and durability using accelerated test protocols as defined in previous JTI projects (FCTESTNET, FCTESQA, STACKTEST) and the current harmonisation exercise
Validate the full value chain of components from the manufacturing up to the stack integration. Proposed components and prototypes should be optimised for easy dismantling and recycling of materials at the end of their active life
Develop low cost seals with low O2 permeation rates
Standardization potential of components consistent with higher production volumes"

Specific challenge: There has been considerable progress with fuel cell stack designs to meet operational requirements, but many still fall short in terms of manufacturability, production efficiency and production cost. These shortfalls need to be addressed before the full potential of the technology can be realized and commercial market opportunities in the transport sector can be taken up.
This topic is intended to include development and validation activities for existing cell and stack design and material utilisation. The objective of overcoming final stage challenges to achieve operational improvements (robustness, performance, cost targets relevant within the Transport application area, lifetime), leading to and in combination with design for manufacture and production techniques for ease of automated assembly, increased output volumes and reduced reject / fault rates and reduced production costs.
Scope:  The scope of work covers improvements to existing, validated designs for cells, at the individual cell level and at the cell component level (e.g., for BPP and development of membranes, catalyst coated membranes, electrodes and production techniques commensurate with the production of high quality, fully integrated membrane electrode assemblies) and at the stack level to meet robustness, efficiency power density, cost and enhanced lifetime objectives. The scope specifically includes improvements in cell and stack manufacturing, assembly and QA methods that support the same objectives. The TRL at commencement for cells and cell components must be at TRL 5 or above and for stack manufacturing, assembly and QA methods must be at a minimum of TRL 5 or preferably at TRL 6. 
The topic is intended to cover alternative fuel cell solutions which, for the Transport pillar, is expected to cover PEM-based designs only. It is specifically not intended to cover basic research on new materials or on fundamentally new cell and stack designs.
Project proposals should focus on development work utilising existing stack, stack material and cell component designs which, in line with the TRL 5 starting point requirement, will have already been tested and validated against automotive requirements.
Projects are expected to cover top-level objectives such as:
•             Simplification of design and manufacturing methods of cell components, cells, stacks and/or stack modules (core power generation units)
•             Cell and stack design improvements, such as increasing robustness, performance, power density, and efficiency and/or reducing cost against current automotive designs that have been validated and meet or exceed the TRL 5 level
•             Improvement of existing manufacturing methods to increase manufacturing yield and reduce product variation and manufacturing cost (QA strategies)
•             Validation of existing manufacturing methods to increase robustness, manufacturing yield and reduce product variation and manufacturing cost (QA strategies)
•             Testing and validation of critical manufacturing sub-processes (low yield/high cost)
•             Identification of manufacturing failure modes and implementation of manufacturing control plans to redress these failure modes
Proposals under this topic need to identify the current baseline for technology specific gaps and to set ambitious targets for meeting critical cost, technical and manufacture / production parameters - and their improvement over the state of the art -  together with the development strategy and rationale for the proposed cell component, cell and stack development / manufacturing activities.
Expected impact: The expected outcome will need to include a substantial improvement over the state of the art of the following items:
•             Electrical efficiency of relevant individual components, and stacks over the state of the art
•             Robustness, including increased lifetime
•             Demonstration of the potential to achieve longer run times under relevant drive cycle conditions required to meet market entry requirements of 5,000 hours
•             Cost reductions consistent with market acceptance requirements for relevant transport applications for passenger vehicles of more than 500 €/kW down to 150 €/kW at the FC system level
•             Manufacturing methods in terms of yield and cost, reducing stack scrap rate (initially to 10% with the objective to reduce it to less than 5%)  by the end of the project
•             Decreased materials consumption or/and achieve a higher power density in line with progression from the minimum TRL 5 to TRL 6 or beyond
All projects must produce validated evidence of lifetimes, cost targets, high efficiencies throughout life and advances in manufacturing methods, sub and full assembly approaches and QA impacts."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The typical drive cycles of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are discontinuous, characterized by steep and unscheduled load transients, leading to an increased degradation rate compared to fuel cells used for most stationary applications. Thus, the highly dynamic nature of the drive patterns shortens the lifetime of automotive fuel cells, and lifetime limitations remain one of the key challenges for FCEV commercialization by adding to high total cost of ownership (TCO). It is, hence, urgently needed to address the issues of diagnostics and control which are expected to have a major impact on the competitiveness of FCEVs compared to conventional propulsion technologies. Diagnostics include the detection of faults/problems as well as identification of what is causing the faults/problem. Control includes the scheduling of power production, management of hybridisation strategies, and management of ancillary units.
Scope:
The project will focus on reducing the degradation to a minimum by means of control actions guided by condition monitoring and diagnostics. Activities will be devoted to developing diagnostics and control-based solutions to extend the lifetime of the present generation of automotive fuel cell systems, based on one hand, on the current scientific knowledge in degradation of fuel cells and balance-of-plant (BoP) components and, on the other hand, on feedback from past and on-going projects with the potential application also for future generations of automotive fuel cells.
The project is aimed at addressing the following objectives:
Enhanced understanding of component and stack degradation mechanisms in real operating conditions using both experimental and modelling approaches in order to define the most suitable and efficient monitoring and diagnostic tools
Development of appropriate monitoring and diagnostic methods for observing degradation of automotive fuel cells and BoP components, requiring no or only minor modifications to existing systems to be implemented
Development of cost-effective control methods for automotive fuel cell systems, with the ability of minimising the progress of degradation in fuel cells when integrated with the diagnostic methods mentioned above; Preferentially, these methods should be modular, easily portable to other systems and not tied to a specific technology or design
Implementation of the developed diagnostics and control systems in a prototype with a special focus of power management between FC system and battery pack. The implementation will be chosen among the classes of FCEVs identified in the MAWP: passenger cars and buses
Demonstration of the prototype in operation, preferably in relevant environmental conditions, for a length of time sufficient to quantify the gains in terms of system lifetime obtained by the implementation of the new diagnostics and control system
Validation of the applicability of the developed methods on future generations of fuel-cell systems
The FC stack hardware may also be within the scope to be funded, although it is not the focus of the innovation. The FC stack is required to demonstrate the system level performance and may therefore be adapted from existing technology.
Expected Impact:
Reduce the fuel cell system cost including the additional cost of the diagnostics and control system, below the following thresholds, corresponding to the 2020 FCH2 JU targets:
100 €/kW for passenger cars at 50,000 units
1000 €/kW (or 500 €/kW)[1] for buses at 200 units
Attain the FCH 2 JU targets for lifetime of automotive fuel cell systems for 2020; since several of these targets would require one or two years to validate in real time, while validation with real time operation is preferred, they may also be validated with proven accelerated protocols or proven prognostic methods:
6,000 h for passenger cars
15,000 h (or 2 x 8000 h)[2] for buses
[1]Depending whether the bus system will be composed by one larger bus fuel cell stack or two passenger car stacks
[2]Depending whether the bus system will be composed by one larger bus fuel cell stack or two passenger car stacks, and hence will have to be replaced once during the lifetime targets."

Specific challenge:          A number of demonstration projects have already provided evidence about the maturity of fuel cell technology but further activities are necessary to fulfil automotive standards and requirements. As a result, it is clear that in order to enable high volume production of fuel cell systems for market entry scenarios of upcoming years, cost optimized, compact and efficient systems and system components as e.g. fuel cell stack, the air supply module, the anode module and the thermal management system are essential for the success of fuel cell based mobility solutions. Technology assessments suggest that there are still considerable potentials for improvements in terms of functionality, efficiency, manufacturability and cost for automotive application.
Scope:  The objective of this action is to develop low cost fuel cell system components for automotive application by adopting latest system and component level engineering methodologies and tools. All balance of plant components are addressed such as the air-cathode/exhaust module (air compressor/exhaust turbine), the anode module with recirculation, the air humidifier and processing unit as well as auxiliary components (valves, sensors, interfaces) for both reactant loops and the thermal management system and components. In order to exploit the results of projects on a broader basis, the analysis and development tools and environments further developed should be made applicable also for corresponding developments – particularly automated and accelerated testing procedures including related testing environments.
Components developed shall be tested and evaluated by dedicated component and system testing for automotive usage. After key component and system testing of some first samples the component shall be further developed towards the target for the automotive fuel cell system application. Further samples need to be built and tested on component and system level. Design-to-cost methodologies shall be applied to analyse cost and to identify cost reduction opportunities for further improvements of the respective components.
•             As an initial assessment a comparison of the relative merits of different technologies shall be performed by deploying advanced testing and simulation methods (on system and component level).
•             Particularly, the potential of new solutions in terms of packaging (improvement of gravimetric and volumetric power density), durability and low cost production should be addressed already in the virtual development phase by application of suitable tools (e.g. cost and reliability assessments).
•             Fuel cell component configurations shall demonstrate compliance with typical automotive environments, such as wide load range, high dynamics, shock and vibrations, sub-zero and hot environments, frequent start / stop cycles to achieve high reliability and long life as well as addressing energy density and efficiency criteria. Application of combined physical and virtual testing methodologies is encouraged.
•             The development activities on fuel cell BoP-components shall reflect the standard automotive development processes, leading to a possible continuation of the project to higher volume. These investigations should also include validation of reliability and durability targets envisaged by application of standard industrial methods. Test and comparison have to refer to a mid-class European car under typical certification and OEM test development cycles.
•             The new solutions for the components to be investigated have to show the potential for improvements of reliability on component and system level. Particularly the interaction of the newly developed components and subsystems with the fuel cell stack regarding the extension of durability and the elimination of critical degradation processes should be part of the validation - preferably proved by dedicated diagnostic devices. Such diagnostic techniques could potentially be also part of later on-board-diagnostics (OBD).
The project shall also provide advanced analysis and concepts for further system simplification, ease of manufacturing and cost reduction reflecting typical automotive volumes. Along with the components, also development and production environments should be applied and identified regarding subsequent mass products.
Expected impact:             The main impacts are:
•             Verification of components on test stations
•             Validation of components on the level of a fuel cell system

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Typical PEMFC systems still have important challenges before mass production in transportation may be realised, namely cost, reliability and durability. Some of these challenges can be tackled improving the system components as well as by introducing novel system configurations.
While the technical feasibility has been demonstrated in several configurations, a major challenge remains on the high cost of these solutions due to low production volumes, the use of expensive materials and designs not suitable for automated manufacturing. Moreover, the supply chain for some components is still not in place.
Some of the specific outstanding issues concern the freeze start that is still too long and not reliable for low cost stacks and the water management at low temperatures and subsequent freeze preparation. Some failure modes for key components such as compressor air bearings have still to be solved. Packaging in combination with cost effective solutions remain an issue in view of future integration in mass production of the automotive industry.
In addition, the fuel cell system, power degradation is still too high, caused by events such as start-up/shut-down, fuel starvation and potential cycling. With novel system architecture and component designs, the FC degradation can be reduced to levels equivalent to incumbent technologies.
The biggest cost-down leverage in a FC system is on the cathode side: the components are usually the most expensive and the ones with the highest parasitic power and strongest impact to FC performance.
Additionally, the automotive supply chain needs to be established for some of the components and should be further supported by bringing together OEM and potential n-Tier suppliers in development projects such as the present one.
Scope:
The project should focus on the improved industrialization-ready designs of high efficiency and low cost Balance-of-Plant (BoP) PEMFC system components on the cathode side (compressor, humidification, intercooler, valves, and turbine/expander). The FC stack is also within the scope to be funded, although it is not the focus of the innovation. The FC stack is required to demonstrate the system level performance and may therefore be adapted from existing technology.
Development of a new generation of systems using cost engineering to identify cost reduction potentials for each component and perform design-to-cost activities and trade-offs with other BoP components. As an example: low O2 permeation valves can be used to reduce O2 ingress into the stack and thus decreasing start-up (SU) degradation. The project must include durability testing of the components (or testing at the system level if meaningful) under automotive conditions.
The project must address the following key issues:
Novel system prototypes that eliminate or reduce issues currently experienced with PEMFC systems such as voltage cycling, SU/SD corrosion which leads to increased degradation
Freeze start design and system component layout to minimize water pooling and consequent ice blockages and reduction of thermal mass to enable faster start up at sub-zero temperatures
Air compressor prototypes that simultaneously
provide higher efficiency at max load point to enable reduction of parasitic power while providing increased durability
meet automotive dynamic requirements (0-90% power in 0,5s)
improve flow vs. pressure operating window at low current densities
Optionally the project can also address the following issues:
Turbine/expanders prototypes that reduce parasitic losses with high recovery efficiency.
New humidification prototypes that simultaneously
improve water transfer rates between wet and dry side
improve durability to meet automotive requirements of 6,000h
minimize packaging space
reduce pressure drop
Intercoolers (gas-to-gas or gas-to-liquid) that simultaneously
high thermal transfer efficiency
minimize package space
reduce pressure drop
To insure the usefulness of the results for the automotive industry, the following methodologies are required:
Automotive development methods, design to cost, reliability and robustness methods
Detailed component level simulation for analysis and optimization (e.g. of multiphase transport and phase transition processes including multi-component diffusion and mixing phenomena of humidifiers etc.)
Sub-system and system level simulation for component specification and assessment of overall performance of different component configurations
Automated-/hardware-in-the-loop-/accelerated testing methods
Expected Impact:
By addressing design to manufacturing and cost engineering tools, further cost-down potential should be reached on the main BoP components, thus bringing costs in line with positive business cases at the system level, not only for OEMs but also for the entire supply chain.
The project must show that the proposed BoP solutions support the targets at the FC system level. Details on the trade-offs between stack and BoPs including cost estimation are expected. All projects must also produce validated evidence of lifetimes; cost targets and efficiencies throughout life.
The following KPIs are expected to be reached at the FC system level:
FC system production cost: 100 €/kW at 50 000 units/year production rate
Maximum power degradation of 10% after 6000 h for passenger cars
Cold Start: Improved freeze start up performance and reliability closer to standard automotive conditions"

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Today’s on board hydrogen storage systems for fuel cell powered vehicles do not yet meet cost and performance targets for a broader market introduction, neither for light nor for  heavy duty vehicles. This is due to low production volume, proprietary system design, component concepts which are not suitable for mass production and the non-existence of a competitive supplier market.
While in the field of hydrogen infrastructure and supply standardisation activities are in a more advanced state, on the on board storage component level the variety of component designs is still very high. Such components are for example the pressure vessel, the on-tank valve, the Pressure Regulation Devices, the pressure regulator, hydrogen pressure and temperature sensors, the fittings and the seals of the high pressure lines.
From a customer’s point of view these components do not lead to a competitive advantage of one vehicle manufacturer over another as long as the system works within its specification.
A standardisation of systems, processes and components is therefore an efficient means to accelerate market introduction of automotive hydrogen storage technology including qualification of a capable supplier base. Standardisation of hydrogen storage components will lead to generally agreed interfaces and specifications and ultimately to higher production volumes of such components.
Scope:  The hydrogen storage technologies that are closest to the market are currently the 70 MPa compressed hydrogen storage for passenger cars and 35 MPa compressed hydrogen storage for vans and heavy duty vehicles. New storage concepts (cryo-compressed hydrogen storage at 30 MPa) are considered within the scope of this topic, provided that these fulfil all requirements for automotive applications. The work should target a reduction in terms of variety of components and modular designs aiming at decreased development time and cost and facilitating certification.
The work items should be the following:
•             Identification and selection of on board storage system components (sub systems) with the objective of no competitive advantage / differentiation for the OEMs
•             Alignment of specifications and interfaces for each component / sub system
•             Definition and agreement of standardized test procedures, taking into consideration the standards of the EU and of relevant non EU countries (e.g. Japan, USA)
•             Generation of input for further development of each component in order to respond to requirements of OEMs and concepts for modular design
•             Benchmarking of component concepts
•             Selection, modification and development of components complying with the agreed specifications
•             Evaluation of possible cost reductions with novel standardized components
•             Proposals for standardized hydrogen storage system components to be transferred to industry standards, codes and regulations
Current TRL for most storage components is between 4 and 6. The objective of the proposed topic would be to raise the TRL by 2, achieving a range of 6 to 8 depending on the individual components and sub systems.
Expected impact:
•             A range of hydrogen storage components suitable for standardization on a world-wide level
•             Standardized interfaces between selected components and other components of the hydrogen storage system and the drive train
•             Accepted test procedures for selected components, like those developed by the JRC.
•             Demonstration of a cost reduction to 800 €/kg H2 stored through standardized components and interfaces in mass production
•             Standards for selected components, ready to be transferred to industry standards, codes and regulations

The low temperature PEMFC technology for road applications are gaining more and more traction and investment, and these activities can have a very positive impact on other segments by making available components and systems of lower cost and more robustness to the market – along with increased sales volumes. The goal of this topic is to facilitate that these benefits are transferred to early niche markets within other applications. It is important to dedicate specific focused activities to make this happen.
An advanced level of technology readiness has been achieved for specific non-road transport applications, within material handling vehicles. These are close to market introduction in Europe, although in other markets about 6,000 vehicles are reported to be in operation, with significant public financial support for demonstration before market introduction. These are a not priority for this Pillar in view of their limited contribution to meet key transport policy objectives. The low temperature PEMFC technology and components developed for road transport may be used as the basis for other non-road applications. This could lead to a significant cost reduction, improved affordability and reliability. These systems and components from road transport need to be adapted to the specific non-road special needs. Identification of the needed adaptation of specific FC road vehicle drive train components for main propulsion for any vehicles but passenger cars and buses should be addressed in this topic.
On-road FC drive train components and systems are designed, developed and tested for on-road use in Europe’s climatic conditions spanning from high summer temperatures to sub-zero winter temperatures. Non-road applications will benefit from the implementation and adaptation of the knowhow and different applications from on-road FC drive trains in order to operate also in European out-door climate including more severe operating conditions with a higher lifetime.
Scope:
The overall objective of the projects in this topic is to bring non-road vehicles from TRL 4 to TRL 6. The achievement will be based on adaptation of road LT PEM Fuel Cell system components to non-road vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, airport ground vehicles, trains, harbour taxies and smaller ships as substitutes to battery systems and ICE systems on pre-existing vehicles/vessels and non-road vehicles/vessels. Any kind of applications could be addressed such as ships, trains and aircraft. Material handling vehicles are considered outside the scope of this topic.
Examples of adaptation of pre-existing components devoted to cars and buses could be:
The size and/or the catalyst loading of MEA,
Alternative high resistant coating on metallic bipolar plates used for automotive application,
Power management and hybridization technology
but produced with the same processes as used for cars and buses in order to increase the scale effect but taking into account specific size restriction with more severe operating conditions (corrosion, temperature…)
The achievements should be validated on the economic and environmental model versus reference battery vehicles and ICE solutions.
The on-road vehicles EU outdoor capabilities can be implemented in non-road vehicles
Hydrogen storage technology transferred to the non-road segment
Low temperature PEMFC stacks and components can be shared between several applications
BoP components from on-road can be adapted
Power and control strategies adapted
Expected Impact:
The technical goals of this topic are:
Identify components and systems where the development, learning and volume from road vehicles can be transferred to non-road vehicles
Identify ways to adapt components and systems for specific non-road applications
Identify value proposition of each component and sub-system and prioritize efforts to implement or redesign components for implementation in non-road vehicles
Implement chosen components and sub-systems in non-road fuel cell power unit
The project should meet the technical milestone from the MAWP in 2020:
Specific FC system cost: < 1200 €/kW @ 10kW
Hydrogen storage system cost: < 750 €/kg H2
Lifetime: > 10 000 h

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Major car manufacturers aim for a gradual market deployment of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) with 700 bar on-board storage in the coming years. Such deployment requires availability of a cost effective and reliable hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. State-of-the-art hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) technologies show part-wise unsatisfactory reliability reducing the availability of hydrogen as fuel for FCEV drivers related to failures in compressors, pumps and other vital parts. End user satisfaction is a key success factor for FCEV deployment especially in the early phase when the number of HRSs is low. Moreover, the relatively high CAPEX of HRSs is related to costly components and to high HRS complexity. Simplifications in system design, development of modular solutions and novel concepts for reducing the number of required components constitute viable pathways towards lower cost hydrogen supply. At low dispensed volumes the CAPEX and HRS maintenance contributes significantly to the hydrogen fuel cost. As the number of FCEVs increases, next generation HRS should be expandable to capacities following the demand for hydrogen. Last, but not least, there is a significant potential for improving the overall refuelling energy efficiency, thereby reducing the OPEX, which is required to reach the targeted fuel supply cost.
Scope:  Project(s) should conduct R&D, engineering, prototype manufacturing and/or laboratory testing of key components or complete HRS systems with the aim to further reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve and verify availability and refuelling performance. The focus of these activities needs to ensure that remaining hurdles for commercialisation and specific market requirements are appropriately addressed with the best possible technological solution.  For components the project efforts should focus on technologies with a current TRL of at least 3 and ensure an increase during the project of at least up to TRL 5. For HRS systems project efforts should focus on technologies or systems with a current TRL of at least 4 and ensure an increase during the project of up to at least TRL 6.
The scope of potential topic(s) to be addressed includes among others (addressing of several is possible):
Key components
•             R&D and optimization should primarily focus on cost, efficiency, capacity, reliability, maintenance, operation and performance for components such as:
o             Compression components
o             Storage components
o             Cooling and refuelling components
o             Regulation and control systems
o             Other supporting components
•             and may include additional aspects such as
o             Monitoring and communication systems, such as real time availability of the service station and other web services  
o             Other components relevant for parameters such as hydrogen quality and metering accuracy may also be addressed
The scope must include multiple key components (at least 3) in order to maximise the impact of the project.
Complete HRS systems
•             R&D and design of larger scale systems designed for high utilization and reliable operation with a focus on additional cost reduction, system efficiency, reliability, performance and market requirements
•             Construction and testing of full scale laboratory or pilot systems to validate cost reduction, efficiency and in particular reliability and performance at high utilisation rates in daily operation
Project(s) should take into consideration results of previously supported FCH JU projects that may be relevant for the topic, e.g. failure experiences, and performance indicators.
Expected impact: Newly developed and laboratory or pilot validated HRS key components and/or complete HRS systems fulfilling the following MAWP 2017 targets:
•             CAPEX and OPEX costs that enable a feasible roll-out of infrastructure taking into account relevant national/regional market support mechanisms. CAPEX target to be reached within the project in is EUR 0.6-1.8 million per HRS depending on capacity if full HRS systems are addressed. OPEX targets for the dispensing cost should validate that economically feasible operation of the HRS at sufficient utilisation can be achieved at a targeted cost of hydrogen delivered to the HRS of 5.5€/kg. Proposals must document current TRL of at least 4, outlining clearly the anticipated capacity and progress to be achieved within the project. Construction and test of laboratory or pilot HRS systems could be used to verify CAPEX and OPEX achievements.
Availability & performance that meets market requirements when used at full scale at high utilization rates on a daily basis. The developed components should demonstrate  >98% availability and close to 100% performance always offering end-users a fast and high state-of-charge refuelling in accordance with SAE J2601. Other performance parameters such as hydrogen quality and metering accuracy may also be addressed. For HRS systems, construction of laboratory validation systems could be used to verify availability and performance targets, at full scale and under high utilization conditions."

Implemented energy policies have the objective of producing 65% of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2050, and of reducing emissions of CO2 linked to energy production by 50%.
The rapid deployment of wind power and solar energy sources contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of the electricity grid. However, wind power and solar energy are resources dependent on meteorological conditions and their instability poses a number of problems for functioning of the electrical grid, in terms of stabilisation mechanisms, regulation and offsetting. The bottlenecks in the electricity supply system result from an excess of renewable energy which cannot be transferred to the grid and that is consequently curtailed by the operators of the supply grid, in order to balance the power produced and demand for energy and/or to permit the allocation of electricity deriving from other sources
Considerable investments in transport and distribution infrastructure will be necessary in the forthcoming years. In its global energy prospects, the International Energy Agency forecasts that total investments in transport and distribution (T&D) infrastructure will amount to US$ 6.817 billion during the period 2014-2035.
The postponement over time of transport and distribution infrastructure is possible by using storage resources to absorb power exceeding the capacity of a T&D line and returning it at a subsequent point, when the available T&D capacities permit. The upgrading of T&D resources generally translates into high fixed costs, while relatively limited storage resources allow a delay in (or even avoidance of) the investments which would otherwise be necessary.
Hydrogen can play a significant role for the support to the electricity grid, for peak shifting and demand response.
Current electrolysers are designed for high efficiency at their operating design point, at typically close to 100% load, and to run continuously. Providing energy services is expected to require start-stop and dynamic operation and high efficiency across much of the load curve. The electrolyser would have to follow the variable generation profile of renewable sources locally available and be adapted to the intermittent profile of electricity supply. It could be used also as an energy system able to maximize the energy self-consumption of entire districts in a municipal area or industry park, relying as much as possible on renewable sources locally available, while being grid connected for security of supply.
Scope:
Proposal must address the following objectives:
Development of electrolysers from 100 to 500 kW to provide grid services. Fact based assessment of specifications, supported by experimental evidences (i.e. from existing facilities, especially interaction with the grid and renewable electricity sources), is highly valuable
System and component optimization for partial load operation, from 20% (with a minimum efficiency of 50%) to 120%
System and component optimization for highly dynamic operation
ramp-up rates of less than 2 seconds going from 20% to 100% of nominal power,
warm start-up
cold start-up
standby behaviour, i.e. maximum of 5% of nominal power in standby mode
Control system designed to enhance interaction with the grid and renewable sources
Proposals could address the additional following objectives:
System engineering and improvements in manufacturing process for decreasing costs down to 3.7M€/tpd, contributing to system simplification, cost reduction, material use minimisation or that put in place a path to volume manufacturing
Technology to be tested in the field for at least 6 months to validate the development achieved. The method utilized should be illustrated in the proposal
Expected Impact:
Address business cases and applications where the Distributed Hydrogen Production may have a significant impact
As reported in the MAWP, target KPIs on cost per nominal power for alkaline and PEM electrolysers will be considered

The establishment of the hydrogen economy is constrained by different factors, such as handling and storage. On the other hand, hydrogen could be used in large amounts to synthetize gas and liquid hydrocarbons, whose system of storage and distribution are well established. Co-electrolysis of water and CO2 to produce H2 and CO is one of the most promising ways to convert electricity into a syngas. Water plus CO2 co-electrolysis constitutes the corner point of power-to-chemicals and power-to-fuel strategies, for green chemicals, CO2 recovery and electricity storage at large scale. Indicatively, Power to Gas, by means of the methane as energetic carrier, is a good example and the co-electrolysis process to produce hydrogen and CO as hydrocarbon precursors, is a very promising way on that.
The main challenge here addressed is to store excess renewable electricity in the form of hydrogen and CO. By producing syngas, co-electrolysis would enable various storage options like methanation and storage in liquid organic carriers. Alternatively the CO in the syngas can be easily converted to hydrogen via water-gas-shift. Co-electrolysis could therefore become a more efficient way of producing hydrogen from electricity. This topic will contribute to hydrogen carriers, using CO2. The produced syngas, CO plus hydrogen, is again in the scope for multiple ways of conversion, including filtration and utilization of hydrogen for transport and combustion / conversion of CO for stationary applications.
Specifically, Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) co-electrolysis towards liquid fuels offers advantages over an electrolysis plus methanation process, in case where hydrocarbon (H/C) fuels are the desired final products. Moreover, co-electrolysis can be fed with recycled CO2 towards the progressive reduction of GHG emissions, where the produced H2 can be used for the synthesis of light-H/Cs as H2 carriers. The commercialization of co-electrolysis will provide a simpler and cost efficient way for the production of light-fuels compared to the mainstream technologies, whereas it is advantageous that the expected technology development can be based on the on the existing status of Solid Oxide Cells.
To commercialize this technology improved component design and system optimisation are required to increase efficiency, as well as a clear understanding of the integration of the technology in the energy system.
Scope:
Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) promise high efficient conversion of renewable electricity into hydrogen and, via hydrogen, into other products. The current state-of-the-art makes use of materials and designs developed for solid oxide fuel cells and improvements in efficiency can be achieved by optimising these materials and designs for SOEC.
The topic therefore asks for:
Novel cell structure and design, including novel electrolyte products and/or new developed electrodes
Design and development of the co-electrolysis process (materials, reactor, operating conditions) towards direct fuel production
Validate the co-electrolysis operation for different targeted outlet H2/CO compositions depending on the synthetic fuel to be produced
Validate its operation with durations over 1,000 hours targeting and defining adapted designs and/or operating conditions to achieve degradation rates below 1% efficiency and 1,000h lifetime
Optionally projects can also:
Develop concepts of co-electrolyser for coupling with downstream catalytic reactors for gas or liquid fuels synthesis
Asses the techno-economic benefits of co-electrolysis for gas or liquid fuel synthesis in comparison to other water electrolysis technologies
Perform a life cycle assessment on the CO2 to prove the recycling potential of this technology
Further there is a need for a techno-economic assessment of the technology. An important problem concerns the variability in prices of CO2 coming from different processes, as well as prices of electricity from different sources, such as nuclear, geothermal, hydroelectricity and wind. Other economic factors should be considered taking into account the whole supply chain, i.e. costs of distribution, transportations, taxations and subsidies.
The proposal has therefore to clearly indicate the system engineering of the complete process in which the co-electrolyser will be considered as well as the strategy of operation, including:
Process for CO2 recovery and reutilization in the co-electrolysis
Integration with the methanation process
Upgrade of the produced synthetic fuel to reach grid specifications
Expected Impact:
Proposals addressing the described technology should carefully justify the current state of the art and the potential evolution of the technology until 2025, to be commercially available and competitive ex-aequo with the conventional syngas production technologies.
The project is finally expected to assess that co-electrolysis may offer a competitive advantage against state-of-the-art technologies for syngas production. The related business case should be part of the project results. The technical performances required to have a profitable business case together with low GHG emission shall be identified.
The proposal is expected to have the following impacts:
Achieve near 50% conversion efficiency from electricity to syngas
prove the concept of co-electrolysis in representative conditions (system scale and power range) as well as identification of real life application areas including the CO2 sources
increase the durability of the co-electrolyser to at least 1,000 hours, from the actual results of lab scale proof of concept systems
decrease the production cost of synthetic gas or liquid fuels with respect to the actual processes. Proposals should present some data on methodology applied and targets proposed
select the most suitable technologies involved in the co-electrolysis process (from CO2 to electricity and fuel production/distribution) and assess the most cost effective route for the production of synthetic fuels."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The specific challenge is stabilization of manufacturing of processes and automation of quality control automation for stationary fuel cells.
In order to achieve cost levels allowing for mass deployment, stationary fuel cells need further significant cost reductions in their manufacturing. The currently still low production volumes do not allow identifying, improving and validating all factors that influence the robustness and yield of the manufacturing processes on cell, stack and system level. Manual quality control steps represent a significant share of the manufacturing cost.
Production processes need to be stabilised already at the level of pilot manufacturing volumes. In particular stack qualification processes need large improvements to reach required yields and performances, and also significant reduction in investment costs for this kind of equipment.
Quality and process control steps and related equipment need to be adapted, automated and implemented. The stabilisation of manufacturing processes, the implementation of in-line quality and process controls on representative pilot production scale needs to reduce the unitary/marginal cost of quality control for cells, stacks and systems to the long-term cost target.
The objective is to implement and validate those improvements in pilot manufacturing in order to establish the trust base for investors to invest in real-scale mass manufacturing plants.
Along with this, fuel cell components need to be optimized to tolerate larger variations of raw materials, allowing for an increased number of suppliers for raw materials. A significant increase in the number of qualified suppliers will strengthen the competitive position of the European fuel cell industry in general.
Scope:  The topic scope includes efforts at process stabilisation in production by process control and improved stack conditioning and qualification, the development of state-of-the-art quality control tools for stack components including cells, interconnects and seals as well as complete stacks.
Means of achieving this can be the transfer of commonly available, touch-less, in-line, fast throughput characterisation methods to fuel cell components manufacturing techniques. Methods include laser and acoustic detection, X-ray screening and others. The development of new, fuel cell specific ad-hoc qualification methods is not included unless they have already reached a TRL of 5 or higher.
All considered methods should reduce the quality control costs at mass manufacturing scale to levels comparable to other similar technologies (e.g. battery). The elaboration of such methods can only be done with components and stacks that are already in pilot production on established lines.
The effectiveness of the quality control process and equipment has to be validated in an established and operating pilot or series manufacturing line for fuel cell stacks or components.
The quality control equipment should be made available for sale on commercial base and a concept for the industrial series manufacturing of the quality control equipment has to be included.
The developed equipment should also enable to monitor closely the tolerance towards variation in raw materials and enable the development of more robust production processes, as well as a broader selection of qualified suppliers.
Expected impact: Break-through cost reduction for quality control steps in the range of one order of magnitude and higher, increased reliability of the produced fuel components and stacks, increased manufacturing capacity by elimination of slow processes already for pilot manufacturing lines.
•             Fast characterisation of cells, stacks and systems through dedicated testing
•             Constant quality in manufacturing: Overall manufacturing process yield > 95%
•             Yield of all single process steps >98%
•             Pilot manufacturing line with constant performance on system level
•             Sufficient robustness against variations in raw material and processing parameters
Enlarged selection of qualified suppliers"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
HT electrolysis has great advantages in terms of thermodynamics and transport phenomena, good possibilities of thermal optimization (through system integration), and so high potential of high value efficiency. Necessarily it has to demonstrate its potential.
HT electrolysis allows reaching much higher efficiencies compared to water electrolysis, which makes this process of prime interest for hydrogen production for different applications (hydrogen production for transportation or other direct industrial usages and renewable energies integration and storage). In this case, materials selection and/or development is necessary.
Considering economic factors, some studies exist with CAPEX and OPEX analysis, leading to a levelized cost of hydrogen for the size of installation considered[1]. For units producing 100 kg of H2 per day, the CAPEX of HT electrolysis is close to the one of PEM water electrolysis, but higher than for alkaline electrolysis. However, thanks to its better efficiency, the levelized cost of hydrogen is below the one of PEM electrolysis whatever the price of electricity, and that it becomes competitive with alkaline electrolysis for an electricity price above 100 €/MWh. These elements highlight the potential of this technology compared to the other electrolysis technologies, and give lots of sense for demonstration project to demonstrate this expected benefit in real environment.
High performances have been validated over the last years (former Relhy and Adel projects) and major improvements have been achieved in terms of durability at stack level, both contributing to an increase of the maturity of the technology. Only few tests have been performed at the system level.
Therefore, there is a strong interest to prove the potential of this technology at the system level and at a scale above 70 kW. A single module or a sum of several modules can realize the target higher power range, to support different market applications with the same technology.
Scope:
Proposals should address:
The design and construction of a HT electrolyser including all balance of plant components for thermal, gas and electrical management, with:
Minimum capacity of 70 kW
Overall electrical efficiency on or above 68% based on higher heating value
Lifetime of at least 2,000 hours.
In-field tests of the HT electrolyser system in a relevant environment for at least 6 months
Assessment of the techno-economic performance of HT electrolysis in comparison to other water electrolysis technologies
Expected Impact:
The proposal is expected to have the following impacts:
Contribution to achieve a target efficiency as indicated in the “Electrolysis Study” from FCH-JU, decreasing electricity consumption to below 40 kWh/kg H2
In-field tests of HT electrolysis under representative conditions and scale as reported in the scope section and validation of the target performances
Identification of business cases where HT electrolysis is more cost competitive than PEM and alkaline electrolysis

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This approach addresses key aspects of interest for the industry related to durability, particularly regarding the stack components as cells, interconnects or seals. Targeting the understanding of realistic failure modes and the development of ASTs that address those failure modes is a valuable contribution in order to shorten the development time of new materials to be integrated in the next system generation. While different ASTs are already available for PEMFC, this topic is much less advanced in SOCs.
Degradation rates currently reported in SOFCs are below 1%/1000h, and they are a bit higher in SOE mode (a few %/1000h). Performing very long tests (several years) are generally not compatible with the availabilities of test stations in laboratories. In addition, the validation of stack components over several years before their integration in a real system is neither compatible with times requested by fuel cell manufacturers for the market deployment of their product.
Therefore, accelerated stress testing is of great benefit. First accelerated testing has been done in SOFC and to a much less extent in SOE, but an extensive work is needed for correlation or transfer function to “Real World” data. As of today, a growing number of FCH 2 JU demonstration projects involving SOFCs are ongoing and expected in Europe, such as for example ENE.FIELD and PACE including SOFC systems, while SOE demonstration projects don’t exist yet but are expected in a near future (such as already in this work-plan). Some projects like ENDURANCE improved the understanding of natural and event-related degradation processes of SOFC materials, thanks to systematic post-mortem investigation that identified critical components for stack lifetime. Multiscale models were set up and refined and specific samples and experimental sessions were designed to statistically validate suggested improvements. A similar coupled experimental/modelling approach has been developed and validated in SOPHIA project, highlighting some phenomena having more extensive effects in SOE.
Finally, some monitoring and diagnostic tools are developed by GENIUS, DESIGN and DIAMOND projects, providing feedback regarding evolution of the performance of the system in correlation with user profile. The availability of quantitative information on stack and its components lifetime as function of system operations, as well as analytical tools to forecast their durability is a valuable asset for further actions towards e.g. optimal maintenance plans.
In order to retrieve most benefits from these past, on-going or starting projects it is important to link these evolutions to materials evolution with quantitative data for various usages.
Scope:
The project should address:
Identification of degradation mechanisms and quantification of degradation on aged stack components (in particular electrodes, interconnects, sealings) coming from existing demonstration projects;
Development of advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques and accelerated stress test (AST) protocols, compatible to existing test station hardware, with the identification of transfer functions of the component degradation measured in an AST to real-world behaviour of that component.
Proposal and validation of AST from materials to stack components and optionally stack level, the latter potentially more application specific when relevant. The developed AST protocols should follow where possible the formats of protocols developed in the SOCTESQA project, in order to be integrated with the EU protocol harmonization undertaken by JRC (see JRC activities);
Development of models related to degradation mechanisms, implementing models describing degradation mechanisms into performance models. Evaluation of the capability of performance/degradation models to confirm and quantify the accelerating impact by adapting some operating or load profiles should be considered. The modelling tools should lead to improved in-operando prognostics and estimation of remaining useful lifetime of the SOC stack in a relevant operational environment;
A key requisite for the project should be the certainty of acquisition of at least 6 aged samples of a given stack component (cell, interconnect, sealant) of at least 3 different stacks (ideally from at least two suppliers) and of the corresponding user profiles.
Projects should focus on a SOC technology (SOFC, SOE, R-SOC). Therefore, the relevant actors should be included in the consortium and/or letters of intent of the materials providers should be provided. Availability of comparable non-aged materials or stack components should be foreseen, to ensure relevant comparison between “real-world” ageing and ageing caused by selected AST.
International collaboration with member countries of the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) is specifically encouraged for this topic.
Laboratories taking part in the proposal should have a record of quality assurance in SOFC/SOEC testing to guarantee reliability and repeatability of the test results.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 3 million per project would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
ASTs will allow faster evaluation of new materials and provide standardized sets of tests to benchmark materials and/or stack components, and will accelerate the development to meet cost (7€/kg H2 produced in 2020 and between 4500 and 7500 €/kW for commercial mid-size SOFCs in 2020) and durability targets (2 years in SOEC and 8-20 years for mid-size stationary SOFCs).
This is based on the following elements:
Enhanced understanding of physical correlation between user profile and degradation mechanisms on at least three stack components (e.g. cell, interconnect, sealing) and its validation with models related to degradation mechanisms;
Define testing methods and evaluation criterion / criteria to allow faster evaluation than current AST of new materials and standardised tests to benchmark materials on the selected stack components with a quantified correlation between AST results and lifetime in a user profile (hydrogen production, CHP), where results should show at least similar ranking between materials or stack components with a good correlation between quantitative degradation features (to be selected such as performances degradation rates, properties losses, microstructure modifications);
Validation of the methodology (i.e. comparison and correlation between “real-world” behaviour and AST caused degradation) should be achieved through a plan for coordination and agreement within the European SOC community, involving the JRC, to confirm the robustness of the AST procedures identified;
Provide recommendations about improvements of monitoring and tracking systems for future deployments in order to capitalise on return of experience;
Final document, including AST test methods, evaluation criteria & validation methodology, with reference to existing global SoA AST, explaining differences and additional valuable information;
Recommendations for international standardisation of Accelerated Stress Testings within IEC TC105 which should where appropriate lead to a New Working Item Proposal (NWIP) or feed into ongoing standardization processes;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Injecting hydrogen admixtures into the natural gas network can contribute significantly to solving the problem of transporting and storing surplus electricity generated from renewable resources. There are, however, a number of challenges to operate safely with hydrogen admixtures (H2NG blends) for the existing gas infrastructure and end use equipment. In order to establish a European understanding of an acceptable hydrogen concentration in the natural gas system, a number of knowledge gaps need to be filled. The addition of hydrogen to natural gas influences gas properties and therefore the performance and safe operation of existing applications (including industrial gas turbines, industrial burners and residential burners). Domestic and commercial users are generally “passive” users of their gas appliances and they are not able themselves to intervene with the appliance (e.g. to counterbalance the effect of a gas change). Conversely, industrial users have more possibilities to intervene and retrofit/develop integrated mitigation solutions. Therefore, domestic and commercial users need to be addressed differently from industrial ones and this topic focuses exclusively on domestic and commercial applications.
Power-to-gas systems injecting admixtures of 2 vol% have been widely demonstrated, further demonstrations of up to 20 vol% (e.g. GRHYD, HyDeploy) are underway and have already shown that such systems can operate to provide grid services and absorb surplus renewables: already 10 vol% is permissible in some parts of the natural gas system, while a 2 vol% limit must be applied close to CNG refuelling stations. There is however a need to define a clear vision at EU level of the admissible hydrogen percentage for use in domestic and commercial applications. In addition, there is a need to identify the RCS needs for progressively enhancing the admissible hydrogen concentration in the gas system. CEN/TC 238, which is in charge of test gases for gas appliances and of defining gas appliance categories, has expressed the need for this PreNormative Research, PNR in view of the revision of EN 437 (the key transverse standard used for the testing required for the regulatory certification of gas appliances).
Scope:
Research is required to identify and verify the impacts of continuous and time-varying supplies of H2NG blends on the combustion characteristics (flame speed and shape, temperature, emissivity, emissions) of appliances together with the potential impacts on appliance safety, efficiency, lifetime and environmental performance (e.g. NOx emissions). Results from previous and ongoing national and EU projects should be included (e.g. NaturalHy, GASQUAL, HIPS-NET, DOMHYDRO, GRHYD, HyDeploy, etc.) and their transferability evaluated.
Low, medium and high hydrogen concentrations in natural gas should be investigated:
Low = <10% Vol.
Medium = 10-30% Vol.
High = 30-60% Vol.
The following activities should be undertaken, by means of desk research supported by an integrated experimental programme, and consider a wide range of appliances and hydrogen concentrations:
Evaluate the existing end-use stock and new appliances with respect to their sensitivity to hydrogen concentration. Existing knowledge should be collated, testing procedures defined and testing undertaken both in relation to the existing EU stock of installed (domestic and commercial) appliances and to new gas technologies (e.g. micro-cogeneration, gas heat pumps, space heaters, fuel cells). The experimental procedures should be chosen to represent as far as possible real operative conditions (e.g. full components should be preferred to downsized laboratory prototypes). Validated accelerated stress testing should be performed, considering gas quality fluctuations and changes in environmental conditions. In some cases, in order to reduce testing costs, testing at the highest hydrogen concentration values may be ignored provided that a reasonable assessment can be made by modelling;
Evaluate mitigation solutions to widen the acceptance of appliances to higher hydrogen concentrations. Existing combustion controls designed for natural gas quality variation are not necessarily suited for working with H2NG blends, so mitigation solutions should be determined and their technical feasibility verified. The work involving testing and/or modelling should cover hardware (combustions controls) for new or existing appliances (retrofit) and if relevant on site adjustment procedures. Burner modifications and other design changes should be identified, including possible simple actions to remedy any problems preventing the adoption of higher hydrogen concentrations. Tests should cover the main segment of the domestic and commercial appliance market and give priority to appliances that have been shown to be sensitive to hydrogen concentration and include long term testing. Where possible, appliance manufacturers should be involved;
Identify new test methods /test gases for the certification of domestic and commercial appliances (falling under the Gas Appliances Regulation). In the future, gas burning appliances will have to be tested with H2NG specific test procedures and test gases to enable their certification, a prerequisite for the use of H2NG blends.
The tests should cover the impact on safety, efficiency, reliability, lifetime (for small domestic appliances only), CO, NOx and other possible impacts.
The combustion parameters Wobbe index, methane number, laminar flame speed and flame temperature are among the main parameters that should be considered in the investigation. Testing should be performed with different compositions of natural gas combined with different hydrogen concentrations. Temporal fluctuations in the concentration of hydrogen should also be studied. Gas of lower calorific value (L gas) is not considered in scope (due to its declining use).
It is expected that the consortium will interact with manufacturers, gas consumers and gas industry .
It is expected that the project will contribute towards the objectives and activities of the Hydrogen Innovation Challenge (as detailed under section 3.2.G. International cooperation). Promoting international collaboration beyond EU Member States and H2020 Associated Countries is therefore strongly encouraged.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2.5 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
The project will ensure that the safe operation of existing and future gas appliances and applications is not jeopardized by the supply of H2NG instead of the natural gas composition range for which they have been designed and certified, and identify categories of existing appliances and equipment that would need to be replaced as the hydrogen concentration is increased. The expected impacts of the project include:
Establishing what concentration hydrogen admixture can be implemented in the domestic and commercial sector without changing the existing certification of appliances;
Establishing how the existing certification shall be modified to allow higher concentrations, including the related additional costs and the required changes to common gas burners;
Recommendations for revision of EN or ISO standards or drafting of new standards based on PNR results and a review of the existing testing methods;
Improved knowledge on the effect of H2NG on common burner types including necessary adjustments and design changes. This will help the industry to bring on the market appliances that will accept H2NG.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The development of a widely available hydrogen vehicle refuelling infrastructure across EU will need hydrogen to be able to be dispensed in a straight-forward manner alongside other conventional and alternative fuels. Whilst the Directive 2014/94/EU on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (AFID) [75] introduces interoperability requirements for individual alternative fuels, and, in the future, requirements on the number of distances between refuelling/recharging points, it will not necessarily enable this infrastructure to be provided in a multi-fuel/multi-energy forecourt.
Currently the approach taken to co-location of hydrogen and other fuels is left to be defined on a national basis. This can have a variation of effects: in some cases is straight-forward to co-locate hydrogen with other fuels and integrate hydrogen into a conventional forecourt, in others the provision of hydrogen can be subject to not insignificant minimum separation distances from other fuels, with a hydrogen dispenser needing to be either on an ‘island’ on its own or located away from the forecourt (or even not be permitted at all).
The definition of safety recommendations for including hydrogen in a multi-fuel configuration requires zoning and risk assessment. Furthermore, the different approaches to zoning taken around EU can make it difficult for a standard dispenser product to be designed/manufactured/installed without significant additional justification, or alterations to the design (even though the dispensers typically use components that barely differ). One key missing element to enable standardised zoning and risk assessment is the characterization of the leaks that can be anticipated from hydrogen dispensing technologies and their effects (fire, explosion).
To address this gap, experimental data from engineering research on H2 leaks for HRS is necessary, including analysis of their effects and the reliability of the safety barriers typically employed in hydrogen dispenser design and installation.
[75] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32014L0094
Scope:
The main aim of this topic is to provide guidance to assist the deployment of gaseous hydrogen dispensing in a multi-fuel environment across EU, overcoming the technical and administrative barriers consistently by using a clear, transparent and scientifically sound methodology. The work should therefore tackle at least the following objectives:
1. Detailed investigation of current status:
A comprehensive review of existing (i) permitting requirements (and where applicable public guidance) and (ii) risk assessment (including, for example hazardous areas and safety distances) methodologies used across EU for hydrogen in multi-fuel refuelling stations. This should also include and complete safety requirements established already by FCH 2 JU projects [76] such as HyLaw, H2ME, HyFive etc. and from other relevant stakeholders groupings, such as the Sector Forum Gas Infrastructure WG Mobility (SFGI WG Mobility) [77]. The project should therefore go beyond these activities and perform more detailed investigations into the approaches taken for hydrogen dispensers in different EU countries, for both light duty and heavy-duty road vehicles.
The full scope of requirements should be covered, including zoning, risk assessment with accidental scenarios and leak sizes, and the relevant parts of permitting. The project should identify and critically assess relevant documentation (e.g. safety studies) which have contributed to the installation of HRS or development of normative rules. This should include investigating whether or not there is a route to a common approach that can be justified to regulators and other relevant authorizing parties across EU, in order to simplify the installation of hydrogen dispensers, particularly in cases where these are co-located with other fuels and often subject to authorization processes that differ from stand-alone stations.
2. Practical research to address gaps in current understanding:
The principal scope of the experimental campaign should be the hydrogen dispensing system. Taking into consideration the identified approaches for risk assessment, the project should perform an experimental research campaign for the characterization of potential hydrogen leaks that contribute to risk assessment for a hydrogen dispensing system (leak sizes, likelihood, suitability of control measures etc.). The project should undertake a theoretical and experimental research focused on the characterization of hydrogen leaks with their potential (leak size, likelihood and leak rate) and their effects (explosion, fire). Generic types of equipment (non-standardised and if available, standardised fuelling components/systems) used in dispenser systems should be considered. A wide practical testing campaign shall be performed on such components to determine and justify hole size assumptions used in hazardous area or separation distance calculations. The first step includes tests on critical HRS equipment in order to determine the frequency of leak and the size of the leak with test cycles. In the same philosophy, the critical safety barriers could be tested in order to determine their reliability. The second step should include a quantification of the scenarios generated by these leaks: probability of the event (with the previous data) and the effects (with dispersion study by computational tools). The consequences of expected usage scenarios, for example, temperature and pressure cycles, aging, improper use, impacts for leaks of other fuels, etc. should be considered within this research.
3. Generate best practice guidance:
Using the findings from the points above, develop best practice guidelines that can be utilised as common approach to risk assessments (e.g. related to zoning, separation distances etc.) addressing the permitting requirements as well as safe designs for hydrogen refuelling stations in a multi-fuel context. The effect of proximity to the other components of the refuelling station (e.g. storage tanks, compressors, etc.) should also be considered in this part.
This guidance should be prepared in a manner that can be applied throughout EU to help the development of national guidance/requirements where applicable and in a consistent manner. It should support the development of common assumptions for hazardous area classification for hydrogen dispensers across EU. The data collected should enable the development of the minimum requirements in standards (and regulations and codes if appropriate) such that they offer an improved reliability to those currently used, and an appropriate level of safety for customers using the stations without excessive costs or other issues relating to unnecessarily conservative estimates. Guidance documents should be developed for performing example zoning/risk assessments for both (a) hydrogen-only dispenser and (b) the additional hazards from collocating hydrogen equipment with other fuel dispensing equipment in a multi-fuel context.
4. Engagement with permitting authorities and standards developing organisations (SDOs):
The consortium should build a network of public authorities and use existing networks or forums, such as HySafe [78] to foster engagement, knowledge and experience sharing. By engaging with a network of public authorities, the consortium should share the relevant materials developed within the project to support the drafting of guidelines for HRS developers.
Finally, it should foster exchanges of best practices with Mission Innovation IC-8 (and IPHE countries). All Member States and EEA countries should, at least be invited to join a network of public authorities. SDOs should also be engaged to foster better uptake of the project results.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected Impact:
The project should produce:
(i) A compilation of permitting requirements and best practices for risk assessment methodologies currently used for HRS across EU and a list of PNR gaps identified in previous relevant projects;
(ii) Experimental and theoretical data supporting the knowledge gaps associated to risk assessment for hydrogen dispensers in a multi-fuel environment, reported publicly in manner that supports regulatory compliance and regulatory development;
(iii) Best practice guidance on what constitutes safe designs for hydrogen refuelling stations in multi-fuel contexts, based on scientifically derived, clear, consensus driven guidance, that can be published for instance through CEN/CENELEC [79], or other routes as appropriate, backed up by the results of the experimental and theoretical research performed within the project;
(iv) A network of public authorities which has contributed to all stages of implementation of the project and which serve as the target group for the results experimental and analytical data.
The results of the project should enable public authorities across EU to develop rules based on scientific evidence and common, agreed assumptions for hazardous area classification for hydrogen dispensers. It will vastly simplify the process of designing and permitting standardised hydrogen dispensers which will lead to greater degree of harmonisation of requirements for the permitting of hydrogen dispensing alongside other fuels, thus (i) reducing cost and (ii) ensuring that hydrogen dispensing can be co-located with other fuels safely.
The inclusion and involvement of a network of national authorities is essential for ensuring take-up of results and maximising the impact of the project.
The elimination of legal and regulatory barriers will reduce costs (financial, human resources and actual time) for economic operators and public authorities and speed up the large-scale commercial deployment of key hydrogen applications in numbers that will allow them to have a meaningful contribution to the European Union’s energy, environmental and climate policy goals.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Legal-administrative barriers are among the obstacles currently impeding a quicker deployment of fuel cell and hydrogen (FCH) technologies. These barriers, which often reflect a lack of awareness and/or acknowledgement of the key features of FCH technologies within national legal codes and local planning by-laws, along with additional bureaucracy and complex sets of procedures and requirements, can significantly hamper FCH installation and operational processes.
Promoters of projects and activities using FCH technologies are obliged to allocate substantive time and effort on overcoming legal-administrative barriers related to:
Planning and installation / operations processes for FCH technologies (i.e. notification, registration, licensing, safety and environmental impact assessment, etc.)
Electricity grid connections (for consumption, storage or injection of electricity derived from FCH installations)
Gas grid connections (either for consuming natural gas for FCH power output or for injecting hydrogen into natural gas networks for load balancing and subsequent energy abstraction)
Certification, registration, use and parking/storage of fuel cell electrical vehicles (FCEVs)
Fuel definition – particularly related to H2 as a transport fuel and for the dispensing of H2 at Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS) or use of H2 in other transport related or stationary applications
Compliance is complex and time consuming and the information on the applicable procedures is difficult to identify for businesses wishing to install, operate and use FCH systems locally, nationally and internationally. In some cases rules are inexistent or uncertain as it is not clear whether rules or procedures developed for other gases and technologies will be applied to hydrogen and fuel cells by the authorities. Regulators and administrative authorities themselves have limited information about procedures and practices applied in other countries.
As a result, the development and the sustainable establishment of markets for applications using fuel cells and hydrogen technology in many European countries is unnecessarily delayed.
Scope:
There are two key objectives under the scope of the project and these should relate to barriers where a region or a Member State has a direct mandate to address the identified barrier(s). The first objective is to provide a comprehensive set applicable requirements and procedures for FCH technology installation and operation – and to make the information readily accessible and available to both those who set / regulate the requirements, processes and procedures and those wishing to install and operate the FCH technologies. It also requires measuring their impact in terms of delay and costs. Further, it is necessary to facilitate the comparison of the requirements and procedures applied in the different states and regions of Europe.
The second objective is to reduce the time and costs for compliance by preparing recommendations aiming at simplification of the requirements and procedures or facilitation of compliance.
To achieve both objectives, the action should be organised around three successive steps:
Research and analyse administrative processes in European countries by means of both desk research and interactive industry surveys.
Formulation of concrete recommendations, whether based on observed ‘best practices’ or new procedures, to be prepared in the format of an advisory paper for each country (or region). The recommendations should be publicly discussed, in particular with industry stakeholders and public authorities before being finalised
Promotion of recommendations and improvement of the administrative framework: policy papers should be presented to relevant public authorities, utilities and other involved bodies at the national, regional and EU level. Dissemination workshops should also be organised.
In terms of geographical scope, it may not be possible to cover all EU countries and associated countries, the action should cover at least 12 of these countries and focus on those countries with largest capacity and potential for RES, linked to green and waste hydrogen production and use, providing best opportunities for deployment of FCH technologies. In countries where regions play an important role in defining administrative requirements and procedures applicable to FCH technologies, the analysis and the recommendation should include the regional level.
The consortium should include a strategy to ensure the continuity of the activities after the end of the FCH JU funded action. This strategy should ensure that the database continue to be available and be updated after the end of the action. It should also ensure that the policy papers and the associated recommendation continue to be promoted.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.0 million allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Duration: 2 years.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
An online and publicly available database of legal and administrative processes in main EU countries with a focus on those countries where the deployment of FCH technologies are the most advanced .and, to the extent possible, on all 12 selected EU and associated countries. The database should also enable the comparison of the different administrative frameworks and their implication in terms of costs and delays. Reference example databases include http://www.pvgrid.eu/database.html; http://www.pvlegal.eu/; and http://www.pvgrid.eu
Policy papers country by country in English and the relevant national language describing the administrative barriers and their effect in terms of delay and cost as well as recommendation for removing/reducing these barriers

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Compressed gas truck distribution will initially be the most common way to transport hydrogen from central production sites to consuming facilities. Significant introduction of hydrogen vehicles requires a scale up of two orders of magnitude hydrogen truck distribution. At the same time developing and deploying a high volume trailer is necessary to address both the H2 Mobility market but also the industrial market to increase the volume transported so as to decrease transportation cost and CO2 emissions in a context of increasing fuel cost; to increase customer autonomy and storage footprint and to reduce the HRS investments and ease the ramp up of first stations [1].
Current standards, regulations and safety codes have been developed for a relatively small market volume and deliveries mostly to industrial sites. These standards need to be reviewed, and adapted if needed, to ensure safe, efficient and low-cost hydrogen delivery at larger scales and in residential areas. These regulations and standards need to be harmonised across Europe.
[1] From DeliverHy – Recommendations to Industry (http://www.fch.europa.eu/project/optimisation-transport-solutions-compressed-hydrogen)
Scope:
The following specific issues should be addressed by the project:
Identify and quantify the risks associated with compressed hydrogen delivery on a large scale, taking into account the whole chain from filling of trucks at a terminal, driving from supplier to customer and delivery of hydrogen at a retail station or other customers;
Propose mitigation actions for the most critical risks;
Provide a roadmap for standardisation of compressed hydrogen trucks and interfaces between the truck and the supply and customer sites that balance safety aspects with commercial, environmental and feasibility aspects. This includes a strategy for effective influence on:
ISO TC 58/SC3 Gas Cylinders Design;
WG 35 Refillable permanently mounted composite tubes for transportation: ISO 17519 CD;

Develop a position paper that, considering actually available European Regulations on max pressure and max quantity of hydrogen transported all over Europe, can propose a modification and derogation proposal to the ARD [2].
To address the issues basic experimentation or simulations may be required, for example to determine optimal flow rates and to optimise ways of equipment handling.
It is expected that the conclusions and results of the project are made public.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Injecting hydrogen admixtures into the natural gas network can contribute significantly to solving the problem of transporting and storing surplus electricity generated from renewable resources (see e.g. working document on Energy storage – the role of electricity SWD(2017) 61). There are, however, a number of challenges for the existing gas grid infrastructure and end use equipment to operate safely with the admixture of hydrogen (H2NG). In order to establish a European understanding of an acceptable hydrogen concentration in the natural gas system, a number of knowledge gaps need to be filled. Depending on the hydrogen concentration, among other parameters, different components of the gas system or end-user appliances and processes may be affected. Generally, the addition of hydrogen to natural gas influences gas properties and therefore operational aspects, functionality of devices and appliances, degradation of materials and infrastructure requirements (safety and functionality). The performance and safe operation of existing industrial turbines, industrial burners and residential burners have been identified as critical issues that need to be addressed on short term to enable the further uptake of hydrogen in the natural gas grid (e.g. see the Final Report of the CEN - CENELEC Sector Forum Energy Management/Working Group Hydrogen). For turbines and burners, the actual impact of a continuous and likely varying supply of H2NG on the combustion is to be verified with the potential impacts on the safety of appliances and applications and the impacts on efficiency, lifetime and environmental performance (e.g. NOx emissions). Results from previous and ongoing national and EU projects should be considered (e.g. NaturalHy, GASQUAL, HIPS, DOMHYDRO, GRHYD, HyDeploy, etc.).
Power-to-gas systems injecting admixtures of 2% have been widely demonstrated, further demonstrations of up to 20% (e.g. GRHYD, HyDeploy) are underway and it has been shown that such systems can operate to provide grid services and absorb surplus renewables. However, the economic factors in progressing from natural gas to H2NG blends within the gas grid have yet to be established. An exhaustive techno-economic evaluation of admixture of hydrogen into the natural gas grid adapted to the local, regional or national situation should therefore be undertaken, with a particular focus on policy options. Such an evaluation should identify all relevant cost drivers, benefits and risks, considering both technical and financial aspects. Cost efficient strategies for adapting the infrastructure can then be developed and a roadmap for the injection of hydrogen prepared to support a macro-economically feasible transformation path towards higher limits for allowable hydrogen concentrations in the gas system.
Scope:
The scope of this topic encompasses a techno-economic assessment in addition to pre-normative research activities. There are two main activities to be carried out:
1. Pre-normative research on critical issues related to end-use applications and equipment.
The core of the topic is the evaluation of the actual impact of H2NG mixtures on the combustion process (flame speed, shape, temperature, emissivity, emissions) of end-use applications, and equipment: their safety, efficiency and lifetime across a wide range of hydrogen concentrations. Whereas hydrogen concentrations around 20 vol% can be considered a long term goal, already now 10 vol% of hydrogen are feasible in some parts of the natural gas system. Close to CNG stations, 2 vol% hydrogen is today a limiting factor due to the use of steel tanks for CNG vehicles. The hydrogen concentrations used for testing should be chosen accordingly.
An assessment should be performed aiming at the selection and clustering of end-use applications. An in depth assessment and analysis of previously carried out research shall be undertaken, including an analysis on the transferability of results. This analysis should be used to guide the selection of applications. The selection of critical end-use applications to be further investigated shall be done according to the following criteria and dimensions:
Prioritisation of critical end-use applications in terms of sensitivity and resistivity to H2NG. Giving a fair balance between the sensitivity of the segment to H2NG and the market share among applications;
For a number of low, medium and high hydrogen concentrations, identify if and what adjustments and design changes are required for
(i) gas burners as used in common domestic/commercial/light industrial/industrial equipment (i.e. boilers, cookers, gas heaters, ovens, dryers, furnaces etc.) and
(ii) gas heat engines (reciprocating engines and gas turbines);
Integrating the new gas technologies (e.g. micro-cogeneration, gas heat pumps, fuel cells) that will play an increasing role in the future;
Pre-normative research on end-use appliances and equipment, including control devices, should be performed based on this selection and prioritisation work, aiming at assessing compatibility, performance and lifetime of end-users applications (or their critical components such as burners, engines), under conditions not yet covered by other studies. It should be ensured that already installed gas appliances and equipment can continue to function safely and with a satisfactory level of efficiency and environmental performance when supplied with H2NG instead of natural gas for low, medium and high hydrogen concentrations.
Appliances certification aspects (including re-certification needs) should be considered. To investigate combustion behaviour and its influence on the mentioned criteria of material compatibility, performance and lifetime, the experimental campaign should be chosen representing as far as possible real operative conditions, and full components should be preferred (as far as possible) to downsize laboratory samples. This pre-normative research can include the development of testing methods and procedures.
The project should develop a suitable detailed experimental program, which should be derived from agreed priorities at European level. Appliances compliant with the Gas Appliance Directive, both domestic and non-domestic, will be evaluated. Common burner types used for large commercial and industrial boilers as used in ovens, dryers, furnaces etc. should also be investigated. Common types of gas engines should be considered.
The combustion parameters Wobbe index, methane number and laminar flame speed should be considered. Different compositions of H2 gas should be taken into account. Fluctuations in the concentration of hydrogen will have to be considered as well.
Tests should be carried out for boilers, cookers, water heaters, space heaters, μCHPs, gas heat pumps, fuel cells and gas engines following an appropriate testing protocol. The tests should include an evaluation of the sensitivity of the application to hydrogen and consider the impact on safety, efficiency, reliability, lifetime, CO, NOx and other possible impacts.
Test gases used for the certification of gas appliances by notified bodies (as required by the Gas Appliance Directive), include for the gas group most widely used in Europe test gas G222 consisting of 77 % CH4 and 23 % H2. It is however used only for tests of a short duration. Longer-term testing, also with higher H2 concentrations should be carried out. Tests should assess the potential long-term effects of hydrogen. Validated accelerated stress testing should be performed, considering gas quality fluctuations and changes in environmental conditions.
The impact of H2 content on NOx levels, for which European legislation sets lower limits than previously should be verified.
For gas engines specifically, the effect of hydrogen on knock and pre-ignition should be investigated, as well as on the control systems.

2. Techno-economic assessment including analysis of policy options to enable the wide adoption of H2NG blends.
A techno-economic analysis, identifying plausible remuneration frameworks and policy options needs to be undertaken to ensure that the respective stakeholders (i.e. renewable power generators, electricity grid operators, gas network and storage operators as well as H2NG customers) can realise the benefits of adopting H2NG blends. There are several policy options to consider (including government imposed targets for the decarbonisation of gas grids, a higher carbon tax on natural gas for funding the implementation of H2NG, a voluntary Guarantee of Origin scheme for the gas industry, the removal of taxes and levies on electricity used by power-to-gas systems and feed-in-tariffs for various concentrations of H2NG).
Further analysis should then be undertaken to consider cost drivers and policy options for enabling a progression in the concentration level, as a function of the findings of the first challenge related to end-use appliances and equipment. The assessment of the regulatory hurdles that prevent the increased uptake of hydrogen in the natural gas grid and its use by end-user applications will have to be mapped, considering individual EU Member States' limitations. A pre-requisite for the work to be performed is an overview of the materials, components and equipment actually present in the gas chain at European level. The entire gas chain including all end-users of natural gas should be considered. Based on the outcome of the assessment, cost efficient strategies for adopting H2NG blends, ownership and operating models for injecting H2NG blends and policy suggestions should be prepared to support a macro-economically feasible transformation path from low to high hydrogen concentrations in the gas system.
It is expected that proposal will include appliance and burner manufacturers, power-to-gas technology providers, gas consumers and gas industry.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
International collaboration with member countries of the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) is specifically encouraged for this topic.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2.75 million per project would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
The proposed techno-economic assessment and pre-normative research will enable an easier and wider development of injection of hydrogen admixtures into natural gas networks, supporting deployment of hydrogen technologies and contributing to decarbonisation of the European energy system and to European energy security goals. This will be achieved by comprehensive knowledge of cost drivers and policy options at European level. The project will ensure that the safe operation of existing and future gas appliances and applications is not jeopardised by the supply of H2NG instead of the natural gas composition range for which they have been designed and certified for; and identify categories of existing appliances and equipment that would need to be replaced as the hydrogen concentration is increased.
The expected impacts of the project include:
Establishing how much hydrogen can be added to natural gas without changing the existing certification of appliances. Establishing how the existing certification can be adapted to possibly allow higher concentration of hydrogen, including the related additional costs, and the required changes to common gas burners to combust such mixtures;
Improved knowledge on effect of H2NG on common burner types used for large commercial and industrial boilers as used in ovens, dryers, furnaces, including necessary adjustments and design changes;
Recommendations for revision of EN or ISO standards or drafting of new standards based on PNR results and review of the existing testing methods;
Mapping of EU member state regulations limiting the hydrogen concentration in the gas system and identification of critical regulatory bottlenecks including proposal to address those;
Identification of policy options, remuneration frameworks and operational models for enabling the wide adoption of hydrogen admixtures in European gas networks.
Developing an EU level roadmap for the increase of hydrogen concentration in natural gas up to 2030;
The efforts related to the experimental part of the pre-normative research on end-use applications are estimated to be about 70% of the total budget.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The lack of standardised fuelling protocols that can be used for any medium or heavy-duty vehicle is a significant barrier preventing larger hydrogen fuel cell vehicles from progressing past the back-to-base philosophy and is a major hurdle for both infrastructure players and vehicle manufacturers to develop and deploy standard products. With an increasing number of zero emission buses and trucks expected to be deployed in EU, a validated refuelling protocol (or set of protocols) for vehicles with Compressed Hydrogen Storage System (CHSS) of capacities >250 litres, or >10 kg storage, is needed. This is a prerequisite for meeting the increasing end-user demand for a) hydrogen fuel and b) short refuelling times; it is the key to opening the commercial market for such vehicles and ensuring HRS are able to safely refuel them.
Furthermore, industry consensus needs to be achieved around the storage technology to be used for capacities of >50 kg on-board a vehicle, because long haul heavy-duty vehicles will most likely not be able to make use of 350 bar CHSS (as currently used by municipal vehicles and city buses) due to the large volumes of hydrogen required.
Currently the majority of HRS for compressed hydrogen serve only “light duty” vehicles, i.e. those with CHSS capacities <250 litres. These typically use the SAE J2601 standards for fuelling protocols, or alternatively fuelling protocols based on these, such as the Clean Energy Partnership (CEP) protocol(s). These are typically unsuitable for the CHSS capacities used for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, and often the dispensers are also physically inaccessible to larger vehicles.
SAE J2601-2:2014 includes some information for fuelling vehicles with >10kg of storage and provides boundary conditions for safe refuelling, but it leaves much of the fuelling protocol up to the reader. Whilst this is reasonable for return-to-base applications for fleet vehicles (e.g. buses) known to the refuelling station operator, it is not appropriate for the wider application of vehicles that would require >250 litre storage using different stations, as the current SAE J2601-2 lacks the practical level of detail required for a full standard.
In general, the technical challenge can be grouped into : (a) vehicles with a storage capacity of up to approx. 50 kg hydrogen, some of which are already in existence, and (b) vehicles requiring capacities of over 50 kg hydrogen, which are under development. There is currently no agreed solution available for both of these groups. Whilst the dispenser and refuelling station for different transport sectors may differ, a fuelling protocol for road vehicles, or trains, or boats, with the same capacity of CHSS should be able to utilise a similar fuelling protocol.
Scope:
There are two overarching objectives to be addressed by this topic:
1. Fuelling protocol(s) should be developed to enable the short-term uptake of hydrogen vehicles based on modelling, experimental validation and field tests. These should be able to be used to fill any compressed hydrogen vehicle of >250 litre CHSS capacity, rather than be protocols specific to particular vehicles (for instance captive fleets of a certain vehicle design). Such vehicles include, but are not limited to vans, buses, trucks, coaches, lorries, trains, ferries, boats and other appropriate mobile hydrogen fuelled applications. This should preferably include fuelling to Nominal Working Pressures (NWP) of both 350 bar and 700 bar, but this does not preclude considering other possible NWPs (e.g. 500 bar).
It is possible that one fuelling protocol would not cater effectively for all sizes of CHSS >250 litres, so it is expected that a small number of protocols, relevant to identified CHSS capacities, could be required (for instance from 250 litres to 500 litres, and 500 litres to 1000 litres), if it is not feasible to use a single protocol. If so, appropriate break points for the size of CHSS capacities should be identified for vehicles that would typically use a Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) specific refuelling station.
The protocol(s) should cater for fuelling in a wide of range of ambient conditions (e.g. from -40 °C to +50 °C). It should prevent over pressurisation or overheating of the CHSS above 125% NWP, and above +85 °C, to match the capabilities of the on-board storage vessels currently available. This short-term protocol(s) could use 120 g/s as a maximum hydrogen flow rate to avoid inconsistency with current standards, although it would be considered advantageous to explore higher flow rates.
This work should be carried out in conjunction with SAE J2601-2 and other relevant standards organisations (for example ISO TC 197). Where possible, it should further develop and make available publically the protocols developed in previous hydrogen bus projects (e.g. HyFleet-CUTE) or other applicable work (e.g. HyTransfer).
2. A feasibility study should be undertaken into the needs of future protocols, which should include storage technologies for capacities over 50 kg hydrogen. Whilst “light duty” gaseous hydrogen vehicle fuelling protocols are limited to 60 g/s, and currently some “heavy duty” gaseous hydrogen vehicle fuelling protocols are limited to 120 g/s, there is an anticipated need for greater refuelling rates for vehicles with large CHSS capacities.
The suitability of the current maximum limit of 120 g/s proposed in SAE J2601-2 should be investigated, to identify what components limit the refuelling rate, including but not limited to, the nozzle, receptacle, on-board storage vessel(s) and associated valve(s). Design options for enabling larger flow rates to be used should be identified.
A thorough technology review and benchmarking should be performed for both gaseous and liquefied hydrogen dispensing, keeping practicability and technical constraints in mind to identify the most suitable storage technology for applications such as long haul trucks, coaches, trains, sea-going ships, inland barges, hydrogen transport systems, mobile gensets, etc. Careful consideration is needed to ensure acceptability for all vehicle and systems manufacturers as well as HRS equipment manufacturers and infrastructure operators. Whilst not part of the scope of this work, it should be borne in mind that the technology will then need to be able to be standardized with globally defined boundary conditions that do not pose a restriction to safety of operation, speed of fill and suitability for purpose.
This part of the project should also look into appropriate boundary conditions for the fuelling, and make recommendations on whether different conditions to those currently used for vehicles (in SAE J2601, EN 17127 or ISO 19880-1 for example) can be reassessed to enable faster fuelling.
A workshop(s) might be held at the start of the project to, where possible, identify the current approaches being taken or being anticipated for the fuelling vehicles with >250 litre storage.
The outcome of both objectives should be disseminated to the hydrogen mobility and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure sectors in workshop(s) at the end of the project. Findings and recommendations should also be disseminated to the SAE FCEV Interface Taskforce, and ISO TC 197 WG24 as a minimum, and other standardization committees in the field of hydrogen fuelled heavy goods vehicles, boats and trains.
The consortium should comprise partners from the following sectors: HRS suppliers / HRS operators, medium / heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers (not limited to road vehicles) and component suppliers (e.g. tank, nozzle/receptacle) as appropriate, and organisations able to model fuelling events, in order to scope and validate the practical testing. In addition, the participation of Notified Bodies / hydrogen refuelling station authorisers is also recommended.
A suitable medium and heavy duty hydrogen vehicle refuelling station(s) should be made available for this work by one or more of the project partners and should be evidenced at a proposal stage – either existing, or expected to exist before the project starts. Building of a new hydrogen station is not an eligible cost, while the costs toward fitting an existing station with the necessary hardware, for instance to enable precooling of the hydrogen dispensed, to enable a light duty fuelling station with flow limitations of 60 g/s to deliver up to 120 g/s, or, if applicable, to permit fuelling at 500 bar etc. Are considered eligible. A sufficiently instrumented and controllable dispensing system is required, that is capable of dispensing hydrogen at a range of appropriate flow rates, temperatures and pressures for vehicles with various on-board storage capacities.
Links with other relevant FCH 2 JU funded projects should be established, in particular with the trucks or maritime projects when considering where the future for on-board storage solutions for these applications may lie.
It is expected that the project will contribute towards the objectives and activities of the Hydrogen Innovation Challenge (as detailed under section 3.2.G. International cooperation). Promoting international collaboration beyond EU Member States and H2020 Associated Countries is therefore strongly encouraged.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 2 years.
Expected Impact:
A proven protocol or series of protocols, suitable for any hydrogen vehicle with a larger quantity of on-board storage than those of typical light duty vehicles should be developed as part of this project, with the aim of preparing this protocol(s) for acceptance into relevant international standards.
Consensus on the storage technology and specification to be used for large quantities of hydrogen, which will enable the development of refuelling infrastructure and allow free movement of hydrogen powered medium and heavy-duty vehicles, which would otherwise be limited to prohibitively short ranges if required to fill from the same dispensers as light duty vehicles. A feasibility study into, and development of industry consensus on, storage methods, dispensing protocols and the infrastructure-vehicle-interface (e.g. an ultra-high flow nozzle, capable of approx. 500 g/s) will lay the ‘ground stone’ for the development in the heavy duty long haul area, where significantly greater than 50 kg storage can be expected to be needed.
Key benefits of suitable fuelling protocols that the project delivers include:
Shorter refuelling times for end-users, resulting in more competitive products (product attractiveness);
Non-proprietary protocols over proprietary protocols opens up the EU market for HRS developers and influences the world market heavy-duty segment (competitive markets);
Competence development for protocols for important early markets (EU leadership);
One common approach to fuelling of large storage systems for different applications (e.g. long-haul trucks, coaches, trains, inland barges, transport systems, etc.) also offers the possibility to create a large enough market for component manufacturers to be able to develop and offer components at attractive prices, something the industry is currently struggling with.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In April 2018, the International Maritime Organisation, IMO adopted an initial strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships (overall fleet target ≥50% CO2 reduction by 2050 compared to 2008) [80]. Alternative fuels and FC technologies can help meet these environmental and climate goals but require short and medium-term measures to become sustainable, viable and safe solutions. H2 and FC technologies are not covered nor supported by existing regulations applicable to the maritime sector, undermining the willingness of actors (in particular ship-builders and owners) to invest and develop solutions based on these technologies.
The current IMO International Code of Safety for Ship Using Gases or Other Low-flashpoint Fuels, IGF Code [81] covers primarily LNG. It is nevertheless of outmost importance for the shipbuilding industry to have provisions for the introduction of other low-flashpoint fuels used by fuel cell power generation systems. Although the IGF Code itself provides general indications for a goal-oriented approach on such installations to introduce novel technologies, designers and operators can only rely upon a performance-based technology qualification process, supplemented by complex safety assessment methodologies.
Since a regulatory framework applicable to hydrogen fuelled ships is not yet available, the only approach is given by IMO generic ‘Alternative Design’ process whereby safety, reliability and dependability of the systems is to be proven equivalent to that of traditional fuels and power generation systems. Extensive formal safety assessment methodologies should be carried out and national flag administrations require specific and agreed regulatory framework to approve such installations.
To draft a dedicated chapter in the IGF Code, IMO member states would need to gather theoretical guidance, feedback from existing applications, best practices, reference from other industrial sectors, available technologies, safety procedures in design and operation, human element aspects, etc. This would smooth and speed up the development of a comprehensive set of international regulation.

Scope:
The project will contribute to the development of a goal-based regulatory framework on the use of hydrogen and hydrogen-based alternative fuels for waterborne transport. It will identify and ensure the correct management of risks in all design and operational aspects. It will establish the relevant objectives and the functional requirements for the use of hydrogen, consistent with the provisions of SOLAS chapter II-282 for the fuel system components, installation and energy converters.
The scope of the project should therefore include:
A review of the current regulatory framework, identifying obstacles and barriers, needs, challenges etc.;
Technical knowledge to support the discussions for the development of a coherent regulatory framework for risk assessment and risk management of gaseous and liquid hydrogen (GH2 and LH2) and hydrogen-based alternative fuels on ships;
A roadmap to add GH2, LH2 and hydrogen-based alternative fuels to the IGF Code in practical consistent manner e.g. referring to fuels already addressed by the Code.
With reference to the above roadmap, all the following points should be addressed from a regulatory point of view:
Ship design and arrangements for the use of GH2, LH2 or other H2-based fuels;
Bunkering procedures and logistic interface at port;
Fuel storage and distribution to systems on-board;
Materials, components and general piping design for H2 containment and handling;
H2 power generation and management systems;
Active and passive safety systems for fire and explosion prevention, including ventilation and exhaust systems, integrated automation, safety monitoring and control systems;
Operational best practices, condition-based monitoring and maintenance.
As regards the technical knowledge the project should also:
Define and validate the most appropriate science-based safety engineering and Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models to support designers in minimising risk in early design stage;
Draft guidelines for the integration of fuel cell power generation systems in the ship network;
Define requirements for the ship interactions at port (bunkering, refilling etc.).
Materials and components for the containment and distribution of hydrogen-rich fuels on-board should be carefully selected, analysed and tested to ensure the expected performance in the wide range of operational pressures and temperatures. To carry out these R&D activities, a strong partnership with all stakeholders is recommended: shipbuilders, ship designers, technology providers, research centres, ship operators, classification societies, experts in the production/handling /transport/bunkering of hydrogen, local authorities.
Such teamwork among all stakeholders is necessary to pave the way for a seamless cooperation at IMO level. To finalize the provisions of a dedicated chapter of the IGF Code dedicated to hydrogen, the proposal should:
Establish a cooperation with IMO and other relevant organizations (ISO-TC197 [83], IEC TC 105 [84]) to facilitate the discussion and the uptake of the necessary provisions;
Seek feedback from existing applications, best practices, reference from other industrial sectors, available technologies, safety procedures in design and operation, human element aspects etc.
It is expected that the project will setup an international advisory board to support the R&D activities and the continuation of the activities afterwards, interacting with the IMO throughout the process.
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
The FCH 2 JU considers that the proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2.5 million, including the analysis and testing of the materials, would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of supplementing proposals, requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 4 years.

Expected Impact:
The project is expected to deliver:
Unique experimental data concerning the interaction of hydrogen with maritime infrastructure (materials, ships, bunkering installations and harbours) to support further development and validation of relevant physics models, simulation and risk assessment tools;
Review of existing standards against new and missing knowledge to suggest the implementation and modification of international standards;
Guidelines for safe design for the new IGF chapter on hydrogen based on the experimental results and simulations, implementation and operations of H2-fueled ships which would support the authorization process of National Administrations;
Commonly agreed, scientifically based recommendations for the update of relevant RCS will lead to a more harmonised normative landscape and level up the safety culture in general;
A boost in the entry into the market of commercial passenger ships based on hydrogen and fuel cells, and in the scaling-up of hydrogen technologies.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A firm basis needs to be prepared for an EU-wide human resources development of scientists and especially engineers to feed the growing European fuel cell and hydrogen (FCH) industry. The SET-Plan Education, established in 2012/2013, expected a human resource of 57,000 highly skilled staff required by 2020, and 190,000 by 2030 in the FCH business. Supplying this resource is a major challenge in reliably building the FCH value and supply chain.
The SET-Plan Education identified a number of activities in university and vocational education, covering BSc/BEng, MSc/MEng, and PhD training across the EU that would be necessary in securing the education for the numbers of skilled workers needed in the future. The deficits identified were the lack of high quality teaching material and lack of student access to courses across Europe, as well as the lack of mobility incentives, including staff exchanges between academia and industry. The challenge addressed here is to devise a structure through which FCH education can be delivered at a high quality throughout Europe and be fully recognised and integrated into the European university and vocational educational system. Specific challenges are the harmonisation of teaching material, the accreditation of courses, the recognition of credit points, and the integration of the industrial perspective into teaching.
At the level of the FCH JU a number of activities in education have been completed or are still under way. The projects TrainHy, HyProfessionals, HyFacts, HyResponse, and KnowHy have been developing elements of teaching, e-learning, and practical training for a variety of target groups, ranging from university degrees over technician training to specific training of stakeholders and emergency crews. This project will build on the currently fragmented outcomes of these projects and integrate them into a new body of teaching, educational material, and courses offered across Europe at the quality level of university education (BSc/BEng/MSc/MEng/PhD and vocational training equivalents).
This activity calls for university-level education, both for scientists and engineers, looking at the highest skilled workforce of scientists and engineers totalling 17,000 in 2020 and 50,000 in 2030 (SET-Plan). Currently, HEI (Higher Education Institutions) in the EU are annually turning out about 250 to 350 PhD students with a specialisation in FCH technologies and about 1,000 graduates (BSc/BEng/MSc/MEng) with general knowledge in the area. These numbers clearly need to be stepped up. Currently the main bottleneck is the limited number of universities offering specialised training due to limited resources and lack of trained lecturers.
Scope:
This project is to develop the means for proliferating FCH education across the EU and offer students’ access to courses independent of the specialisation of the university they are enrolled at. In order to do this it will build a cluster of universities and other educational institutions that will lead and coordinate the activities related to FCH at the qualification level of university undergraduate and graduate training. The cluster will represent this topic and its community towards EU level stakeholders.
The network cluster will harmonise high-level training across Europe to make best use of teaching resources and offer the highest quality of educational FCH material to as many students as possible. It shall be positioned to become a representative of FCH training, in order to act as a “single stop shop” and “single voice“ with respect to associations such as EPUE, European University Association, etc. and monitoring, leading, or guiding any initiative in this field at European level.
The project will create a cluster of EU universities and other HEI that will lead and coordinate FCH training activities across Europe. It will establish a core body of harmonised teaching material and offer a platform centre of access for students across the EU to receive education in FCH technologies at the level of graduate (BSc/BEng/MSc/MEng) and postgraduate training, including the equivalent level in vocational training, and Continuous Professional Development (CPD). It will include not only universities but also other vocational training institutions that can represent the industrial perspective. By taking resource to the same teaching material, vocational training institutions closer to industry than to HEI can profit from the activities of the project. The project will run exchange programmes with industry in order to both deliver the industrial context to the HEI as well as allowing industry access to quality training material. Integrating CPD elements will further strengthen the aspect of delivering training capacity to industry and shall be fully integrated into the educational framework. All network partners need to be able to attribute ECTS points or equivalent (convertible) credits to their courses.
Based on an in-depth analysis of European market's needs in terms of educational demand in the area of FCH and a review of all previous FCH JU projects and EU initiatives, the project will deliver an educational framework that is benchmarked with other regions of the world that currently have successful programmes in place. Building on this analysis and using results from previous projects, it will create a harmonised teaching programme across the network. Local delivery might vary according to the national educational system but will adhere to the same principles and build on the same base material. All content will be fully accredited for ECTS points (and equivalent, convertible) schemes. A structured mechanism of systematically and continuously updating and improving the teaching material in line with future directions of teaching (including e-learning) and FCH technology will be implemented.
The project will
install a cluster of a minimum of 10 universities and other HEI that will take the lead in providing FCH topic education across Europe, mostly in countries which have adopted the AFI Directive; this cluster will use and regularly amend a common body of teaching materials and platforms integrating results from previous projects in order to build a repository of teaching content, tools, knowledge, databases, etc. dedicated to undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate courses for FCH training activities across Europe;
offer joint courses or minimum harmonised local courses that address undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels of university (BSc/BEng/MSc/MEng/PhD) as well as the corresponding vocational training levels; all courses need to carry ECTS points (or convertible equivalents) and all partners thus must be in a position to grant ECTS points or equivalent (convertible) credits;
proposed programme should envisage setting-up of a cross-European challenge-based contest to stimulate academic community and raise the attractiveness of the FCH curricula;
perform a trial course at a minimum of five partner institutions in year 2 of the project and full course runs in year 3 and 4 (length depending on 12, 18, or 24 month duration of courses) with a minimum of 20 students enrolled per course in Year 4;
perform and schedule trial courses at a minimum of five partner institutions at the first stage of project and full courses in the second stage of project with a minimum of 20 students enrolled per course. (length of courses should be in accordance to the thematic lectures)
include CPD schemes in the network activities, cooperating closely with the vocational training partners;
provide a web access point or use an existing web based platform to host the teaching materials and give students across Europe access, including the provision of e-learning and communication instruments;
provide Massive Open Online Courses, MOOC’s as a tool for delivering teaching content but also addressing the general public and stakeholders in the FCH area;
establish a student and staff exchange programme between educational and vocational training institutions and industry with minimum 30 exchanges across the programme;
set up an industry advisory board to inform educational activities of industry needs and future technological trends;
set up an associate network of universities participating in the activities of the project without being a partner in order to smoothly expand activities post-project;
include provision of all material in a minimum of five EU languages;
establish a business model to continue and maintain the network after completion of the project with the aim of seamlessly continuing the delivery of courses and educational materials post-project; the cluster should be able to continue its activities for at least 5 years post-project;
organise alumni and student conferences and workshop meetings of graduates from its own programme and previous programmes;
The topic should be specifically open towards and integrate EU13 Member States applicants. Collaboration with relevant international partners from IPHE countries is recommended.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 0.75 - million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 2-3 years
Expected Impact:
The project will:
allow students across Europe access to high quality, harmonised, and certified training material in FCH; courses will be credit bearing and support training in general and specific topics in FCH for building the HR resource necessary to staff the market introduction of FCH technologies;
address undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate university students, as well as young professionals in industry; it will deliver courses and teaching material suitable for obtaining credits for CPD schemes and build a bridge between university and vocational type training at the highest skill level;
offer a staff and student exchange programme across Europe between participating HEI, vocational training institutions and industry, giving a broader perspective to both the educational and commercial participants;
train the general public, politicians, and other stakeholders in FCH content in the form of MOOCs and general educational material and short courses;
boost industrial R&D by offering education and training, as well as exposure to university type research approaches and equipment; likewise it will encourage students and research fellows to take opportunity of industrial placements to augment their knowledge of industrial processes and perspectives

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The ambition of the FCH 2 JU is to develop clean, efficient and affordable solutions that fully demonstrate the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier and of fuel cells as energy convertor. The provision of clean, efficient and affordable solutions calls for a holistic assessment of the systems from a sustainable development point of view. A methodological framework is therefore needed that takes a comprehensive set of aspects into account in a standardised way.
Besides, the methodological framework needs to go beyond the outcomes provided by the FC-HyGuide guidance documents [91] already established by the FCH 2 JU projects “HyGuide” and “H2FC-LCA” in 2011 regarding the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of fuel cell and hydrogen (FCH) systems. For instance, the guidelines provided in these documents need to be checked for relevance and appropriateness regarding scope. To demonstrate environmental, economic and social trade-offs of alternative FCH systems, valid and fair comparisons with competing products should be conducted following a consistent, harmonised methodological approach. To facilitate such comparisons, high-quality information on the materials, energy and other resources needed for the manufacturing, operation and end-of-life of these systems need to be available as well.
When dealing with these challenges, contributions not only from previous projects such as FC-HyGuide but also from international platforms such as the International Energy Agency Hydrogen Task 36 [92] should be considered in order to facilitate the future standardisation of the methodological framework by providing robust and comprehensive guidelines for the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) of FCH systems.
[91] http://www.fc-hyguide.eu/
[92] http://ieahydrogen.org/pdfs/IEA-HIA_Task36_final-report_Jan2019_wCover.aspx
Scope:
The overall goal of this topic is to establish a methodological framework stating requirements and providing guidance on how to conduct an LCSA of FCH technologies and applications providing a framework for a fair comparison against competing technical solutions. To this end, the proposal should address the following activities:
Identification of development needs concerning the FC-HyGuide guidance documents based on experience made with applying these guidance documents in projects funded through the FCH JU or the FCH 2 JU [93], such as projects ene.field and HyTechCycling, and taking into account relevant examples of LCAs (potentially also including economic and social dimensions) that did not follow these guidelines;
Updating those guidance documents according to these development needs and following ISO standards 14040 and 14044 including their amendments and the ILCD handbook; thereby also new technologies and new fields of application and the potential comparison of these systems with competing technical solutions should be taken into account; this includes prospective methods to allow a fair comparison between rather mature technologies and those for which progress in their development is fast;
Extending the assessment framework to include social and economic indicators, including the criticality of raw materials. Recommendations regarding the environmental, economic and social impact assessment methods to be used should draw on current best practice and recommendations from the JRC;
Collecting robust and up-to-date environmental, social and economic life cycle inventory data on selected FCH systems and a set of prioritised competing technical solutions. The data should be made publicly available, for example through the EU platform on life cycle assessment hosted by the JRC [94]. A third-party review of the data should be conducted;
Demonstrating the practicability and implications of the developed guidelines in at least one test application case for FCs and one for H2 production systems. A third-party review of the guidelines should be conducted.
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3.5 years (including the development, application and internal/external verification of methodology and data).

Expected Impact:
The project should establish guidance regarding life cycle sustainability assessment of FCH systems from an environmental, economic and social perspective. Therefore the expected impacts should include:
Providing a robust framework for a transparent, harmonised and up-to-date LCSA of FCH systems as well as for a fair comparison between competing technical solutions. This framework also allows assessing consistently the extent to which production costs of FCH systems are expected to be reduced;
Proposing a material criticality indicator, to be assessed based on life cycle inventory data;
Facilitating the sustainability benchmarking of FCH systems against competing technical solutions by publicly providing high-quality data, including data on specific materials (e.g. ceramics in solid-oxide cells, carbon fibres) and their costs, data on processes (e.g. auxiliary materials and energy demand), recycling scenarios, economic performance and social aspects of the FCH systems and their alternatives. This includes prospective methods as regards cost and technical performance developments;
Supporting the International “Mission Innovation” initiative as regards the development of clean(er) energy;
Facilitating the spread of the knowledge e.g. integrating the data and guidance documents from the project into one or two already existing platforms (e.g. a dedicated webpage on LCA hosted by the FCH 2 JU, yet to be established).

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: This topic specifically builds on previous projects TrainHy, HyProfessionals and HyFacts and will work with current HyResponse (first responder training) and projects KnowHy (2013 call, e-learning platform for technicians training) as far as sensible and appropriate. Whilst the named projects concentrated on developing the basis of fuel cell and hydrogen-related teaching, for instance in the way of developing a curriculum, this project will now fill these structures by building a network of academic institutions that will develop and provide the adequate teaching material, also integrating vocational training institutes, industry, research organisations and other relevant actors along the technology value chains, which will allow regular updates and supply of relevant educational material. The project extends the scope in providing teaching materials for courses and e-learning and supplying these to the European lecturer community. Universities prepared to participate in the supporting network of the project will be able to access this material as a support to high quality teaching throughout Europe. The emphasis is on university (graduate and post-graduate) teaching and the equivalent level of vocational training (e.g. in processes of continuous professional development etc.).
The supply of high quality teaching and learning material is essential in building the vast human resources needed for further developing and commercialising fuel cell and hydrogen technology. The university type material can also be ‘downgraded’ and used for specific target groups (e.g. regulators, first responders etc.) and later also secondary schools since the curriculum structure has a general validity.
The described activities and approaches are in line with the educational activities in the area of fuel cells and hydrogen laid out in the SET-Plan Education and Training Roadmap (http://setis.ec.europa.eu/setis-deliverables/education-training-roadmap).
Scope:  The project will develop teaching and experimental material, also in cooperation with business and research organisations, for use in university and vocational training. This will be presented on a web-site in the sense of a source of curriculum structure, of teaching content, and as an e-learning platform. The goal is to integrate such content into (for instance) Massive Open Online Course platforms like OpenupEd or similar. This would be the subject of a further call in 2 to 3 years’ time. The project should include or cooperate with university networks with the goal of harmonising teaching materials and concepts and supplying high quality material, as well as for the development of joint degree programmes when of interest to the participating institutions. Activities will include developing access to research and industrial infrastructures in order to allow practical training in real environment. They shall incorporate concepts and elements of the roadmaps developed in other EU contexts, specifically the SET-Plan Education and Training Roadmap.
The project should also take stock of, and include where possible, educational material already produced elsewhere (e.g. as available from the US DoE) in order not to replicate existing material.
Expected impact:
•             Preparation of teaching material to cover the TrainHy curriculum in the form of presentations, scripts handbooks, lecture notes, videos, audio, simulations, tests, etc, for student learning and lecturer preparation; focus on learning outcomes; coverage of a reasonable number of EU languages to make sufficient impact on undergraduate teaching
•             Establishment of a network of universities (interacting also with partners outside of the project consortium) participating in quality assurance of teaching material and using the material in their (local) courses
•             Establishment of close links to business and research institutes in order to allow quality and timely update of the curricula, access to physical or virtual research infrastructure for training purposes, as well as mobility of students and staff
•             Mutual recognition of credit points for the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS according to the Bologna process) throughout this network
•             Installation of  a web-site hosting this teaching material for access by associated universities
•             Installation of a web-site suitable for e-learning or integration into existing, more general platforms and performance of prototype courses
•             Update on TrainHy curriculum development
•             Expansion of blueprints for experimental equipment developed in TrainHy
•             Delivery of educational courses (integration of modules in existing curricula, new courses, summer schools, hydrogen and fuel cell infrastructure dissemination etc.) as developed by TrainHy and HyProfessionals within the project duration (minimum for three years), development of joint–degree programmes when of interest to the participating institutions
•             Establishment of a concept how sub-sets of the material or adapted versions can be used for training of specialised staff, for instance with regulators, permit authorities, and certification bodies and any other organisations active in the fuel cells and hydrogen area; development of at least prototype courses covering this clientele
Development of a concept how the material provided by the project can be adopted for secondary schools and public displays as laid out in the SET-Plan Education and Training Roadmap; prototype material may be developed in the project but this is not an essential requirement."

","Coordination & support action
","05 May 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
As fuel cell and hydrogen technologies are commercialised they will be required to meet environmental standards and minimise impact, and part of this will be the ability to recycle and dismantle products at the end-of-life. For example FCEVs will be required to be safely dismantled, and materials and components recycled as is the case for current conventional vehicle technologies. Until alternative materials are found, it is important to recycle critical and scarce materials, such as precious metals used in fuel cell stacks and fuel processing sub-systems.
Scope:
Research and technological development is required on the recycling and end-of-life treatment of materials and components. An initial action assessing the existing and proposing new recycling and dismantling technologies and application specific requirements will be necessary to provide guidelines for the recycling on FCH technology components. This is also an important precursor to further development and demonstration work. Besides, it is fundamental to involve stakeholders to harmonize procedures and prove the economic feasibility of the concept as early as possible.
To achieve these goals, the activities under this call should contribute to:
Evaluation of existing recycling and newly developed technologies and their applicability to FCH materials and components
Identify critical raw and rare materials and components for which new strategies and technologies have to be developed and the technological challenges related to this, taking existing EU initiatives into account (e.g. SETIS reports and activities within the European Partnership for Innovation)
Compliance with European and national regulations about recycling, specially the Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC)
Harmonization and regulatory proposals of new strategies and technologies for the phase of recycling and dismantling considering all the actors involved in the lifetime of the product (from manufacturers to dismantling, reuse and recycling entities including end/industrial users)
Development of Life Cycle Assessment models for fuel cells and hydrogen technologies (considering the International Reference Life Cycle Data System, ILCD, Handbook on LCA and following the HyGuide recommendations) looking for and quantifying possible energy and cost reductions linked to the proposed new strategies and technologies in the phase of recycling and dismantling
Business model on how to motivate, regulate, promote and make economically feasible the use of the new strategies and technologies proposed, especially considering the manufacturing industry
Recommendations for introduction of new processes (e.g. recovery of critical materials from FCH products) and re-adaptation of recycling centres so that the new strategies and technologies proposed can be effectively implemented
Event/showcase in a recycling centre showing the implementation of the new strategies and technologies proposed for at least one FCH product
Expected Impact:
Provide guidance on the future need and focus of recycling strategies in common for both the stationary and the transport sector
Establishing a road map for recycling and dismantling strategies within FCH technologies
Harmonize procedures for the phase of recycling and dismantling at EU level
Pave the way for future large demonstration projects validating the business model proposed
Proposals should build upon the experience of previous projects on LCA (including activities covered under the European Green Vehicle Initiative) and consider the application of LCA methodologies developed in FC-HyGuide project."

","Coordination & support action
","09 July 2014
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Public acceptance of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies can be generally regarded as positive - with some safety issues still remaining significant. Global macro benefits remain not widely quantified and known: key features on fuel cells and hydrogen specificities and advantages are not well displayed in an easy to access format, as for instance dedicated internet platforms; introductions to technology uses and supporting demonstrators, apart from cars, are not sufficiently available either. This explains that the public seems to be relatively indifferent to developments regardless of the opportunities offered by these technologies.
Insofar the problem lies not so much with performing research into whether the public would accept widespread employment of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, but to make the public, including all stakeholders, increasingly aware of the potential of these technologies in order to prepare a commercial market entry, through a widely accepted vision of its macro benefits, concrete facts and figures on hydrogen and on safety and reliability issues, and clever and simple demonstration items and exhibits easy to display and use for a general public audience (for instance fuel cell assisted electric bicycles, mobile charging devices for personal computers and phones, and other gadgets suitable for public exhibitions).
Scope:  The overall objective is to increase public awareness of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies and deliver well-founded information on opportunities and risk management (fight the fear) by developing a strategy to explain these technologies to the general public and to private and public bodies (future potential clients). In order to do so, the consortium will need to include a range of economic academics mastering energy transition matters and issues, marketing and communication experts, and web communication agencies.
We expect the consortium to build a web platform, and to design and use innovative communication tools and the social media to allow the targeted audiences to better understand the opportunities and risk management of fuel cell and hydrogen technology implementation through a multi stage contributive approach.
Expected impact:
•             Supply of an overview study compiling the many existing studies showing the potential long term macro benefits of displaying technologies in terms of innovation, job creation, energy security and balance, and health in the European Union
•             Dissemination of the results of this meta-study through a well-defined media strategy and development of the associated communication kit reaching out to policy makers at European and national levels
•             Supply of a one-stop-shop for information around hydrogen and fuel cell technologies by design and implementation of an internet communication strategy based on a specialised web portal (e.g. news aggregator, social media, videos, mobile apps, games, case-studies, etc.). The platform web site has to document fuel cell and hydrogen technologies, including facts and figures, opportunities and risk management that will set the scene for the fuel cell and hydrogen sector for different key audiences, relay key news, structure the policy and public debates and propose debates on questions, concerns and issues around the technology
•             Improved public information by supply of technical content suitable for the general public to platforms such as Wikipedia and others
•             Supply of demonstrational items (other than vehicles) for exhibitions, fairs and other events that constitute a basic mobile lighthouse set of objects that can be easily displayed and used for the public in any blue / green society / green mobility event

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To support funding and coordination of partnering projects (PPs) of the two Flagships.
PPs are projects supported by national/regional funding agencies and/or by private funding. They are addressing areas relevant for the Flagships and contribute to their objectives. Their role and activities and their integration into the Flagships were described in the above mentioned Staff Working Document[1].
The aim is to bring together national funding agencies from Member States and Associated Countries to fund such PPs, as well as supporting these and other PPs in their networking, coordination and participation in Flagship activities.
Scope:
Proposals should address a single of the two following subtopics:
a. ERA-NET Cofund action: one follow-up action to the FLAG-ERA ERANET (http://www.flagera.eu/) aiming to coordinate national and regional research programmes to fund PPs of the two Flagships through a joint transnational call for proposals (resulting in grants to third parties) between several such programmes complemented by EU co-funding, possibly followed by further calls for proposals without EU co-funding. The action may also organise additional joint activities between the participating funding agencies in support of the two Flagships.
b. Coordination and Support action: one action will be funded which will support all of the following points, for both Flagships:
the participation of PPs in meetings, workshops or other relevant activities organised by the Core Project of each Flagship;
the participation of PPs in the governance activities of each of the Flagships;
the networking and coordination of the PPs for helping them contribute to the research roadmaps of each Flagship and for disseminating their activities to promote Flagships at the regional/national level.
Proposals under this subtopic need to demonstrate how they add value beyond the activities already foreseen in the Flagships to liaise with PPs.
The action under this subtopic should be driven by (one or more) stakeholders representing relevant scientific communities.
Expected Impact:
a. ERA-NET Cofund action
Closer coordination and greater mobilisation and pooling of resources between regional, national and EU research programmes for realising the research goals of the FET Flagships;
b. Coordination and Support Action
Creating mutual benefit between the PPs and their Core Project, enhancing the impact of the Flagships on national and regional research programmes and fostering the role of PPs in the governance of the Flagships.

","18 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
FET Flagships are science- and technology-driven, large-scale, multidisciplinary research initiatives built around a visionary unifying goal. They tackle grand science and technology (S&T) challenges requiring cooperation among a range of disciplines, communities and programmes. FET Flagships should provide a strong and broad basis for future innovation and economic exploitation, as well as novel benefits for society of a potential high impact. The overarching nature and magnitude implies that they can only be realised through a collaborative, long-term sustained cooperation effort. This topic aims at launching Coordination and Support Actions (CSA) to prepare new candidate FET Flagships.
Scope:
Proposals should contain a description of a potential FET Flagship and how this is to be matured over the course of the preparatory action into a more complete blueprint.
Firstly, proposals should describe the FET Flagship initiative they propose to further develop through this preparatory action, by specifically addressing the following three key issues:
What makes this a FET Flagship: what is the unifying goal, the grand S&T challenge and the underlying vision; why is this a grand challenge and what makes it a ""game-changer""; what are its main goals and objectives; and what are the technologies, including digital technologies, that it would advance.
Impact (why it is good for Europe): will it bring major impact on economy and society as well as on science and technology; why and how is it relevant for the European industry; how does it build on existing scientific excellence in Europe; what is its innovation potential that would benefit Europe's economy and/or society; how would it uniquely position Europe with respect to relevant developments and initiatives existing in other regions in the world.
Integration and European added value: is it well positioned to address its grand S&T challenge in terms of large-scale integration across disciplines and the involvement of relevant stakeholders from academia, industry and society at large; does critical mass in terms of research excellence and industrial capabilities exist in Europe needed to address the challenge; what is the estimated scale of the effort required to reach the objectives and how long will it take to do so; and, are there similar initiatives existing at regional, national or European level and what is the added value of such an effort.
Secondly, proposals should describe how the activities of the preparatory action will involve stakeholders over the course of up to 12 months (indicative), to arrive at a complete design and description of a candidate FET Flagship initiative. Specifically, they should describe the proposed activities for further developing the Flagship's unifying goal and its underlying S&T roadmap; attracting industry's endorsement and participation; further developing their consortium and its governance structure and attracting large public support.
Proposals should consider multidisciplinary aspects, including where relevant social sciences and humanities. They must also describe a clear strategy for dissemination and citizen engagement; and, in close cooperation with other proposals for preparatory actions that will be selected from this call, jointly organise and participate in an event addressing stakeholders including scientific communities, policy makers and the wider public and aiming at disseminating the main objectives and findings of the actions.
At the end of the action, the design and description of the candidate Flagship should include the following elements:
A consolidated vision based on a well-defined unifying goal articulated in terms of S&T objectives and of its targeted impact on economy and society.
A strategic long-term research roadmap, showing how the unifying goal can be realised and what the major milestones are, situating the Flagship in the global landscape and demonstrating a credible path towards societal impact, technology development, innovation and exploitation.
A blueprint for the Flagship's implementation setting out the overall collaboration and S&T framework, the identification of necessary competencies and resources including infrastructure aspects, and openness of the initiative.
An effective scientific leadership and governance structure based on lessons learned from the present Flagships, describing the coordination and decision-making structures of the Flagship, the role of industry and the relations with Member States and countries associated with Horizon 2020, with the Commission and with the relevant funding agencies and national research initiatives.
Support from and involvement of industry, giving a view on avenues for exploitation and further strengthening of European industry in the global landscape, including stimulating the emergence and growth of innovative value chains.
An approach to address responsible research and innovation, in particular aspects such as education, gender aspects and societal, ethical and legal implications.
Proposals for candidate FET Flagships must target a visionary unifying goal within one of the following three main areas: ICT and Connected Society; Health and Life Sciences; or Energy, Environment and Climate change. They should present a multidisciplinary approach that brings together the relevant communities to address their unifying goal. Proposals must clearly specify which of the three areas they target. In each of these areas at least one and at most two proposals for Flagship preparatory actions will be selected for funding.
(1) ICT and Connected Society
The proposal should address any of the following sub-areas in part or in whole:
Smart Materials and Nanoscale Engineering: Novel nano-engineered materials and systems with properties enabling the design and manufacturing of radically new ICT components and devices creating disruptive technologies and market opportunities, for example in energy efficiency, data processing, smart manufacturing, smart interfaces, nano-bio devices, etc.
Robotics, Interfaces and Artificial Intelligence: a new generation of robotics technologies including soft and flexible robotics, bio-inspired robotics, new approaches to human-machine interaction and cooperation, cognition and artificial intelligence, giving rise to much smarter systems performing sophisticated functions opening radically new opportunities to address societal and economic challenges.
ICT for Social Interaction and Culture: new ICT technologies and approaches for empowering deep social interactions across diverse cultures, languages, goals, values, etc.; for understanding large-scale complex socio-technical systems and their interactions, interdependencies and evolutions and avenues for exploiting this understanding; and/or for collecting, preserving, studying and promoting Europe's unique cultural heritage and exploiting these to achieve major societal or economic benefits.
(2) Health and the Life Sciences
The proposal should address any of the following sub-areas in part or in whole:
Disruptive technologies to Revolutionise Healthcare: New technologies and approaches aiming at a paradigm shift in the field of individualised prevention, prediction and treatment of diseases. This includes among others bioinformatics and modelling approaches to use patients' genetic expression patterns, metabolism and derived systems; novel and innovative nano-medicine approaches (e.g. technologies for novel sensors and imaging, organ-on-a-chip and bio-electronic medicine, drug delivery, …); network medicine; neuro-prosthetic technologies; regenerative medicine and biofabrication techniques to reprogram or replace human cells, tissues and whole organs and to integrate these in functioning body systems.
Understanding Life by Exploring the Genome and the Cell: Novel technologies and approaches that enable a paradigm shift in studying and understanding the foundational building blocks of life, for example the functioning of the cell, and of cells within organisms, including structure and dynamics, and the full multi-omics (genome/epigenome/proteome/metabolome/connectome etc.) and their interactions. This will open up radically new opportunities such as developing novel nano-bio devices and technologies, advanced screening methods and analytical and morphological technologies, advanced therapies and contribute to the understanding of biological processes and pathological mechanisms.
(3) Energy, Environment and Climate change
The proposal should address any of the following sub-areas in part or in whole:
Earth, Climate Change and Natural Resources: New technologies and approaches for high-precision modelling and simulation, including the necessary data integration, that enable an in-depth understanding of the earth, natural hazards and climate change. Their exploitation and use should open up new opportunities for helping to manage/mitigate their effects and impacts on human activity and natural resources in a sustainable way in specific areas such as: agriculture (ensuring food security and sustainable farming), forestry, fisheries, protecting/restoring natural ecosystems, energy supply and demand, etc.
Radically new Energy Production, Conversion and Storage devices and systems: Disruptive technologies aiming at a paradigm shift in renewable energy by exploring and exploiting radically new principles and novel materials that can substantially reduce Europe's dependence on fossil fuels and open new industrial opportunities for their exploitation and sustainable development.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
For the CSA:
Fully developed candidate FET Flagship initiatives supported by key stakeholders (e.g., academic research communities, industry, public authorities …).
For the proposed Flagships:
Key benefits for economy and society based on significant advances on science and technology. This should be demonstrated by e.g. potential for S&T breakthroughs, industrial support, added value for Europe, potential for increasing European competitiveness, potential for societal benefits, etc.
Long-lasting structuring effect on research efforts in Europe, anchor point for international cooperation and the nurturing of talent through the training of a new generation of researchers.

Proposals are expected to address a mix of quantum technology challenges addressing one or more of the following areas, integrating different aspects like physics, engineering, computer science, theory, algorithms, software, manufacturing, control, infrastructures, etc. Each activity should clearly move the technology up the TRL scale[2]. For areas a. to d., proposals can integrate various activities covering the whole value chain, from fundamental to applied research, and with other types of activity, including demonstrators, etc., as appropriate.
a. Quantum Communication[3]: Development of state-of-the art network devices, applications and systems (memories, quantum repeaters, network equipment, high throughput miniaturised quantum random number generators, etc.) for quantum communication mesh-networks. Proposals should target cost-effective solutions, devices and systems compatible with existing communication networks and standard cryptography systems, as well as device-independent protocols. Each proposal should address aspects like engineering, protocols, certification, software, algorithms. Actions should include validation of the proposed solution, proof of its suitability for the targeted application and benchmarking with respect to relevant targets set by the CSA[4] in this area.
b. Quantum Computing Systems: The development of open quantum computer experimental systems and platforms[5], integrating the key building blocks such as quantum processors (>10qubits) with limited qubit overhead, control electronics, software stack, algorithms, applications, etc. Work should address the scalability towards large systems (>100 qubits), the verification and validation of the quantum computation, fault-tolerance and solving a concrete computational problem to demonstrate the quantum advantage. Projects should foresee benchmarking activities. Benchmarks will be identified by the CSA[4] for all the platforms selected in this area.
c. Quantum Simulation: Proposals should aim at delivering operational demonstrators, based on existing physical platforms that have shown a clear perspective to achieve more than 50 interacting quantum units and / or full local control. They should work towards demonstrating a certified quantum advantage for solving difficult scientific or industrial problems (e.g. material design, logistics, scheduling, machine learning, optimisation, artificial intelligence, drug discovery, etc.). The proposed solutions need to include the development of protocols, validation schemes and control, simulation software, system configuration and optimisation. Work should address the scalability towards larger systems with more qubits. Projects should foresee benchmarking activities related to real life applications. Benchmarks will be identified by the CSA[4] for all the platforms selected in this area. Hybrid architectures are also to be considered under this area when relevant.
d. Quantum Metrology and Sensing: Quantum sensors for specific application areas such as imaging, healthcare, geo-sciences, outdoor and indoor navigation, time or frequency, magnetic or electrical measurements, etc. … as well as novel measurement standards[8], making use of the advances in controlling the fundamental quantum properties. It is expected that the work will lead to practical sensing devices, imaging systems and quantum standards that employ quantum coherence and outperform classical counterparts (resolution, stability) targeting TRL 3 and 4 and showing potential for further miniaturisation/integration into industrial systems.
e. Fundamental science: Research and development of basic theories and components, addressing a foundational challenge of relevance for the development of quantum technologies in at least one of the four areas a.-d. described above, to improve the performance of the components or subsystems targeted in those areas. Proposals must clearly indicate how they support a challenge for one or more of these areas.
For areas a. to d., proposals should be based on a close cooperation between academia and industry, define output and impact KPIs[9], include technology benchmarking against other approaches, and include user requirements.
For areas a. to c. above, proposals should seek synergies with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes running in these areas. They shall clearly specify how they are connected to the programmes and / or how they will incorporate the platforms, testbeds and infrastructures existing in Europe, how they will attract and build communities around them for openly promoting further technology developments as well as testing and benchmarking in the field and how they build on top of these to create European added value. Proposals combining different sources of financing should include a concrete financial plan detailing the use of these funding sources for the different parts of their activities.
The Commission considers that proposals for Research and Innovation Actions of a 3-year duration and requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 10 million would allow the areas a. to d. to be addressed appropriately; and proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow the area e. to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals of another duration and/or requesting other amounts.
When appropriate, proposals may provide financial support to third parties established in a EU member state or country associated with Horizon 2020 and in line with the conditions set out in General Annex K, for example to access specific expertise or infrastructure. The consortium will define the selection process of third parties for which financial support will be granted (with a maximum of EUR 100 000[10] per party). A maximum of 10% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to this purpose.
All projects shall make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the Quantum Flagship and in particular: coordinate technical work with the other selected projects of the Flagship; and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under item B. below.
Note that special Grant Conditions will apply for projects granted under this topic. Please see under Call Conditions.
B. Coordination and Support Action
Proposals should aim at coordinating the relevant stakeholders, notably academia, RTOs and industry participating in the Flagship initiative. In particular, it is expected to establish a communication platform, facilitate dialogue, promote the objectives of the Flagship and monitor the progress, support the governance structure, organize outreach events (including addressing the impact of technology development on economy and society), identify training and education needs and promote European curricula in quantum engineering, identify and coordinate relevant standardisation, IPR actions, and international collaboration and help networking of respective national and international activities in the field. The action will also identify, together with the community, benchmarks for all communication/computing/simulation platforms selected under areas a. to c. of the Research and Innovation Actions described under item A. above.
It is expected that such an activity is driven by the relevant actors of the field including academia, RTOs and industry.
The Commission considers that proposals for Coordination and Support Actions requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

In order to kick-start a European industry in quantum computers, breakthroughs in miniaturization and scalability of quantum computing devices are needed, in particular for producing high-quality qubits that can be efficiently interconnected or scaled towards thousands of qubits, compatible with the fabrication techniques of the semiconductor industry. Moreover, Europe needs quantum software environments for quantum computers in order to address concrete industrial and scientific applications with expected quantum advantage.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to address a mix of quantum technology challenges integrating different aspects like physics, engineering, computer science, theory, algorithms, software, manufacturing, control, infrastructures, benchmarking and verification etc. Each activity should clearly move the technology up the TRL scale[1]. Proposals can integrate various activities covering the whole value chain, from fundamental to applied research, and with other types of activity, including demonstrators, etc., as appropriate.
(a) Hardware:
Hardware proposals are expected to develop a miniaturised qubit platform mass-manufacturable, and compatible with semiconductor processing, integrating quantum processors (>10qubits) of good-quality qubits. Work should address the verification and validation of the quantum computation, fault-tolerance, demonstrating high-fidelity (>99%) single and two-qubit gates. Proposals should demonstrate fast and efficient, high-fidelity (>99%) qubits operations including read, write, data transfer, etc…, and address the scalability towards large systems.
Work should include investigations into the industrial design, engineering and manufacturing processes necessary for mass-manufacturing the qubit platform and provide first experimental production lines. Proposals should aim at the development of open quantum computer experimental systems, and work on the reduction of their form factor. Proposed platforms should build on qubit technologies complementing the approaches of the running projects of the Quantum Technologies Flagship.
(b) Software:
Software proposals should target the development of quantum applications and the development of industrial use cases for the quantum computers of the Quantum Technologies Flagship. Furthermore, proposals should target the development of quantum software stacks, libraries, etc., that facilitate the link from a high-level description of algorithms to a low-level implementation with quantum gates, for solving concrete problems and applications expected to demonstrate quantum advantage. The developed applications and software should be independent of the underlying qubit platform and their correct functioning should be tested on all the quantum computing platforms of the Quantum Technologies Flagship.
All proposals should be based on a close cooperation between academia and industry, define output and impact KPIs[2], include technology benchmarking against other approaches, and include user requirements. In addition, for the hardware proposals, they should include benchmarking against different technologies. Relevant benchmarks will be identified by the Coordination and Support Action of the Quantum Technologies Flagship.
The Commission considers that proposals for Research and Innovation Actions of a 4-year duration and requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 15 million for Hardware and up to EUR 4,70 million for Software, would allow the challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
As indicated in the grant conditions, all projects shall conclude a written collaboration agreement with the Quantum Technologies Flagship funded projects to actively participate in the common activities of the Quantum Technologies Flagship and in particular: Coordinate technical work with the other selected projects of the Flagship; and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The potential of neuromorphic computing has been only partially explored so far. Compared to biological neural networks, current neuron/dendrite models are simple, the networks small and learning models appear to be rather basic. The implementations are often VLSI-based CMOS with little resemblance to the substrate of their biological counterparts, and too power-hungry. The challenge is to exploit a wider range of biological principles from the hardware level up (e.g., neuro-mimicking materials and principles – electronic, photonic, ionic,… – , 3D networks, higher degrees of connectivity, cross-connectivity, spiking, rate-based and population-level neuronal dynamics, oscillations, plasticity, parallelism, etc.) and from the cognitive level down, by developing the related algorithms and programming framework, in order to create neuromorphic technologies that can outperform current systems in terms of size, scalability, connectivity, power consumption, ease of training, flexibility, reliability or any other relevant metrics.
Scope:
proposals will target new computational substrates and engines, based on new materials and engineering principles for efficient and low-power neuromorphic computing; together with new theories, architectures and algorithms for neuromorphic computation (classification, control,…), learning (including unsupervised, incremental, single-shot and/or event-based) and adaptation/plasticity for and in such new neuromorphic hardware.
These should be brought together in systems or artefacts that demonstrate clear advantages for replacing or complementing state-of-the-art conventional approaches in challenging end-to-end scenarios of use (e.g., on-line edge computing, personalisation, embedded, robotic/agent control,…) in various fields of applications.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 5 million and with a duration of up to 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will contribute to:
Bring neuromorphic engineering at the level where it can be benchmarked in terms of performance, power consumption, size, latency or other relevant metric e.g., for learning capacity, speed or plasticity, and its interfaces be standardised;
Pave the way to market take-up of neuromorphic computing in a range of existing and new application areas, with demonstrable advantages, either as stand-alone or complementing more conventional solutions;
Stimulate the emergence of a European innovation ecosystem around neuromorphic engineering, well beyond the world of research alone."

Additive Manufacturing (AM), including 3D-Printing, is one of the potential game changers that, for some applications, has already reached a tipping point of maturity. European companies are still strong in some areas but this position requires high levels of continuous innovation, especially where competitors are fast approaching. There are also other areas that are comparatively less developed and where the technology transfer and adoption is not functional, leading to a slow uptake of the results.
Despite the EC support, in the global picture the competitiveness of the European companies is threatened by important investments at international level. Moreover, some of the more fundamental aspects in order to take advantage of this promising technology still need to be addressed.
It is necessary to identify current bottlenecks and barriers to further development of AM technologies in Europe. Furthermore the stakeholders also need to be mobilised in order to exploit the business opportunities that AM provides, facilitating the take-up of this technology in Europe, with a focussed promotion and support strategy for Additive Manufacturing technologies.
Scope:
The proposals should address most of the following aspects:
Identification of gaps and opportunities for further research and innovation, as well as non-technological gaps in order to develop policy framework recommendations (e.g. regulation, standardisation, public procurement).
Community building activities (think-and-do-tank) and actions to foster dialogue and collaboration across levels (stakeholders and governance) and with key strategic partners, the Member States and the European Commission. This broad multi-stakeholder community (science, policy, business, society) at local, regional, national and EU level will enable the launching of innovation partnerships for developing and testing of AM.
Assessment of the current regulatory and IPR frameworks, micro- and macro-economic assessment of opportunities and risks and its impact on social aspects and labour market benefits.
Productivity and resource efficiency gains through AM and its impact on European competitiveness through localised manufacturing, where more goods will be manufactured on demand, individually designed and close to their point of consumption.
Identification of current bottlenecks for the transferability of new technologies across sectors.
Development of best practices to help stakeholders to achieve large scale deployment.
Identification of bottlenecks that prevent the stimulation of investments in new AM technologies and promote successful innovative AM solutions.
Support information exchange and collaboration between EU funded projects which address the same AM areas to exploit synergies, particularly through SMEs.
Development of new integrated design and manufacturing paradigms, where the time to replan, reprogramme and evolve in the shop floor production is reduced.
Building skills capacity for innovation and competitiveness, engaging with academia for the development of learning resources adaptable to different learning approaches and curricula at undergraduate, master, and life-long learning levels.
Assesment of the current regulatory and IPR frameworks; anti-counterfeiting features, particularly where high value and/or safety critical components are being manufactured; micro- and macro-economic assessment of opportunities and risks; and its impact on social aspects and labour market benefits.
Proposals should include the organisation of workshops with top-ranked international experts and EC services from the various disciplines aiming at the elaboration of a future AM roadmap, as well as an International Conference on AM at the end of the project.
In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the research effort, the active participation of industrial partners represents an added value to the activities and this will be reflected in the evaluation, under the criteria Implementation and Impact.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 750000 and 1000000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
The proposals are expected to have an impact on the European AM community in the following ways:
Create a network of research and industry partners for further RTD and industrial innovation and contribute to the sharing of European best practices.
Create links and foster collaboration with relevant European initiatives and activities, e.g. Additive Manufacturing Platform within the ManuFuture ETP and the Vanguard Initiative.
Speeding up industrial exploitation and take up of results of AM and facilitate cross-sectorial technology transfer.
Early awareness of key innovation developments and anticipation of business trends and market prospects.
Training and educational skills capacity in the AM community, both at academic and professional level.
Enabling regulatory authorities to address better the relevant issues based on a thorough assessment of the current legal framework, IPR management and standardisation needs.
Rationalising the process to deliver standardisation mandates to the European Standards Organisations.
Favour investment of financial players in additive technologies application.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
As a response to increasing competition in global markets, many industrial sectors (e.g. automotive, aerospace, tooling or packaging) aim at improving their product performances through surface functionalisation. As the products are increasingly complex in terms of scale (from nano to macro) and shape, processes need to deliver efficiently, ensuring an uncompromised quality together with high versatility and controlled costs. One way to reach this goal is to differentiate between a product body and its surface, where specific properties can be tailored. Furthermore, the required functionalities may be achieved with little or no addition of new raw material. For example, modifications in the surface geometry or even microstructure induced by texturing processes enable to improve the performance of those products by providing them with dedicated functionalities such as tailored friction, antibacterial properties, aesthetic issues or self-cleaning capabilities, among others.
In this context, substantial research is needed for exploring innovative approaches aimed at producing high added-value functional surfaces by a superficial modification of the substrate. Special attention should be paid to the cost efficiency of the novel surface manufacturing processes and to the development of technologies that are adaptable and up-scalable to real scale conditions and to their implementation into mass production conditions. Finally, environmental aspects of the processes should also be addressed.
Scope:
The proposal should address surface-modifying methods which do not alter the chemical composition of the surface or add an extra layer of a different material, for example: micro-machining, texturing, photon-based technologies, laser, mechanical treatments, etc. These methods should be used to create new manufacturing processes that can be applied on mass production lines. Due to the need for cost-effective technologies, these processes should be easy to integrate within the existing manufacturing plants and cost-effectiveness should be demonstrated. The research activities should be multi-disciplinary and address all of the following issues:
Development of cost-efficient, up-scalable and adaptable surface processing techniques that introduce micro- or nano-scale modifications at the surface level of the part providing it with specific properties or capabilities.
Design and implementation of specific methods and systems that enable highly efficient up-scaling of the developed processing techniques from laboratory scale to real scale, with a specific objective to apply the processes for mass production.
Implementation of modelling tools to support selection of the processing parameters that lead to the targeted surface modifications.
Solutions which are economically viable, environmentally friendly and easy to transfer to other fields than the demonstrated fields of application.
In-process inspection and monitoring possibilities to ensure that the final results remain within the quality requirements.
The projects are expected to cover applied research but also demonstration activities, such as testing a prototype in a simulated operational environment. The ability of the demonstration activities to validate a technology’s high level of readiness will be reflected in the evaluation.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The developed innovative product functionalities should lead to a remarkable impact for both producers and users, in the following terms:
Cost increase pertaining to those functionalities integrated into products should be below 10% with respect to the cost of conventional products .
The improvement in the product performance should be above 20% in the targeted functionalities such as: surface friction (increase or decrease), wear resistance, surface energy, corrosion and thermal resistance, hardness, self-cleaning properties, conductivity, anti-fouling, catalytic properties, etc. Besides, the improvement can also consist in obtaining tailored optical properties including for aesthetic or functional purposes.
Strengthened global position of European manufacturing industry through the intensive implementation of innovative and unconventional technologies along the European manufacturing value chain.

The competitiveness of European manufacturing depends on producing differentiated and high added value products in an efficient and sustainable manner, with reduced production costs, increased product quality and minimised time to market. Multi-material products have the advantage of putting the right material in the right place to satisfy all the expected requirements, which is particularly relevant when high cost or critical materials are involved. The aim of this topic is to integrate unconventional manufacturing technologies within a specific set (water jet, ultrasonic and micro-wave, electron beam welding and/or electro discharge machining, laser and photopolymerisation) into a manufacturing system to make multi-material products composed of high cost or critical materials with a prolonged service life. These innovative manufacturing concepts and technologies can help European industry to face the challenge of improving resource efficiency and sustainability.
The integration of the above-mentioned unconventional manufacturing technologies into the process chain may be complemented with processes such as thermal treatment, in-process inspection and control, stress-relieving, micro-structural improvements, machining and joining. Successful integration will help to achieve a breakthrough in innovative manufacturing approaches for multi-material products. The major challenge lies in reinforcing the integration of these unconventional processes into manufacturing systems for multi-material products and subsequently implementing them throughout the European manufacturing sector, as well as ensuring that the disassembly of the materials is possible to enable re-use and recycling.
Scope:
The proposal should use one or more of the following unconventional manufacturing technologies (water jet, ultrasonic and micro-wave, electron beam welding and/or electro discharge machining, laser and photopolymerisation) to create new manufacturing systems for multi-material products. To tackle this major challenge successfully, research will need to cover all of the following areas:
innovative process chains for high cost or critical multi-material products based on unconventional technologies, integrated if appropriate with more conventional manufacturing techniques such as machining and joining;
manufacturing processes capable of generating the features and geometries required for multi-material products as well as integrating additional improvements such as thermal treatment, stress relieving, surface hardening, corrosion resistance or micro-structural improvements;
new flexible machinery concepts and components to allow the integration of unconventional technologies and processes into industrial manufacturing systems able to handle a range of material combinations and products;

Rapid developments in micro-/nano-technologies require complex business models that respond to volatile markets in demand for faster product delivery with an unprecedented yield and quality. High-volume manufacturing is not spared from these requirements, and will in fact need to demonstrate a productivity improvement compared to lab-scale process development and low-volume manufacturing in order to remain commercially competitive.
The process scaling needs to include system-level architectures for metrology and control. This includes data acquisition and control at the levels of the process, the physical handling and the component validation. The in-line metrology and inspection for micro-/nano-production play an important role, together with a common reference system and approach across process chain. The evolution of the control system on the factory floor will also need to show various levels of distributed control in order to cover both batch-to-batch and run-to-run variations with real-time parameter prediction and feedback.
Practical industry solutions for reference metrology at these small dimensions are not readily available. However, whilst efforts are made towards producing reference materials, reliable and fast measurements that allow for control both at the process level and at the higher level of product vehicle or line, are needed. This will enable predictive management of batches, improved quality and speed control, and machine learning enabling fully autonomous control at the level of the process tool.
Scope:
Proposals should include a systems-level strategy for integrating measurement and control throughout the production line for micro-/(nano-)enabled high volume manufacturing. To address this challenge the proposal will need to cover all of the following areas:
Measurement techniques that target highly integrated and functional products at the micro- (and nano-)scale.
Measurement and data acquisition which are non-destructive, i.e. no waste material at the measurement steps, and allow for high throughput scenarios in their respective industrial settings.
Traceability in the measurements back to reference samples (e.g. calibrated standard artefacts and products). Direct contributions to related standards may be a part of the proposal.
Approaches to control at the different levels of factory integration, including process variation, product/component reliability, waste optimisation, yield/output improvements and predictive/preventive corrections to the entire line.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL6.

Despite high automation levels in factories today, humans remain central to manufacturing operations.
In the past, and due to human flexibility, workers were expected to adapt to machine requirements. However, today's machines increasingly allow these roles to be reversed with automation systems becoming ever more adaptable to the capabilities of workers, and work organisation becomes more flexible in terms of time and place. Furthermore, higher levels of product customisation and variable requirements, call for new adaptive human-centred automation approaches, complementing the cognitive capabilities of humans by advanced sensing and the higher precision of machines.
Modern manufacturing system design builds on an optimal and continuous distribution of tasks between humans and machines for higher performance, adaptability and quality.
Scope:
Research activities should address all of the following areas:
Determination of adequate levels of automation for optimal flexibility, agility and competitiveness of highly customised production. Adaptive automation systems should accommodate to the worker's skills and flexibility needs, be it by compensating limitations (e.g. due to age or inexperience) or by taking full advantage of the worker's experience;
Methods and tools for a continuous adaptation of workplaces to the physical, sensorial and cognitive capabilities of workers (especially of older and disabled people in those workplaces) and their socio-economic needs, by taking into consideration ""safety and health at work"" requirements. An adequate methodology to measure ""worker satisfaction"" should be developed and tested. The underlying theoretical framework should in particular involve knowledge from a socio-organisational and psychometrics perspective, including the engagement of workers in the design and adaptation of their workplace to ensure attractiveness;
Exploit technologies such as virtual (and/or augmented) reality to support process and workplace simulations and industrial social networking with rich user experience for knowledge capture and decision support with a strong focus on usability, user acceptance and training.
This topic requires a a user-driven approach through a collaborative effort between social scientists and engineers to (a) come to an adequate understanding of ""worker satisfaction"" and the relevant quantitative indicators, and to (b) introduce the concept of ""usability"" of machines by the worker on the shop floor (particularly concerning elderly, disabled or other target groups with special needs) thus contributing to improving worker safety and health. Age and gender aspects should be taken into account.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Current production shop floors are organised in a fixed combination of sequential automated and manual tasks. Each station, in which one or more tasks are performed, is designed for optimal productivity, and the whole linear sequence of operations is as well optimised for productivity. This paradigm is efficient when production is set to the maximum capacity and the same tasks are repeated in the same way in each cycle. However, this does not scale well to other situations. The complexity and cost of shop floor organisation increases dramatically when it comes to flexible production or logistics, as for example when mixing different product models, and the cost for introducing a new product reference is also very high. Moreover, this model lacks the capacity to react to unexpected technical problems that may arise.
Future shop floors have to endorse flexibility and define networks in which a tight collaboration between humans, machines and robots is key for performance e.g. maintenance operations and changes in product set-up. Therefore the shop floors must be supported by enhanced perception capabilities including the ability to reason over the perceived environment. By using novel embedded cognitive functions, machinery and robots should be able to collaborate as network agents in a realistic semi-structured environment, being able to adapt their behaviour in order to give a response to unforeseen changes or situations. Furthermore, the cognitive capabilities will allow the machinery and robots to evolve from being programmed for a dedicated task to the handling of a multitude of different tasks.
Scope:
Research activities should address at least three of the following areas:
Perception as an integrated cognitive capability, considering collaborative perception (counting not only with on-board sensors, but also with the sensing capabilities available in the whole shop floor), scene understanding, reasoning and acting (active perception).
Perception as a way to create intelligent, dexterous ""universal"" devices for handling or manipulation of products or tools (e.g. handling of soft or shape changing objects, non-task dedicated devices)
Mobility as a key factor for flexibility: machinery and robot systems should not only be able to autonomously navigate in realistic changing scenarios, but also develop the competences to switch from environment level navigation to the accurate positioning required to complete the operations.
Methods and technologies to eliminate physical barriers such as safety guarding or enclosures have already been developed, but lack in inherent safety of the overall system. Cognitive capabilities in order to guarantee safety at all times, including when the system is down (e.g. maintenance, failure) should be researched so that it is possible to open the way to certification.
Adaptation through context awareness and reasoning, aiming at making machinery and robots aware of their surroundings, so that they can perceive and obtain information on the non-programmed and non-expected situations, and adapt their behaviour in order to better handle them, while taking into account safety aspects..
Life-long learning and knowledge sharing tools, reducing to the minimum the initial programming efforts, and reusing the acquired abilities and competences over the existing machines.
Robots and machines should not be considered as individual agents, but will have to be part of an overall interactive network which should be defined and possibly standardised.
Proof of concept in terms of at least one demonstrator should be delivered before the end of the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes, but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs taking into account age and gender aspects, and making a clear case for the safety of the worker under all circumstances.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL6.

The current trend in multi-stage manufacturing is towards more complex, distributed and faster evolving manufacturing facilities. To develop a zero-defect strategy to cope with increasing competition and sustainability related issues, plants should be designed and managed using best practices from emerging key enabling technologies. Manufacturing processes have to be environmental friendly and safe and deliver high quality products adapted to customer requirements, whilst minimising costs.
Within a context of market globalisation, the quality of products has become a key factor for success in manufacturing industry. The growing unpredictability of demand necessitates continuous adjustments in production targets. The increasing interest in sustainable production places a premium on reducing material waste, re-works, rejects and stocks and has led to a demand for the development of zero-defect strategies at system level.
Scope:
Proposals should develop tools and methods for multi-stage manufacturing production with the aim of preventing defect generation and propagation as part of a system-level zero-defect strategy. In this context, integrated production and quality control strategies able to achieve the desired production rate for high quality products need to be developed. They should include both tools to prevent the generation of defects at single stage level and tools to prevent the propagation of defects to downstream stages.
Quality control tools should be supported by distributed on-line data gathering systems, on-line inspection tools, on-line defect management policies (i.e. on-line re-work or workpiece repair), inter-stage information and part flow control strategies and selective inspection policies to achieve higher control of the most critical stages in the system. The final aim is to achieve production system configurations that profitably exploit the quality/productivity trade-off at system level whilst reducing complexity.
Research activities should cover several of the following fields in a multidisciplinary approach:
Methodologies and strategies for integrating production and quality systems into the multi-stage manufacturing process.
Knowledge management tools to facilitate problem resolution, alarm triggering, transferring knowledge from one process or product variant to another and early detection based on lessons learnt, previous alarm activations, trends, etc.
On-line inspection Tools for understanding, monitoring, analysis and real-time fault diagnosis of industrial process operation and product quality.
Development of system-level zero-defect strategies to prevent the generation of defects at single stage level and propagation of defects to downstream stages.
Distributed on-line data gathering systems and on-line defect management policies.
Inter-stage information and part flow control strategies and selective inspection policies.

Manufacturing value chains are distributed and dependent on complex information and material flow requiring new approaches inside and outside the factory both on process and product lifecycle level, from design and engineering over production to maintenance and recycling. Global competition and individualized products make it difficult for manufacturing companies to share information, to produce in collaborative networks across value chains.
Advances are needed in value- and supply-chain centric communication and collaboration schemes that merge machine, human and organizational aspects and enable manufacturing companies, especially SMEs, to respond to ever stricter requirements for being integrated into production process chains. Production architectures need to be more responsive to dynamic market demands which require radical change of production topologies to achieve dynamic production re-configurability, scaling and resource optimization.

Research issues to be addressed include: real-time architectures for interoperability; management of the data deluge from the myriad of monitoring and tracking objects and their fusion with other information sources within the factory and supply chain. Concepts are to be validated through pilots on business and system level to establish new economic collaboration models. Special emphasis will be on ICT security, knowledge protection, and trust in collaborative infrastructures.
Novel architectures for factory automation. Research should explore novel de-centralised, modular, scalable and responsive automation architectures of primarily discrete factory automation systems that support new trends in manufacturing like re-shoring and mass-customisation. Research should encompass the virtualisation of the traditional automation pyramid from sensor-control to enterprise-level and/or methods and models for the synchronization of the digital and real world, as well as integration of novel architectures into existing production systems. Special emphasis is on innovative concepts for shared situational awareness; on self-adjustment of digital models triggered by smart objects, on real-time co-simulation methods; and on handling of large amounts of sensor and process data.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 8 million would allow area i) to be addressed appropriately. For area ii) the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one proposal per area will be selected.
b. Coordination and Support actions
CSAs shall support industrial consensus building both with suppliers and users across Europe, addressing future factory automation systems built on CPS and the IoT; pan-European platform building, and collaboration on manufacturing issues across all relevant PPPs.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address one or more of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success when appropriate
Innovative services, models and practices optimising manufacturing and logistics processes;
Quantified drastic reductions in the effort for integration or reconfiguration of today's hierarchical automation systems through advanced de-centralised or hybrid architectures;
Better and faster reaction to market changes by being able to use holistic global and local optimization algorithms in a collaborative sustainable value chain.

","Innovation action
","20 September 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The elevated complexity and costs of production assets combined with the requirements for high-quality manufactured products necessitate novel design and reliability-based maintenance approaches that are able to provide the required levels of availability, maintainability, quality, safety while considering the system as a whole and throughout the production lifecycle.
Analysis of operational parameters and in-service behaviour, self-learning features and condition prediction mechanisms could contribute to improve smart predictive maintenance systems capable to integrate information from many different sources and of various types, in order to more accurately estimate the process performances and the remaining useful life. That will lead to a more efficient management, reconfiguration and re-use of assets and resources, avoiding false alarms and unforeseen failures which lower operators' confidence in such systems.
Scope:
The aim would be to design optimal maintainability solutions into production systems to improve operating life at maximised performance and reduce costs by carrying out maintenance activities at the most optimised time before failure occurs, thus minimising the degree of intervention required and maximising the system availability.
More trustworthy predictive maintenance and cause-and-effect analysis techniques should be developed to aggregate and interpret data captured from production systems and effectively share the massive amount of information between users. Measurements of a range of parameters at the level of components, machines and production systems should be carried out to provide data for building trend reference models for prediction of equipment condition, to improve physically-based models and to synchronise maintenance with production planning and logistics options. The dependability of the techniques would be demonstrated for a range of components and machines.
While the focus will be on demonstrating the design approaches and maintenance technologies, R&D activities supporting the integration and scale-up are expected as well.
Demonstration activities should address all of the following areas:
Methodologies and tools for improved maintainability and increased operating life of production systems.
Methodologies and tools to schedule maintenance activities together with production activities.
Predictive maintenance solutions, combined with integrated quality-maintenance methods and tools, as well as failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) techniques, that effectively share information among different data sources in a secure way. Exploitation of networks of Smart Objects Technologies is an option.
Versatility, in order to make solutions transferable to different industrial sectors.
The project must include two complex demonstrators in real industrial settings to represent a clear added value.
In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the demonstration effort, the active participation of industrial partners, including SMEs, represents an added value to the activities.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL6.
This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs, as well as for international cooperation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The developed new technologies should lead to a significant impact in the following terms:
10% increased in-service efficiency through reduced failure rates, downtime due to repair, unplanned plant/production system outages and extension of component life.
More widespread adoption of predictive maintenance as a result of the demonstration of more accurate, secure and trustworthy techniques at component, machine and system level
Increased accident mitigation capability.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:
To attract more women to research careers, the Commission launched in 2012 the communication campaign ""Science: it's a girl thing!"", which aims at encouraging 13-18 years old girls to study science. Young people often make career-critical decisions at this age and either orientate towards or away from scientific subjects. Girls tend to drop out of Science, Technology, Engeneering and Mathematics (STEM) for various reasons linked in particular to the social roles they expect or are expected to play as well as the way STEM subjects are taught. In order to better attract and retain female students, science and educational institutions should reconsider their external communication and the way STEM subjects are taught.
Scope:
This topic will support awareness raising activities (workshops, seminars, hands-on activities, etc.) to be carried out with the contribution of gender experts. Activities will involve role models, and will bring together actors such as schools, science museums; research centres, etc, strengthening their interactions. Collaboration with regional/national authorities will be appreciated. Activities shall cover at least 14 countries. Activities will be carried out in the umbrella of the campaign ""Science it's a girl thing"".
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.6 and 0.9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected impact:
In the short term, the action will contribute to change the way science is communicated and increase the participation and interest of girls in STEM.  It will encourage sustainable collaboration among schools, science museums, research centres, on gender equality in science. In the long term, it will contribute towards European Research Area objectives, by increasing the number of female researchers in Europe.  It will also contribute to the Innovation Union objectives by better matching skills to available jobs.

To extend the network of (currently three) centres in the world's most dynamic and innovative countries and regions that connect and support European researchers and entrepreneurs globally, in order to establish their presence in third countries and strengthen the position of Europe as a science, technology and innovation leader.
This call topic builds on the results of the 2016 Call topic ENG-GLOBALLY-09-2016, focusing specifically on innovation.
Scope:
To establish new centres, or networks of centres, in close cooperation with local technology and innovation structures located in third countries and regions.
A maximum of three proposals will be supported including one for India and one for Africa. These centres/networks will engage in activities with a focus depending on the country/region addressed, including activities such as:
Providing services such as incubator co-working space, advice and support directly to European innovators that want to soft-land in the partner country/region and/or to engage in co-creation with local innovators;
Building/linking to an eco-system of stakeholders including early adopters, potential customers, partners etc. in the country/region;
Supporting the transfer and internationalisation of demonstrated technologies and know-how, both to and from the country/region;
Launching local market development programmes to deploy European technology;
Offering mentorship, training and promoting staff exchange to increase capacities of innovators;
Leveraging private and public investors’ resources to sustain the activities of the centre(s).
The proposed work should seek to establish the centres/networks in cooperation with local actors based on a sound business plan that is expected to include clear commitments from multiple funding sources, such as corporates, investors, or local governments making available soft-landing spaces. The business plan and the intended governance (including type of legal entity to be established) shall be presented as part of the proposal. The involvement of European and local incubators or accelerators must be described.
Each proposal shall target one country or region that is an emerging or developing technology or innovation partner; proposals addressing India and all or part of Africa are strongly encouraged without excluding other countries with similar characteristics.
For India, the centre(s) should target mature start-ups and SMEs from both Europe and India and promote matchmaking for adaptation of European technologies and innovative solutions to the Indian context.
For Africa the centre(s) with the network of incubators and accelerators should target at least five sub-Saharan African countries, build on existing local incubators and accelerators, and focus on technology transfer/adaptation (from Europe to Africa or vice-versa), staff exchanges and training.
Consortia are expected to include business development as well as technology expertise in the target country or region and ensure adequate involvement of European stakeholders from existing structures in the addressed countries/regions. Proposals should build on previous work of bilateral and regional international cooperation projects where appropriate.

Priorities of the year, objectives pursued and expected results:
The EU is currently facing a very high influx of refugees and other migrants. In response to this, project grants will be provided aiming to:
- Provide support to Member States/other countries participating in the 3rd Health Programme under particular migratory pressure and to non-governmental organisation working in those Member States to help address the health related issues of arriving migrants while preventing and addressing possible communicable diseases and cross-border health threats, in particular at the designated hotspots and in the areas of reception of refugees and other migrants.
Expected results are a re-enforced response capacity of the Member States under particular migratory pressure to provide the arriving refugees and migrants with initial health assessments and preventive measures, including for children and other vulnerable groups, and thus contributing to combating cross border health threats.
Description of the activities to be funded under a call for proposals:
The activities to be carried out can include all or part of the following:
Address the increasing health threats resulting from population movements by:
- Supporting the establishment of interdisciplinary teams, and the provision of initial health assessment at arrival including a personal health status report to be given to the concerned person, to be shared with health care workers if needed, while considering the particular vulnerability of refugees and other migrants, fully respecting data protection requirements and guaranteeing adequate protection of privacy. This health status report will use a common format, and, if possible, be complemented by an electronic format;
- Supporting the provision of immediate preventive measures, including vaccination where needed with a specific focus on vulnerable groups bearing in mind objectives 1 and 2 of the Health Programme;
- Supporting the application of general hygiene measure;
- Preparing and piloting tailor-made health education and health promotion material;
- Co-operate, coordinate and communicate effectively with the health authorities at local, regional and, where needed, at national level, with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), as well as with other actors engaged in the assistance to refugees in the same geographical setting, taking into consideration the needs expressed by the local authorities and by other organisations operational in the field;
- Take stock of the available tools and measures to support the process of integration of refugees in the Member States' health systems.
All activities should be carried out based on the best evidence available, including existing materials co-funded under FP7, H2020 or the Health Programme.

Deadline date","Objective:
Facilitate trans-national co-operation between European and national initiatives and programmes in support of researchers at risk, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors.
Scope:
Funding will be given to a consortium of organisations with (i) experiences in supporting researchers at risk and (ii) knowledge of related European and national R&I funding programmes. “Researchers at risk” refers to researchers who are either at risk in their origin countries (due to discrimination, persecution, suffering and/or violence), or are seeking refuge out of these reasons or have recently found refuge in Europe.
Special attention will be given to assess the effectiveness of existing measures in European and national R&I programmes and to develop recommendations for policy-makers for effective programmes addressing support to researchers at risk to continue their scientific career in Europe, to find employment in line with their expertise and to support their integration in society in Europe.[1]
The consortium should also build up cooperation with other related networks. It should also increase visibility of these R&I programmes to potential beneficiaries, especially in the non-academic sector. Therefore, particular focus should also be given to training schemes for researchers at risk, in line with the recommendation set out in the Report of the independent High Level Group on maximising the impact of EU Research & Innovation Programmes[2].
This Coordination and Support Action should enable the enablers by facilitating the establishment of sustainable and long-term support networks in Europe beyond its duration in order to be prepared with contacts, guidance and support structures to assist researchers at risk. This Action will support additional collaboration and peer-learning activities of existing networks and organisations.
The following activities should inter alia be envisaged in order to address these goals:
Explore available national and European R&I programmes for researchers at risk and produce targeted guidance materials,
Training and guidance for the application process for the MSCA and other relevant support programmes,
Support for career development for researchers at risk, in the academic and non-academic sector,
Awareness-raising about funding and support opportunities among stakeholders in Europe through workshops and training seminars,
Examine or run test-cases of supporting the integration of researchers at risk in relation to their individual academic backgrounds and their professional careers.
The focus throughout these activities should be on topics specific to MSCA in relation to researchers at risk, in particular scientific excellence, skills and career development, intersectoral mobility, entrepreneurship, equal opportunities and inclusiveness, attractive working conditions, work/life balance, and lead to policy recommendations in this thematic area. It should not duplicate other actions foreseen under Horizon 2020, notably Science4Refugees. Furthermore, the activities should complement actions in Member States and Associated Countries.
In order to ensure maximum inclusiveness, the consortium should gather a group of legal entities from EU Member States and Associated Countries with broad experiences in the field of supporting and integrating researchers at risk in Europe and beyond. Representatives from other entities from EU Member States, Associated Countries or third countries from outside the consortium might however be invited to participate in the CSA's activities (e.g. workshops and conferences) for exchanging best practices.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. The requested duration of support should not exceed three years from the starting date specified in the grant agreement. Nevertheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or duration.
Expected Impact:
An improved, sustainable and professionalised support network for researchers at risk across Europe, facilitating access to Horizon 2020 calls, creating level playing field for applicants to MSCA and other R&I programmes, and raising the average quality of submitted proposals.
A more consistent and sustained level of preparedness for supporting researchers at risk in Europe.

Europe urgently needs more innovators to stay competitive in the coming decades and to spur economic growth. The large number of well-educated women who, for various reasons, including lack of awareness, do not consider entrepreneurship as an option, represents a tremendous untapped pool of innovation.
Awards have a strong potential to drive innovation through the recognition of achievements and the promotion of role models. Therefore, the European Commission created in 2011 a Prize for Women Innovators to increase public awareness of this issue and to encourage women to exploit the commercial and business opportunities and become entrepreneurs.
After the success of the forerunners of the contest in 2011, 2014, 2016 and 2017 the Commission intends to continue its drive to spotlight women innovators and entrepreneurs who have brought outstanding innovations to the market.
The EC wants to highlight the outstanding achievements of women innovators who have (co-) founded a successful company and brought an innovation to market and benefitted from Research and Innovation funding from the public or private sector.
The Commission will award up to three ""EU Prize for Women Innovators"" and one ""Rising Innovator Award"" (female innovators - aged 30 years or under - at the start of their careers) following a European-wide contest.

Specific Challenge: Human health worldwide is increasingly threatened by potential epidemics caused by existing, new and emerging infectious diseases, including those which are resistant to antimicrobial agents. An infectious epidemic can strike anywhere, and at any time globally. In order to save lives, the research response needs to be quick, flexible, comprehensive and global and therefore is beyond the capacity of any single country or even the European Union. Besides being a major threat to human health, such epidemics are a severe burden on the global economy with an impact on competitiveness, growth and jobs.
In response to these challenges a global, multi-funder initiative has been launched, the global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness (GloPID-R). Support is therefore required in building, maintaining and coordinating a global consortium of funding organisations working towards the goal of preparing for a rapid joint global research response to any new outbreak.
Scope: Proposals should provide organisational support to the implementation of GloPID-R, in close collaboration with the European Commission, research funding agencies from Member States and from non-EU countries. Proposals should foresee mapping of GloPID-R relevant networks worldwide.
Proposals should assist the GloPID-R executive committee, notably for the organisation of and reporting on meetings (e.g. ad hoc meetings of working groups), support information exchange among all members of the participating bodies, facilitate the development of a strategic research agenda as well as the coordination among relevant research projects and initiatives.  Proposals should also communicate progress of relevant research funded under Horizon 2020 and by consortium members. Proposals should also include support activities with relevant stakeholders groups and with the public at large (e.g. development of website, communication materials, etc.). Proposals should involve non-EU regions particularly affected by emerging epidemics.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation[1] in research and innovation, the project will contribute to implementing the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness.
Reinforced international cooperation in funding of research in new and emerging infectious diseases aiming to ensure a rapid and effective research response in case of an outbreak.
Effective operations of the global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness consortium (GloPID-R) for 5 years.
Better mutual information and complementarity of funding/research initiatives worldwide in the area of emerging infectious diseases.
Decreased legal, regulatory, and financial barriers to the rapid mounting of a joint global research response

With the burden of this chronic non-communicable disease ever-increasing the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) partnership, of which the Commission is a member, has agreed to launch a call for proposals on the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, with a focus on implementation and intervention research in low- and middle-income countries and in vulnerable populations in high income countries.
Scope: Proposals must focus on type 2 diabetes. Proposals should generate new knowledge on interventions and their implementation for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes in low and middle income countries, and in vulnerable populations in high income countries. Proposals must focus on existing approaches to prevention and control of type 2 diabetes rather than development of new treatments. Proposals may address prevention or treatment of specific complications of type 2 diabetes.
Proposals may focus on a wide range of prevention and/or treatment strategies. This may include programmes addressing (one of or combinations of):
Changes to lifestyle and behaviour resulting from the provision of an environment that supports and promotes better health. This may include community-wide approaches, or other strategies targeting individuals at high risk. For example, population prevention strategies designed to address unhealthy diets and physical inactivity as risk factors for diabetes;
Structural interventions or policies designed to promote improved health outcomes. For example, evaluating the contribution of public policies to diabetes prevention efforts, or monitoring the potential effects of such policies if adopted and implemented;
Delivery of relevant health care and health interventions;
Approaches to implementing accessibility of or adherence to, pharmaceutical, nutritional or other promising or proven interventions.
Proposals should focus on implementation research, to examine what works, for whom and under what contextual circumstances, and how interventions can be adapted and scaled up in ways that are accessible and equitable. Proposals may address prevention or treatment of specific complications of type 2 diabetes. Proposals may also focus on gestational diabetes. Proposals may focus on specific societal groups but a clear justification should be provided as to why the group has been chosen and how the choice will assist the funders in delivering their aim to address health inequities at a local and/or global level. Proposal should focus on implementation research into interventions for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes that are applicable in low resource settings. However, in some settings, proposals may incorporate work to establish baseline data on prevalence of diabetes and its risk factors to evaluate the impact of the intervention. Proposals may include these aspects if they do not duplicate existing evidence available. 
All proposals should:
Focus on research into implementation of prevention and/or treatment strategies derived from existing knowledge and research.
Develop an improved understanding of the key barriers and facilitators at local and national levels that affect the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Include an assessment of equity and gender gaps in diabetes prevention and treatment.
Demonstrate a sound understanding of the local health system context.
Provide evidence of a health economics dimension such as cost effectiveness of the proposed intervention and its scalability.
Describe a clear proposed pathway to embedding the intervention into policy and practice after the study which addresses how:
Local and/or national policy makers will be engaged both at the start of the project as well as the end.
The project outcomes/evidence will be utilised for the scaling up of the intervention on a local, national and international level.
Future scaled-up implementations will fit within the local social, cultural and economic context.
Identify obstacles such as inequities and equity gaps including gender that will be taken into account in the design of an implementation strategy.
Be proposed by a multidisciplinary project team, including local researchers as co-investigators where applicable.
Include local stakeholders such as patient groups or community groups.
Proposals shall not include:
Replication of effectiveness studies and clinical trials testing the efficacy or effectiveness of new or established pharmacological agents (or combination of agents) which have wider effects than those relating to type 2 diabetes.
Aetiological or mechanistic studies of type 2 diabetes.
Phase I or Phase IIa trials.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts
 Expected impact:
Reducing health inequalities and inequities, including gender, in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes in both a local and global context.
Pursuing knowledge translation and exchange approaches that are designed to maximize the public health benefits of research findings within different health contexts.
Providing evidence to inform local health service providers, policy and decision makers on the effective scaling up of the interventions at the local, national and regional levels. For example, applicants could address affordability for users and the financial implications for implementing organisations and funders or might assess scalability to various socio-political contexts.
Contribute to the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases.
Appropriate leveraging of existing programmes and platforms (e.g. research, data, and delivery platforms).
Contribute to the WHO Global Action Plan on NCDs (2013-2020) as proposals will demonstrate alignment with international and/or national commitments to halt the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes.
Contribute to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.
The GACD aims to develop a network of researchers that can enhance cumulative learning across individual projects, and work towards understanding how socio-economic, cultural, geopolitical and policy contexts have influenced results and how findings might be adapted and applied in different settings. The funded researchers should meet annually to discuss their research and share information and data in order to develop approaches to standardise data collection, and wherever feasible to use these standardised approaches in their respective projects

Specific challenge: The Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases will focus its 2015 call for implementation science proposals on lung diseases.
With the burden of this chronic non-communicable disease ever-increasing, the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD[1]), of which the Commission is a member, has agreed to launch a call for proposals on the prevention and treatment of lung diseases, with a focus on intervention research in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and/or in vulnerable populations in high income countries (HIC).
Controlling tobacco consumption and reducing harmful environmental exposures (indoor and outdoor exposures) are among the most important interventions in lung disease[2].
Smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption are considered the single most important cause of preventable morbidity and premature mortality worldwide[3]. Tobacco addiction causes about 5.4 million people death each year, and if resolute and urgent action is not taken by 2030 the epidemic will cause between 8 and 10 million deaths each year, of which over 80% occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Smoking is a major cause of inequality in health between gender, socioeconomic groups and age categories. With nicotine being highly addictive, it is important to prevent young people from taking up tobacco use. 70% of the smokers start before the age of 18 and 94% before the age of 25 years.
The precise health risk that environment exposure poses to lung diseases is not well established because of the difficulty to assess the prevalence linked to the amount of exposure. Risk assessment is further complicated by socioeconomic, age and genetic factors.
Scope: Proposals must focus on lung diseases and they must have an implementation science focus. They must address what works, for whom, under what contextual circumstances and are the intervention(s) adaptable and scalable in ways that are accessible and equitable. Proposals should generate new knowledge on interventions and their implementation for the prevention and treatment of lung diseases in LMIC, and/or in vulnerable populations in HIC[4]. Proposals must focus on existing approaches to prevention and control of lung diseases or develop treatments at lower costs. They should demonstrate a sound understanding of the local health system context as well as the global cross-sectorial context.
All proposals should:
Focus on research into implementation of prevention and/or treatment strategies derived from existing knowledge and research.
Develop an improved understanding of the key barriers and facilitators at local and national levels that affect the prevention and treatment of lung diseases.
Provide evidence of a health economics dimension such as cost effectiveness of the proposed intervention and its scalability.
Describe a clear proposed pathway to embedding the intervention into policy and practice after the study which addresses how:
−        Local and/or national policy makers will be engaged both at the start of the project as well as the end.
−        The project outcomes/evidence will be utilised for the scaling up of the intervention on a local, national and international level.
−        Future scaled-up implementations will fit within the local social, cultural and economic context.
−        Identify obstacles such as inequities and equity gaps including gender that will be taken into account in the design of an implementation strategy.
Include local stakeholders such as patient groups or community groups.
Proposals may focus on a wide range of prevention and/or treatment strategies. This may include programmes addressing (one of or combinations of):
Structural interventions or policies designed to promote improved health outcomes. For example, evaluating the contribution of public policies to lung diseases prevention efforts, or monitoring the potential effects of such policies if adopted and implemented;
Approaches to implementing accessibility of or adherence to, pharmaceutical, or other promising or proven interventions;
Study the feasibility and effectiveness of low-cost and integrated prevention and management approaches of lung diseases;
Study populations exposed to tobacco products[5], in particular assessing the behaviour of populations consuming those products that may contribute to: (i) developing addiction, (ii) shifting normative attitudes to smoking and tobacco control, and (iii) establishing overall impact of those tobacco products at both individual and population levels;
Study populations exposed to electronic cigarettes[6], in particular assessing (i) the behaviour of populations consuming these products that may result in developing addiction to nicotine; (ii) the overall public health impact of electronic cigarettes over long term and address questions to what extent these products are an initiation product to/cessation product from nicotine addiction and tobacco consumption.
Assess current policy for prevention (e.g. design/presentation, fiscal, tax and information policy related to tobacco) as well as options to support smoking cessation (including pharmacotherapy, electronic cigarettes, intervention financing mechanisms), taking into account the context in which they are implemented. Research on new low cost formulations of proven effective therapies will also be supported;
Optimize tobacco cessation interventions, identify the most cost-effective interventions for resource-constrained settings and integrate smoking cessation into health systems;
Evaluate the impact of interventions for reducing environmental exposure and mitigating their effects in indoor and outdoor air pollution;
Investigate the interaction between the individual and the environment to better define at-risk populations and identify biomarkers for lung diseases associated with environmental exposure;
Propose intervention(s) to modify indoor and outdoor exposures and assess the subsequent health outcome.
The GACD aims to develop a network of researchers that can enhance cumulative learning across individual projects, and work towards understanding how socio-economic, cultural, geopolitical and policy contexts have influenced results and how findings might be adapted and applied in different settings. The funded researchers should meet annually to discuss their research and share information and data in order to develop approaches to standardise data collection, and wherever feasible to use these standardised approaches in their respective projects.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
To demonstrate the link between the intervention(s) and health outcome in lung diseases;
To reduce health inequalities and inequities, including gender, in the prevention and treatment of lung diseases in both a local and global context;
To pursue knowledge translation and exchange approaches that are designed to maximize the public health benefits of research findings within different health contexts;
To provide evidence to inform local health service providers, policy and decision makers on the effective scaling up of the interventions at the local, national and regional levels. For example, applicants could address affordability for users and the financial implications for implementing organisations and funders or might assess scalability to various socio-political contexts;
Appropriate leveraging of existing programmes and platforms (e.g. research, data, and delivery platforms);
To improve quality controls and safety (including toxicity profile) of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes;
To develop the necessary knowledge basis for further coordination of regulatory aspects related to tobacco products and electronic cigarettes;
To characterise behavioural group specificity in successful intervention(s) in order to tailor preventive and control interventions;
To develop lower cost therapeutic option for smoking cessation that are cost effective in LMIC;
To contribute to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals[7].

Specific challenge: Maximising scarce resources and coordinating research efforts are key elements for success in the area of rare diseases, characterised by scattered knowledge and relatively small patient populations. Transnational cooperation and coordination to pool resources and avoid duplication of efforts, while developing common standards and research priorities, is therefore essential. The International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) was launched in 2011 to strengthen international collaboration in the area with the aim of delivering 200 new therapies for rare diseases and means to diagnose most of them by the year 2020[1].

Specific challenge: Antibiotic resistance is a global problem. It is considered by the World Health Organization as one of the three greatest threats to human health for the next decades. In Europe, however, research on the resistance to antibiotics and on how to make sustainable use of antibiotics is fragmented. In addition, few countries have specific programs dedicated to this field of research.
 The Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) on Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) provides an excellent opportunity for joint research of the EU Member States addressing the emerging problem of antibiotic resistance in human and veterinary medicine. Indeed, the currently funded research projects in national or trans-national programs are usually the result of calls initiated within other research areas rather than from research programmes specifically focusing on AMR. Consequently, the variable and non-permanent resources of trans-national organisations and individual countries are insufficient to provide the long-term funding opportunities that are required to solve the major research questions concerning AMR. In addition, research activities on AMR are not harmonised between countries; which may lead to duplications in the research being performed in different countries.
 The 19 participating countries of the AMR JPI aim to accomplish the coordination of European research on AMR in close collaboration with the funding instruments of the EU; specifically Horizon 2020, Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and the ERA-NET Infect-ERA.
 This will create the necessary critical mass and develop the most advanced scientific approaches to tackle the problem of AMR, reversing its increasing trend, in the way forward defined by the Strategic Research Agenda which is to be adopted by the JPIAMR in early 2014.
 This transnational cooperation will enhance the societal impact that is required in this area, promoting knowledge dissemination among multiple sectors of the society that are implicated – patients, clinical, veterinarians, pharmacists, food producers and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.
 Scope: Proposals should be central to the effective coordination of joint research funding in the area of AMR. Proposals should coordinate national and regional programmes in order to implement the Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) of the JPI AMR through a transnational call with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties.
 This transnational call topic should be in line with one or more of the priority areas of the SRA and is expected to lead to a lower, smarter use of antibiotics in veterinary and clinical settings and to a significant reduction of the risk that antibiotic-resistance poses to public health.
 Proposal should implement other joint activities including collaborative actions with the World Health Organisation or the pharmaceutical industry (among others) as well as additional joint international calls without EU co-funding (e.g. with Canada).
 The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a minimum of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact:
 •                    Leverage transnational research by funding research proposals on a topic identified by the JPIAMR from its Strategic Research Agenda and implementation plan.
•                    Stimulate and increase research into the causes, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infections caused by resistant organisms and force the EU added value in the area of antibiotics.
•                    Enhancement and/or better exploitation of current research funding activities at national, European and international level.
•                    Catalysing and strengthening the development of national and trans-national strategies in JPI AMR countries.
•                    Establishment and alignment of existing national strategies.
•                    Increased visibility, also at a political level, of the burden of AMR and the benefits of research to economy and society.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The EU Joint Programming Initiative on Neurodegenerative Diseases Research, in particular Alzheimer's (JPND), was established in 2009 as the pilot of the Member State-led Joint Programming Initiatives and enables the participating EU Member States to work together on the challenge of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. JPND allows the establishment, alignment and building on of national research programmes to increase the effectiveness and impact of research efforts.
The JPND Research Strategy must now be scaled-up and synergies must be established with Horizon 2020 as was also called for by the Council in its conclusions of 8 December 2011[1]. The scope of the Research Strategy requires coordinated action not only amongst the participating countries but also with the EC for producing the necessary critical mass. Moreover, for achieving the highest impact possible, there is the need for less fragmentation, better coordination and alignment amongst the countries participating in the JPND.
Scope: Proposals should coordinate national and regional programmes for research in the area of neurodegenerative diseases research by implementing a transnational call with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties, with a view to scale-up the implementation of the JPND Research Strategy. This call shall be defined as follows: ‘Identification of genetic, epigenetic and environmental risk and protective factors for neurodegenerative diseases’, and/or of the ‘Longitudinal cohorts in neurodegenerative disease research’ and/or of the ‘Advanced experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases’.
Proposals should also promote the strategic alignment of research activities related to neurodegenerative diseases across Europe, such as developing and aligning national research plans and strategies, making data bases more accessible and interoperable, harmonisation of measurements and methodologies, networking of already existing structures and studies, training etc.
Proposals should demonstrate the expected impact on national and transnational programmes as well as the leverage effect on European research and competitiveness, and should plan the development of key indicators for supporting this.
Proposal should implement other joint activities including training and additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a minimum of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact:
Funding of research proposals on a topic identified by the JPND implementation plan or by their action groups, which needs to be addressed at European level and which is complementary to topics of the EC work programmes;
Leverage transnational excellent research with EU-added value in the area of neurodegenerative diseases;
Increased commitment of participating countries to the implementation of the JPND SRA;
Establishment and alignment of national and regional plans and initiatives on neurodegenerative diseases;
Strengthened exchange and better interoperability between existing European infrastructures and data bases;
Enhancement and/or better exploitation of national or EC-supported activities.

In this context ""Upper Respiratory Tract Infections"" include pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis as well as bronchitis.
The objectives pursued by this inducement prize are:
−             To reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics in case of viral upper respiratory tract infections.
−             To reduce costs and side effects linked to the use of antibiotics;
−             To delay the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms;
−             To enable health-care providers to take early decisions in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (rapid initiation and cessation of treatment) and to facilitate the health care provider’s decision not to prescribe antibiotics in case of viral infections and to facilitate patients’ acceptance of not taking antibiotics for viral infections;
−             To tackle the widespread and significant health care issue of respiratory infections; an ageing population, antibiotic resistance and increasing health care costs make this a particularly challenging problem.
Expected results: development of a rapid point-of-care test that will reduce the use of antibiotics in a safe way in patients with upper respiratory tract infections.

Effective security audits of open source hardware, embedded software and other security-relevant aspects of connected devices.
Effective mechanisms for inventory management, detection of insecure components and decommissioning.
Methods for secure authentication and secure communication for connected devices in restricted environments such as IoT devices
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.
Scope:
The quality of hardware and software, notably open source, for IoT and connected devices is improving. However, the restricted environment of many IoT devices does not allow the deployment of more complex protection schemes (e.g. Trusted Platform Modules, Sandboxing applications in managed memory partitions) and similar approaches that often rely on operating system (OS) support to ensure cybersecurity. Open Source designs are frequently used in IoT technology and become more reliable and efficient with the number of developers that deploy them. The management of this large collaborative development environment that Open Source represents is a real cybersecurity challenge.
The aim is to support European trustworthy platforms by methods, tools and technologies that foster a stronger Cybersecurity, which can serve in a variety of connected devices. The proposed action should integrate formal security models and verified and scalable cryptography that can be used in future key system components (operating systems,…).
Proposals should cover one or more of these research activities:
development of verifiable implementations of cryptographic solutions, authentication schemes, and, as relevant, software libraries that implement them securely in operating systems;
develop mechanisms to mitigate hardware-related security vulnerabilities
development of security auditing for connected devices;
development and advancing of security testing in restricted environments;
development and advancing of verification methods for secure firmware updates and secure software patching in connected devices;
development of multi-factor authentication hardware and software solutions.
development of the security upgrading of the connected devices within the life cycle (bootstrapping, commissioning, operational, upgrade etc.)

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Reinforced cybersecurity using AI technological components and tools in line with relevant EU policy, legal and ethical requirements.
Increased knowledge about how an attacker might use AI technology in order to attack IT systems.
Digital processes, products and systems resilient against AI-powered cyberattacks
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.
Scope:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is present in almost every application area where massive data are involved. Understanding the implications and possible side effects for cybersecurity however requires deep analysis, including further research and innovation. On the one hand, AI can be used to improve response and resilience such us for the early detection of threats and other malicious activities with the aim to more accurately identify, prevent and stop attacks. On the other hand, attackers are increasingly powering their tools by using AI or by manipulating AI systems (including the AI systems used to reinforce cybersecurity).
The proposed actions should develop AI-based methods and tools in order to address the following interrelated capabilities: (i) improve systems robustness (i.e. the ability of a system to maintain its initial stable configuration even when it processes erroneous inputs, thanks to self-testing and self-healing); (ii) improve systems resilience (i.e. the ability of a system to resist and tolerate an attack, anticipate, cope and evolve by facilitating threat and anomaly detection and allowing security analysts to retrieve information about cyber threats); (iii) improve systems response (i.e. the capacity of a system to respond autonomously to attacks, thanks to identifying vulnerabilities in other machines and operate strategically by deciding which vulnerability to attack and at which point, and by deceiving attackers; and to (iv) counter the ways AI can be used for attacking. Advanced AI-based solutions, including machine learning tools, as well as defensive mechanisms to ensure data integrity should also be included in the proposed actions. Proposals should strive to ultimately facilitate the work of relevant cybersecurity experts (e.g. by reducing the workloads of security operators).
Regarding the manifold links among AI and cybersecurity, privacy and personal data protection, applicants should demonstrate how their proposed solutions comply with and support the EU policy actions and guidelines relevant to AI (e.g. Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI[1], the AI Whitepaper[2], EU Security Strategy[3] and the Data Strategy[4]). Proposals should foresee activities to collaborate with projects stemming from relevant topics included in the Cluster 4 “Digital, Industry and Space” of Horizon Europe. Generally, proposals should also build on the outcomes of and/or foresee actions to collaborate with other relevant projects (e.g. funded under Horizon 2020, Digital Europe Programme or Horizon Europe).
Proposals should strive to use, and contribute to, European relevant data pools (including federations of national and/or regional ones to render their proposed solutions more effective. To this end, applicants should crucially strive to ensure data quality and homogeneity of merged/federated data. Applicants should also identify and document relevant trade-offs between effectiveness of AI and fundamental rights (such as personal data protection).

Projects are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Improved scalable and reliable privacy-preserving technologies for federated processing of personal data and their integration in real-world systems
More user-friendly solutions for privacy-preserving processing of federated personal data registries by researchers
Improving privacy-preserving technologies for cyber threat intelligence and data sharing solution
Contribution to promotion of GDPR compliant European data spaces for digital services and research (in synergy with topic DATA-01-2021 of Horizon Europe Cluster 4)
Strengthened European ecosystem of open source developers and researchers of privacy-preserving solutions
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact.
Scope:
Using big data for digital services and scientific research brings about new opportunities and challenges. For example, machine learning methods process medical and behavioural data for finding causes and explanations for diseases or health risks. However, a large amount of this data is personal data. Leakage or abuse of this kind of data and potential privacy infringement (e.g. attribute disclosure or membership inference) risks are a cybersecurity threat to individuals, society and economy and an impediment for further developing data spaces involving personal data. Vice versa, adequate protection of this data according to the GDPR can also prevent its full utilization for society. Advanced privacy-preserving computation techniques such as homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, and differential privacy are being researched and have proven promising to address these challenges. However, further research is required to ensure their applicability in real-world use case scenarios. For example, fully homomorphic encryption is not practically applicable in many cases and secure multi-party computation often imposes special infrastructural requirements.
Building on research and innovation in the area of privacy-preserving computation, proposals should address scalability and reliability of privacy-preserving technologies in realistic problem areas and take integration with existing infrastructures and traditional security measures (e.g. access control) into account. They should respond to users’ needs, e.g. for research and digital services in access and data management for citizens geared towards their own profiles (incl. dynamic personalised recommendations for improved cybersecurity) or in personalised medicine, taking into account the gender dimension where relevant. They should further address the legacy variation in personal data types and data models across different organisations in the same business sector and/or across different potential application sectors. A proposed solution should include validation or piloting of privacy-preserving computation in realistic federated data infrastructures and more specifically European data spaces involving personal data (e.g. the EU heath data space). It should be guided by the EU’s high standards concerning the right to privacy, protection of personal data, and the protection of fundamental rights in the digital age. It should ensure, by-design, compliance with data regulations and specifically the GDPR. Wherever possible, solutions should be developed as open source software.
Consortia should bring together interdisciplinary expertise and capacity covering the supply and the demand side, i.e. industry, service providers and end-users. Participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged. Legal expertise should also be incorporated to assess and ensure compliance of the technical project results with data regulations and the GDPR.

Europe needs to strengthen its capacity to produce materials and chemicals in a sustainable and competitive way. Moreover, the recent crisis has shown the importance for Europe’s chemical and material industry to increase its flexibility, and to adapt quickly its production capacities to the changing supply needs[1].
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Foster global competitiveness of EU companies. Helping Europe to overcome its reliance on imports of chemicals, in particular for essential products, while boosting Europe's economic and social recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis;
Deliver new modular production concepts for the chemical industry (e.g. base ingredients for pharmaceutical or other essential societal products) that would significantly decrease process development time through the standardisation, modularisation and application of novel process intensification technologies;
Produce highly efficient, flexible, and stand-alone production units that could be shipped to places where the need would be the highest;
Enable decentralised and continuous processing of high added value chemicals and materials;
Improve flexibility in products customisation with a faster response to supply chain/customer demands, creating opportunities of new business models enabled by digital technologies.
Achieve a significant impact on reducing production costs, design efforts time-to market and logistic efforts.
Scope:
Building on the experience gained from flexible production units[2] it would be possible to equip base chemicals production containers with modular and standardised units capable to facilitate a swift shift in the final production outcome. The focus on the proposals under this topic should thus be the development of adaptable chemical plants with flexible outputs.
Innovation actions within this topic may include:
Improving flexibility and modularity of the equipment;
Adaptation of process analytical technologies for modular production, to support process control, automation, predictive maintenance and process coordination;
Smart equipment in intensified up and downstream processing;
Increasing safety of fully automatic operations and reducing occupational health related risks;
Enabling decentralised and continuous processing of high added value chemicals and materials;
Standardisation of modular production concepts, including international standards.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Efficiency and productivity gains in design and construction processes;
Fewer errors in planning, design and construction processes;
Automated, faster, more accurate and more efficient permitting and compliance for construction works (e.g. regulatory, health and safety, performance);
Improved build quality and resource efficiency in construction, in line with the aims of the New European Bauhaus initiative.[1]
Scope:
There is a need to develop, connect and align new technologies and digital tools for construction, including improved and automated methods of designing, building and authorising construction works. The manual processing and delivery of administrative, legal and regulatory information such as planning and construction permits, and related compliance processes, are complicated and lengthy procedures. This leads to delays and ambiguity in the construction process, as well as errors, extra costs, waste and inefficiency.
Information generated or imported into digital models during early design phases can potentially streamline the application and granting of digital administrative permits. This will in turn facilitate informed decision making including compliance checks later in the design and construction process and throughout the life cycle of the built asset.
Proposals should:
Develop and demonstrate novel ways of digitalising permitting and compliance processes for construction works;
Demonstrate new tools and solutions for the storing, processing, analysis and retrieval of administrative and regulatory information related to construction works; and facilitate stakeholders to consult the current status of the process at all times. The new solutions should make use of neutral data formats, addressing rule interpretation and machine-readable information, and supporting analysis and exploitation of relevant digitalised acts, regulations, requirements and standards;
Ensure that the new solutions are interoperable and integrated, where relevant, with other relevant tools, databases and processes. These can include Building Information Models (BIM), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), public registries, Life Cycle Analysis data, digital twins including those of greater scale (e.g. city, regional or national level) with support for enabling Augmented Reality/Virtual reality and additional novel features, 3D cadastre, digital building logbooks, and models of larger scale of the built environment, including those that are handled by public authorities. Proposals should ensure that spatial information, where relevant, aligns with the aims of the INSPIRE Directive[2];
Ensure that the new solutions developed can handle a wide variety of relevant data, for example spatial and location data relating to the buildings or infrastructure and their context; urban height limits and setbacks; visual corridors or protected views; environmental information such as flood risk models and protected trees; cultural heritage rules and protections; utilities and services including energy, water and telecoms infrastructure;
Develop solutions that harness the potential of digitalisation to accelerate processes and improve productivity, open up new methods of working and business models. For example, proposals should make use of disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, algorithm based checks, Human Aided Design and Compliance;
Address potential barriers to the use of digital building permits and compliance checks including knowledge gaps, technology deployment, standards, and the regulatory and policy context;
Take into account the wide range of actors involved in applying for, receiving and using permits and the related compliance (e.g. design, engineering and other construction professionals, researchers, industry especially SMEs, and public authorities), taking into consideration questions of accessibility, inclusivity including gender issues, and user acceptance;
Take into account the international contexts and developments in construction-related data including BIM and GIS but also the capacities and opportunities presented in different parts of Europe. Proposals should therefore build on previous research, such as the outputs of the DigiPLACE project[3];
Address the potential for upskilling and re-skilling of the construction value chain as a result of the innovation;
Contribute to an EU-wide framework for the digitalisation and automation of machine readable permits and compliance checks for construction works, including by collaborating with similar projects including those funded under this call;
Develop technical guidelines and semantic models applicable to different EU countries.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.
Finally, proposals should provide contributions to relevant standards and seek to ensure synergies with the Horizon Europe ‘Built4People’ co-programmed Partnership. Proposals may address any or all types of buildings and infrastructure as appropriate.

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Significant improvement in productivity of construction and renovation processes for energy-efficient buildings, supporting an increase in scale in the renovation process and streamlining resource efficient nearly zero-energy performance renovation: 30 % waste reduction; improved quality of renovation; at least 30% and towards 50% reduction of on-site construction / renovation work time and 25% costs reduction.
More affordable renovation projects for owners, for all building types but with a specific focus on residential buildings.
Enhanced quality of construction, backed up by post-occupancy evaluations, also supporting a better integration of design and construction activities, streamlining commissioning of buildings, in particular in relation to energy management but also taking into account cross-cutting issues such as accessibility of buildings.
Reduced performance gap between as-built and as-designed (difference between theoretical and measured performance), allowing tracking performance across the life cycle.
Increased trust towards construction and renovation processes, by allowing tracking energy performance across the life-cycle.
Upskilled workforce for industrialised renovation workflows, including automated and robotised construction / renovation, relying on interoperable digital modelling data.
Enhanced safety of the construction workforce and increased acceptance of robotic support for deep renovation.
Innovative, tailored business models for deep renovation allowing increased scale of renovation, generating economies of scale and increasing the potential for attractive and affordable packages for end users including financing.
Tailored access to building information across the life cycle for relevant stakeholders (owners, facility managers, contractors, public authorities).
Integration with distributed renewable energy sources in neighbourhoods and districts, favouring the emergence of related initiatives (e.g. renewable energy communities).
Enhanced synergies of renovation with local resources, e.g. district heating & cooling networks.
Scope:
Several recent projects & calls have focused on prefabrication for deep renovation, but more work is needed to innovate seamless workflows from design through to offsite manufacture, installation, and compliance checking on site, also ensuring due consideration of life cycle performance. There is also a need for more demonstrations across the EU.
Proposals should:
Investigate innovative approaches for industrialised deep renovation, covering the whole workflow from design through to offsite manufacture, installation, compliance checking on site and end strategies for maintenance, operation and end of life.
Make use of innovative processes and technologies, including those delivered by previous research such as design based on circularity principles, prefabricated components and digital tools, that allow to optimise workflows (cost, time, quality, resource use).
Develop significantly improved integrated digital twin solutions that can support all stakeholders involved in the different phases of the construction or renovation processes, i.e. from concept to end-of-use, including design, construction, commissioning, operation (management and maintenance) and, where relevant, change of use.
Demonstrate a seamless integration of the proposed approaches with state-of-the-art digital technologies for construction and renovation (Building Information Modelling, digital twins, etc.).
Investigate the use of robotic systems and automation such as additive manufacturing, on-site automated and robotic systems (e.g. robots for building component assembly), drones and autonomous vehicles (e.g. for surveying, inspection and monitoring), and other types of automated support to augment workers’ capability and safety (e.g. lift robots, exoskeletons) for deep renovation.
Investigate the application of the proposed approaches at neighbourhood- and district-level, with the aim to maximise synergies in renovation work and processes, decrease costs, and to optimise the use of energy-related shared district resources (e.g. heating and cooling networks, renewable energy sources, energy storage facilities, etc.).
Select processes and technologies that have a maximum potential for rapid and broad deployment at European level, with due consideration of the sector’s practices.
Ensure effective involvement of the buildings supply chain, in particular SMEs, as well as of building owners/tenants and other relevant stakeholders.
Where relevant, investigate whether and how the proposed approaches could apply to cultural heritage buildings.
Ensure the proposed approaches allow to reach the highest level of energy performance, also considering other relevant aspects (e.g. life cycle, accessibility), while keeping costs in an attractive range for owners.
Seek to ensure from the design phase that the project is developed with a view to integrate its results/deliverables under a digital building logbook.
Demonstrate, based on well-defined metrics and key performance indicators, that the innovative approaches proposed lead to fewer mistakes, less waste, higher resource efficiency, higher quality in particular with regard to energy performance (reduced performance gap), increased replicability across sites, and other relevant life cycle aspects, enhanced safety of workers and their ability to work alongside robots, and faster construction.
Investigate business models in view of mass deployment and EU-wide impact, seeking to address split of incentives between the owner and tenant of a building as a barrier to investments.
Lead at least 3 large-scale demonstration to assess the proposed approaches for a variety of buildings typologies representative of the European building stock, ensuring the most adequate coverage of climatic conditions.

Enhance the collection and quality of energy and related (e.g. life cycle) data for buildings (including heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, indoor environment quality, all technical equipment, lighting and other appliances) through various sources such as manufacturers’ data, BIM and digital twin models, surveys, digital logbooks, sensors, meters, interfaces (statistical, structured and big data) and Level(s).
Explore approaches to integrate dynamic data from buildings (e.g. coming from sensors) with metering static data (e.g. data spaces, energy performance certificates databases), statistical data, and other types of data (e.g. qualitative feedback from building users).
Ensure the proposed approaches build on interoperability and cloud-based solutions that and allow for seamless collection and use of data from the buildings, systems and subsystems.
Develop new or enhance existing open source data analytics dashboards and prediction tools.
Develop improved tools for digital simulation and digital twinning.
Develop, enhance and integrate existing open data sharing platforms, including where relevant by refining and integrating building data reference architectures and making links with relevant data spaces.
Contribute to the development of open access and standardised European buildings data repositories, also supporting the development of related EU initiatives (e.g. the EU Building Stock Observatory, JRC E3P Roadmap for whole life cycle carbon emissions reduction).
Promote fair data management practices to ensure findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-usability of data.
Seek to ensure from the design phase that the project is developed with a view to integrate its results/deliverables under a digital building logbook.
Demonstrate digital data exchange platforms for building. The solutions should be interoperable and able to interact with grid management platforms.
Demonstrate real use cases with business potential (e.g. smart energy services) valorising high quality building performance data, e.g. to accurately monitor energy consumption and production across different fuels (for instance integrated heating and cooling and hybrid systems) as well as other relevant performance criteria.
Demonstrate that the proposed solutions allow to significantly improve the monitoring of the building stock performance, taking into consideration all relevant aspects (e.g. environmental, economic, and social ones).
Clustering and cooperation with other relevant projects is strongly encouraged; in particular, liaison and synergies with the Horizon Europe Partnerships on ‘People-centric sustainable built environment’ and ‘Driving Urban Transitions’.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Demonstration at full scale (0.5 – 10 MWth) of industrial heat upgrade systems to supply various industrial processes with useful heat in the (sink) temperature range of 90 – 160 °C, extracted from renewable heat sources (e.g. solar thermal), ambient heat or industrial waste heat.
Scaling up and improvement of the economic and technical performances of heat upgrade in order to cover more industrial processes with special attention to integration and adaptation to existing/improved processes.
Demonstration of business models and contractual agreements in the cases of use of the upgraded heat within the industrial plant, in other neighbouring plants or heating networks, as part of the Hubs4circularity approach, identifying also potential regulatory barriers.
Better awareness of the challenges and benefits of heat upgrade in the relevant industrial sectors.
Scope:
This topic aims to satisfy the need for low temperature heat in the relevant industrial sectors, by upgrading lower temperature heat flows, including from renewable heat sources, ambient heat or industrial excess (waste) heat, as a cost-efficient way to improve energy efficiency and reduce the GHG emissions.
Heat upgrade technologies exist, such as for example heat pumps, but their size needs to be scaled-up and their cost needs to be reduced, notably by improving their performances, and their operation needs to be demonstrated in various industrial contexts, in order to ensure their wide deployment. The optional integration of renewable heat sources (e.g. solar thermal) as the input heat flow to be further upgraded, is in scope.
In order to reach this goal all the following development areas need to be covered:
Identify the target industrial processes which would benefit from this technology, as excess (waste) heat sources and as users (heat sinks); assess the impacts of these applications in terms of energy savings and GHG and air pollutant emissions reductions in the EU (and Associated States, if data are available), so as to maximise the impact and coverage of the most promising applications in the subsequent optimisation and demonstration steps. A preliminary analysis of the technico-economic feasibility and impact of the proposed heat upgrade process is expected already in the proposal.
Optimise the heat upgrade system to improve its economic and technical performances in terms of: sink output temperature range (90 to 160°C); temperature increase between sink inlet and sink outlet temperatures; temperature spread between source and sink temperatures; flexibility to source input temperature variations; higher sink thermal power; higher coefficient of performance; bigger size; lower CAPEX (equipment) and operational costs (higher efficiency and lower maintenance).
Development/improvement of design tools at components and system levels.
Integration and long term full-scale demonstration of the system in an industrial application in at least one industrial sector.
Technical and economical life cycle assessment of heat upgrade systems adapted for at least 4 industrial sectors, to demonstrate economic viability, define business cases and exploitation strategy.
Assess the potential impact in CO2 emissions reduction (Mton CO2/a) and energy savings (TWh/a) in EU27 and (if data are available) in the Associated States, of using heat upgrade systems in the relevant industrial sectors, taking into account not only the thermal energy temperature and volumes needed by the relevant sectors but also the temperature lift capabilities, and the availability of ambient or waste heat sources. The supply temperature ranges to be considered for the impact assessment are: <100°C, 100-200°C and >200°C. Evaluate the potential impact at global level by extrapolation. In case several projects are funded under this call, the results of this assessment should be compared with the other projects and harmonised.
Identify the potential barriers to the deployment of heat upgrade and use due to the local regulatory framework in the EU Member States and Associated Countries.
Disseminate the technical and economic benefits, notably (but not only) to the communities of the relevant Horizon Europe private-public partnerships.
Given the transversal nature of the technology, the potential for transferring the technology to the building heating sector, including district heat networks, should be assessed and disseminated.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Improved systems based on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) to achieve scalability to higher power levels, higher cost effectiveness, wider input temperature ranges, significantly reduced system size, allowing wider take up of heat recovery and its conversion to power from more industrial processes.
Better awareness of the challenges and benefits of systems based on Organic Rankin Cycles.
Scope:
Better use of process excess/waste heat represents a significant source of energy savings for industries. The conversion of excess heat back to electricity would also improve energy efficiency, mitigate the increase of electricity consumption due to industrial electrification and thereby reduce the load on the power grids. This will also facilitate balancing the grid due to intermittent supply of electricity from renewables and so contribute to reduce GHG emissions.
Accounting for the results of previous research[1], proposals are expected to integrate an industrial excess heat-to-power conversion system based on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and demonstrate the system operation in industrial environment at an output power level of at least 2 MW, with improved cost efficiency compared to existing solutions
In order to reach this goal all the following development areas need to be covered:
Optimisation of thermal cycles and mixtures of fluids or additives for different temperature levels of recovered heat and constrained industrial environment, in terms of efficiency and economics (CAPEX, OPEX).
Development/improvement of design tools at components and system levels.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Contribution to the establishment by 2027 of at least two full scale demonstration projects using or potentially using 100% climate neutral fuels in a realistic shipping environment.
Enabling the timely transition to climate-neutral ship operations by facilitating the wider adoption of carbon-neutral alternative fuels at a large scale and for shipping distances of 3000 nm or more.
Supporting the conditions for a timely and efficient uptake of sustainable alternative fuels along the specific supply and usage chain for maritime transport and inland navigation.
*Demonstration of the feasibility to store and use hydrogen based fuels (generally in liquid form) on a medium and large scale (capacities equivalent to +300 tons of conventional marine fuel [HFO, MGO or MDO]) in a realistic environment on-board.
*Demonstration of the use of these fuels in high power applications with long autonomy.
*Demonstration of the applicability, in particular with respect to short sea shipping, IWT vessels, and the stricter environmental expectations for passenger ships.
*Development of pertinent technical rules.
Scope:
Commercial shipping, including deep sea shipping (intercontinental maritime transport), short sea shipping (services between European destinations), and other ship operations with high power demand (which may include also certain aspects in IWT), requires the storage of large amounts of energy with conventional fuel capacities from hundreds to thousands of tons allowing operational autonomy up to several months. The use of sustainable alternative fuels at scale embracing a number fuel options needs to be studied and solutions developed for a wide range of applications.
Sustainable hydrogen, ammonia and other hydrogen derived fuels are potentially promising alternative fuels to make shipping fully climate neutral and independent of fossil fuels. Only very limited experience with the use of ammonia and hydrogen as fuel in a maritime environment exists today.
Hydrogen and ammonia are particularly challenging in terms of on-board storage capacities, storage methods, safe handling, space constraints and the structural integration of tanks, and their subsequent use in high power propulsion systems.
The aim is to develop large and very large storage solutions for hydrogen and ammonia (e.g. compressed H2, liquid H2, LOHC, hydrides, ammonia derived compounds) and their integration on-board. Whilst a certain fuel neutrality is sought a rigorous preselection of the most suitable type and form of fuels is required in order to come to a realistic demonstration environment as early as possible.
Research and innovation is needed with respect to the efficient and safe on-board storage and use under real shipping conditions, taking into account aspects such as pressure, temperature, explosion risk and toxicity. These aspects have to be investigated considering all the relevant issues related to the maritime environment such as structural response of the ship, ship motions and related effects (e.g. sloshing, resonance), corrosion, etc.. In order to facilitate the wide-spread use of these clean fuels, solutions should be modular with the possibility of upscaling, and pertinent technical rules should be developed.
Solutions are not necessarily limited to maritime freight transport if it can be shown that these fuels can be used economically and efficiently at the specific scale of passenger services (ferries) and IWT. This may imply different regulatory constraints and infrastructure (bunkering) situations which have to be taken into account.
Projects will address both the storage of hydrogen and ammonia at capacities exceeding the equivalent of 300 tons of conventional marine fuels in order to show the use in a realistic environment with practical range and autonomy, although the fuel capacity may be adapted to the requirements of different ship types in a first stage of development. The scope extends to the design, testing and overall assessment of on-board systems for these fuels, developing concepts and testing them at lab scale with a robust perspective of scaling up to achieve the levels needed for operational commercial vessels. The structural integration of fuel and energy systems on-board, related safety issues, supporting standards development, and the minimisation of storage volumes and distributions systems towards the energy converters will be addressed. This also needs to take into account bunkering situations as part of the fuel handling on-board.
Transport of such fuels in dedicated carriers does not fall within the scope of this topic.
