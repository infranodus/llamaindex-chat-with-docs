Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Establishing the basis for achieving TRL 8 in on-board use of high power fuel cells by 2030.
*Feasibility and technical demonstration of the use of high-power fuel cells in co-generation and/or combined cycle mode in waterborne transport.
*Proof of scaling up, to a target of significantly above 3 MW power output, of fuel cell installations for all shipping applications, including main propulsion of a short sea shipping or inland navigation vessel.
*In case of a fuel cell using fossil fuel as input proof of significant efficiency gains (at least 20%) in a realistic environment compared to the conventional use of the fuels (e.g. within an ICE) with consequent reduction in GHG emissions.
*Demonstration of the exploitation on-board of waste thermal energy produced by high temperature fuel cells in ship-specific applications (e.g. hot water, steam production, HVAC, etc.) for potential mass-market application.
*Showing a realistic pathway to the wider use of fuel cell technology in waterborne transport including the assessment of the maturity and resulting mid-term potential of various fuel cell systems. This may include an initial focus on lower power propulsion applications in inland navigation where power reserves for adverse sailing conditions are less relevant.
Scope:
The use of fuel cells (FC) for waterborne applications is becoming increasingly relevant as stack power increases and the problem of the storage of un-regulated alternative fuels is solved. Demonstrating and upscaling this technology will lead to initial and earlier applications in IWT and short sea shipping vessels, as well as to complementary power generation on-board ships with high power demand, whilst also setting foundations towards deployment within even larger scale long distance applications.
Whilst previous projects have addressed applicability of mainly smaller fuel cell systems on-board, the full integration of very high power fuel cells on-board large ships represents a major challenge.
The total efficiency of high temperature FCs, using a variety of fuels, can be substantially increased through their use within a combined cycle, recovering secondary heat or using them in combination with secondary combustion systems. Whilst such installations are operating on land with substantial improvements in energy efficiency compared to an internal combustion engine, a fully integrated dual cycle multi-MW FC system has yet to be achieved on-board a ship. Regardless of the fuel used efficiency improvements would be expected to substantially contribute to climate neutrality as well as moving towards high power 100% hydrogen operations.
The aim is to prove the use of high-temperature FCs in a co-generation and combined cycle mode, either on a ship powered uniquely by FCs, or on-board a large ship with high power demand together with other power and thermal energy generation and management systems. Solutions need to address comprehensively the complexity of ship integration, e.g. the balance of plant components, batteries for dynamic loads and waste heat recovery systems.
A demonstrator of a high-temperature system as a large efficient unit will be developed and installed on-board a suitable vessel, and the budget foreseen reflects this ambition. The power of the FC will aim to exceed significantly 3 MW. The system may be run with conventional fossil fuels, with the use of an internal reformer. In this case the system needs to show a significant efficiency gain in terms of reduced GHG emissions compared to the conventional use of the fuel. Overall, the superiority of a FC solution over conventional ICEs should be demonstrated in a comparable arrangement. This may include an IWT application with less power to show the early marketability of the concept and its applicability on a large scale.
Initial target applications are those where the existing regulatory framework facilitates the introduction of a prototype which may depend on the sector of application, the ship type or the fuel used. The project should address the propulsion architecture and/or the electric system, but it shall not address the development of new FCs per se.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The project addressing this “Batteries-2Zero” Joint Call approaches a commonly accepted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of zero-emission road transport solutions, focussing on zero-emission vehicles and their batteries, as one of their central components, as well as other applications of the same types of battery cells (e.g. industrial, stationary applications etc.).
Proposals are expected to provide for coordinated activities on LCA and Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) at vehicle and cell levels, to define and develop a unique and shared approach with common methodologies for both zero-emission vehicles and the battery value chain. The project’s main governance (e.g. Steering Group, Advisory Board) is expected to provide for direct involvement of relevant stakeholders from the automotive and battery sectors, as well as relevant European Commission services. Close cooperation with running EU-funded projects performing LCA in these sectors will also be expected to maximise synergies and reduce duplication of efforts.
The project’s results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
A consensus concept for a harmonised, robust, transparent and real-data based LCA approach and tools (also with consideration for extension to social Life Cycle Assessments, S-LCA), with an emphasis on light-duty and heavy-duty zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) and batteries; enabling the assessment of the sustainability performance and evaluation of optimal designs along the value chain and over the full life-cycle (cradle-to-cradle), also taking into account the need of comparing with conventional solutions.
New, holistic and applicable quantitative tools to drive an approach to the design of ZEV, their components and batteries.
Take into account in particular uptake of the Renewable Energy both for manufacturing processes and for information to the end users.
A harmonised strategy for sustainability by design, describing requirements and specifications of tools for all life-cycle phases required to improve the environmental performance of ZEV and batteries, including their components and sub-systems.
A commonly accepted ontology for a European-wide LCI database for zero emission vehicles and batteries, including all sub-systems and components, and using real data for the present and short-term future, whilst using provisional data, based on trajectories for the reduction of GHG emissions in the Power, Industry and Transport sectors, and use cases, including pre-defined data quality indicators.
Greater environmental sustainability and lower TCO (total cost of ownership) through consistent and frontloaded real-data based assessment of technologies and solutions, with extension to other sectors using the same cells and technologies.
Alignment of on-going harmonisation and standardisation activities relevant for a road transport-specific LCA approach, with emphasis on ZEV and the related battery value chain.
In line with existing or upcoming legislation, and based on guidance from the EC, agree on the common access to the database, including, where this could be necessary for the Member States/Associated Countries to inform their policies.
Increased awareness and acceptance of a European-wide, battery and road transport-specific LCA approach and LCI database.
Scope:
In order to make the best, most informed choices in terms of sustainability, it is of utmost importance for zero emission road transport to have the right tools to assess technologies, non-technical measures and product life cycle processes in a holistic way. In selecting the right technologies for clean and sustainable mobility at a system, vehicle and component level, the ecological footprint and the impact of technologies upon society have to be assessed, based on highly reliable data at an early stage of development and planning in a harmonised and comparable way.
Proposals are expected to address all the following:
Screening, collecting and evaluating existing LCA and S-LCA needs, methodologies, tools datasets and metrics, to identify and overcome knowledge gaps, to identify development needs in current methodologies and tools, as well as to identify the impact reduction potential for ZEV and batteries.
Elaborate a consensus LCA (and S-LCA) approach specific for zero-emission solutions, with an emphasis on light-duty and heavy-duty ZEV and the related battery value chain, suitable for the full life-cycle (cradle-to-cradle) whilst expanding the existing complexity of an environmental LCA to assess and compare the impact of solutions in a holistic way, and reflecting the needs of a resource-efficient circular economy.
Elaborate the baseline for a Europe-wide, commonly accepted, road transport sector LCA approach and LCI database for ZEV and the related battery value chain, based on real data or on provisional data based on trajectories for the reduction of GHG emissions in the Power, Industry and Transport sectors, ensuring openness, accessibility and transparency, implementing the FAIR data principles[1], whilst ensuring applicability to existing technologies.
Taking into account existing and upcoming legislation, under policy guidance of the EC, define access to the database, for purposes of policy makers, including to the authorities of the Member States, where appropriate.
Promote the uptake of Renewables in manufacturing processes and information on renewables to the end users. Harmonise across all stakeholders for methodologies, tools, datasets and metrics as well as for target criteria, to help improve consistency, robustness and transparency, and to address important gaps in transport-specific LCA and LCI, with focus on ZEV and the battery value chain. It is of utmost importance to involve all stakeholders, including the European Commission services, Member States/Associated Countries and standardisation bodies, to ensure the acceptance and succeeding implementation of the LCA approach and LCI database.
Conceptualise the frontloading of a LCA and S-LCA for ZEV and the related battery value chain, at an early stage of development and planning, in a harmonised and comparable way, ensuring the compatibility and comparability with (conventional) alternatives.
Definition of use cases for ZEV and batteries, representative of real-world conditions (e.g. for activity, lifetime, impacts linked to the specific duty-cycle and accounting for user behaviour) and the exemplary characterisation and calculation of impacts from zero-emission vehicle components, through applying the consensus LCA approach, and assessing the variability inherent to key real-world parameters.
Elaborate the potential and outline the transfer of the consensus LCA and S-LCA for other applications, such as fuel cells or stationary battery systems, or markets such as aerospace or maritime.
This work should build upon both recent existing EC- and stakeholder-funded research (such as the eLCAr project and the reports “Circular Economy Perspectives for the Management of Batteries used in Electric Vehicles” and “Determining the environmental impacts of conventional and alternatively fuelled vehicles through LCA”[2], aiming at aligning ongoing activities within this context towards a single LCA approach. Cooperation and exchange of experience and data with running projects performing LCA of batteries and cells is also expected to enrich the results.
The selected projects are invited to participate to BRIDGE[3] activities when considered relevant.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
Deliver transformative technologies that will substantially reduce non-CO2 emissions. The selection of technologies should be compatible with operational procedures and aligned with a potential inclusion of non-CO2 emissions in EU and International aviation market-based measures (e.g. EU Emissions Trading System and ICAO CORSIA) and other potential relevant policy tools (e.g. European Green Deal) and studies[1]. Foster in-flight measurement of non-CO2 emissions.
Deliver transformative technologies for aircraft engines, systems and structures that will maximise the life cycle environmental impact reduction.
Explore new modular aircraft and/or component configurations, optimised for the lowest possible environmental impact and noise footprint at take-off and landing operations, allowing 24/7 operations.
Deliver improved aircraft performance technologies (including engine, hybrid-electric systems, electric & electromechanical systems, integrated H2 storage, management systems, light-weight multi-functional materials and structures and/or morphing capabilities), compatible with aviation climate reduction operational-mitigation strategies, in areas with high climate cost. The selection of technologies should deliver intermediate benefits and bridge the aviation climate neutrality gap towards 2050.
Scope:
The impact of aviation to environment and climate is driven by long-term effects from CO2 emissions and shorter-term ones from non- CO2 emissions (water vapour, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, aerosols, contrails and contrail cirrus). The CO2 effects are well understood and are proportional to the fuel used, while the non-CO2 effects are still insufficiently understood and carry large uncertainties. The total climate impact of aviation has been estimated[2],[3] to two to four times higher than the effect of CO2 emissions alone. R&I activities in Horizon Europe will pay adequate attention to CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, as well as their interdependencies.
Regarding the reduction of full-flight fuel burn and CO2 emissions, the selection of technologies should have a holistic approach to aviation ecosystem, considering aircraft (including engines) technologies, improved air-traffic management solutions (input and synergies with ATM partnership), new fuel options (input and synergies with hydrogen partnership) and operational improvements. Timely alignment with European medium-term industrial roadmaps (beyond 2030) should be established.
Regarding the reduction of aviation non- CO2 emissions, the selection of technologies and operational measures should consider climate optimised flight trajectory planning avoiding sensitive areas, should be compatible with operational procedures and aligned with a potential inclusion of non-CO2 emissions in EU and International aviation market-based measures (e.g. EU Emissions Trading System and ICAO CORSIA).
A potentially high risk in pursuing transformative and disruptive climate neutral aviation technologies is the recent evidence (last decade) from not as flawless as expected entry into service of innovative propulsion and aircraft technologies at large. To mitigate this risk, the R&I actions proposed in this topic should profit and linked with more integrated design and manufacturing advancements that are covered in topic HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-06 (digital transformation).
Overall, this topic aims for new low TRL technologies for reduced life-cycle GHG emissions that will reach TRL4 by 2030, at the latest. The topic has synergies with the EPCA and Integrated ATM partnerships. All activities higher than TRL 3 that address the reduction of GHG aviation emissions, with emphasis on propulsion technologies and their integration, will be dealt in the European Partnership on Clean Aviation (EPCA) and the IATM partnership. The low-TRL technologies in this topic may enable expanding the design envelope with new configurations, more electrified aircraft and engine architectures, more electric systems, more integrated metallic, composite and multifunctional aerostructures, advanced flow control and high-lift aerodynamics as well as advancements in flight control systems. To enable effectively addressing the non-CO2 climate impacts, the topic will also support research to fill gaps in their understanding, and thereby enable addressing these impacts.
Specific Topic Conditions:
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 2-4 by the end of the project – see General Annex B.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Proof of gains in vessel energy performance and operational efficiency through demonstrators that are applicable to maritime transport and/or inland navigation.
Significant reduction in GHG emissions from waterborne transport.
Enabling the timely on-board application of innovative and green solutions for energy transformation that require significantly higher volumes for storage and equipment.
*Deliver at the end of the project deployable energy efficiency solutions (stand alone or in combination, for new builds and for retrofitting) with at least 10% energy savings compared to best available technologies for stand-alone solutions and at least 20% for combined solutions, each on the level of the vessel.
Scope:
The transformation of maritime transport and inland navigation towards climate neutrality can be accelerated through the development and deployment of innovative technologies to improve energy efficiency. The wide-spread adoption of these technologies, in particular for high-power vessels, is crucial. RDI efforts will develop technological solutions for higher efficiency, reducing fuel consumption as well as increasing performance. The overall aim is reducing the vessel’s energy demand, facilitating the transition to sustainable energy sources with lower energy density and potentially higher cost.
Energy efficiency measures may have specific applications linked to new technologies (e.g. alternative fuels, fuel cells, electrification, assisted wind power propulsion) which require significant changes in the on-board energy balance and management.
Projects are expected to address technological solutions for energy efficiency yielding at least 10% reduction in energy consumption compared to best available technologies for similar applications in case of a single measure and at least 20% in case of combined measures.
A wide range of potential solutions may be proposed, including for example: reducing thermal, electrical and propulsive loads, optimisation of on-board energy management systems, design based systemic/holistic approaches and/or the use of active/adaptive technologies.
Digital solutions supporting operational strategies and remote monitoring and control can also be addressed if they are contributing to higher energy efficiency. More and advanced sensors integrated with advanced energy management can form the basis for an increased full life-cycle ship energy efficiency and can feed into digital twin models for the ship and for its sub-systems. Cyber security aspects are expected to be taken into account.
Other potential solutions may include waste heat recovery systems, HVAC improvements, new hull forms, advanced propeller and appendages for enhanced hydrodynamics, reduced hull resistance through air lubrication, new automation and control strategies, new coatings, employing new high performance materials (in particular lightweight materials such as composites) or enhanced production processes.
To maximise the potential for GHG reduction, solutions will be prioritised that are applicable to a wide variety of waterborne operations (and not just selective cases), regarding both maritime and inland navigation.
The technical and operational transferability will be ensured through standardisation and the development of multi-media documentations and training programmes enabling also the long term development of skills.
Activities addressing efficiency gains through the design of internal combustion engines or power generation systems are excluded.
Solutions are expected to be demonstrated in line with the expected TRL but testing within an operational environment would be a benefit.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute concretely to the following expected outcomes as marked (“*”) whilst supporting the overall medium and longer term objectives:
Faster turnaround times of battery electric ships and facilitating the charging of larger on-board batteries.
New business models are developed for electrical ships and their port operations in close cooperation with land side stakeholders.
Increase Europe’s technological lead in fast charging systems for batteries that can be applied to a wide range of vessel types in the medium term.
Increase Europe’s competitive advantage within the electric shipping market supporting jobs and growth.
*At least two full scale demonstrators in two European ports showing the practical use for an end-to-end service between these ports (without a proprietary solution, the system needs to be compatible with charging in other ports as well).
*Demonstration and performance assessment in a realistic environment of fast multi-MW recharging systems, leading to an increase in the technical and economic viability of battery electric shipping.
*Market analysis and feasibility assessment of the more wide-spread deployment of fast high power electrical charging of vessels in European ports (or at certain offshore facilities), including short sea vessels and ferries.
*Demonstrated flexibility regarding different waterborne applications to be served by the same connecting facility.
Scope:
Electrification is an important means to make waterborne transport climate neutral and is already successfully deployed within diesel hybrid ships and fully electric ferries serving shorter distances. The capacity and range of electric vessels are increasing and the cost of batteries are coming down. Due to comparatively high capital costs, business models of electric ships are often founded on high availability, reduced maintenance and fast turnaround.
The provision of high charging powers is often impeded by the lack of availability of high power fast charging and of an adequate electrical supply infrastructure in ports or ferry terminals. The provision of such infrastructure to enable (parallel) multi-MW charging can substantially increase the costs to deploy electric shipping services. Furthermore, charging infrastructures are usually bespoke to a particular electric vessel design. This lack of standardisation further hinders the deployment of electric ships of all types.
Focusing on the ship and shore side interface, R&I will deliver solutions and technology to minimise high power recharging times at port, explore the applicability of charging solutions to a variety of batteries and their usefulness for different ship types. R&I will develop standard interfaces which ensure a seamless integration of different electric ships into conventional port and ferry terminal operations, including their integration with future port and energy infrastructures as they evolve.
Projects will address technologies and solutions for minimising time-to-recharge, by ensuring a recharging system of at least 5 MW capacity. No specific type of connection (either physical or inductive) is preferred.
A high level of charging performance is expected being suitable for new vessels, but solutions should also be adaptable towards existing or refitted vessels.
The following aspects need to be addressed: Ease and required connection time, flexibility regarding power levels and energy transfer whilst minimising impacts on electrical grid infrastructure (cables, switchboards, etc.), addressing potential battery degradation during fast charging, impacts on materials through e.g. corrosion and thermal stress.
Substantial progress beyond the state of the art should be achieved, such as with respect to the Horizon 2020 E-Ferry project. Applicability should be towards a range of vessel types, with larger battery systems and longer autonomy.
It should be explored whether the results can be adapted to a range of particular charging situations where power demand may be lower but the resilience of the system has to be higher and the connection may be more difficult to make. For example, vessels serving wind parks or offshore installations may be able to benefit from direct and distributed charging at the park or installation to enable longer periods of fully electric operation increasing operational efficiency and eliminating excessive transit times.
The energy supply at the port side is not within the scope of this topic. However, projects are expected to consider the minimum requirements for land side grid capacity and technical specifications needed to accompany project outputs.

Ensure that the transitional deployment of LNG fuel does not increase GHG emissions but maximises its potential to contribute to climate neutrality.
Strengthening the European leadership in LNG technologies, allowing for a transitional sustainable use of LNG where it is beneficial.
*At least one full scale demonstrator for full methane slip abatement for a vessel in operation.
*Development and practical demonstration of technical abatement solutions both for retrofitted vessels and new builds, covering a range of operational scenarios.
*Where still necessary and duly justified quantification of methane slip founded upon both in-situ measurements and consolidated pre-existing validated test results in the public domain addressing a range of LNG engine types and load factors, including dynamic loads as, for example, encountered in manoeuvring.
Scope:
Nearly all commercial vessels in operation today have a power generation based on one or more Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). Directive 2014/94/EU on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure defined minimum requirements for the building-up of alternative fuels infrastructure e.g. for natural gas. Currently Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG - methane) is an alternate viable marine fuel deployed to substantially reduce ship-borne pollutant emissions.
However, the impact of LNG on greenhouse gas emissions is strongly influenced by “methane slip”, including the release of unburnt LNG from LNG-fuelled ICEs. This is a problem that is being tackled but not fully solved.
Since methane is a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 on a 20 year basis, the potential release of unburnt methane substantially increases the fuel’s impact on climate change. Whilst it is known that operations under some engine loading conditions and with some engine types can significantly increase methane slip, there is a lack robust data on the scale of the challenge for the existing LNG fleet and for new vessels.
Projects will address the current state of the art and the scatter of emissions between different types of LNG-powered engines. Operational data on methane slip from existing engine installations will be assessed, compared and made available. Activities may include additional measurement campaigns of methane slip where necessary and duly justified, addressing the complexity of different engine types at different load factors (including highly dynamic loads) and operational profiles. Activities will lead to a better understanding of the parameters involved in order to develop the most efficient abatement strategies through ICE improvement and/or post-treatment technologies. Such activities are expected to go significantly beyond existing measuring campaigns and provide distinctively new knowledge. A repetition of measurements already made by producers of large marine engines will not be funded.
Project(s) will develop and demonstrate such strategies and the corresponding technologies for better performing ICEs and/or after treatment systems which virtually eliminate methane slip in all conditions in refitted or newly built vessels. By developing technologies also suitable for retrofitting this action will also have an impact on the existing LNG-powered fleet whilst ensuring that negative impacts on energy efficiency (potentially resulting in higher CO2 emissions) and on the suppression of pollutant emissions (in particular NOx) are avoided.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
A full understanding of clean fuel scenarios for different regions including sensitivity analysis of the different variables, consideration of evolving technologies and their applicability to maritime transport, inland navigation and waterborne operations.
Development of quantified and dynamic techno-economic models for the uptake of sustainable fuels in a variety of waterborne application cases and for a range of regional conditions, clearly identifying uncertainties and parameters to enable technical and economic viability.
Support for the transposition of RDI results into commercial and regulatory reality.
Support to identify the impacts on ports (e.g. bunkering supply and other services, also for IWT, emissions measuring and verification), derived for the defined scenarios for different regions.
Scope:
Other than for short distances, waterborne transport is expected to become climate neutral mainly by the introduction of alternative, sustainable, and carbon-neutral fuels, by massive efficiency improvements and through related technologies for the fuel’s use in propulsion and power generation on-board.
However, the uptake of specific alternative fuels in different European waterborne segments and geographical areas will vary and depend on fuel costs, fuel availability (generation and distribution), national or regional incentives, international co-operation, and many other fixed and dynamic factors. Whilst some studies addressing fuels for maritime transport and/or inland navigation exist, a proper characterisation per segment and per area including sensitivity and variability analysis has not yet been addressed.
Supporting decision making within the ZEWT partnership the CSA will identify and monitor the evolution of different sustainable alternative fuel deployment scenarios, taking into account different types of services, the evolution of sustainable fuel supplies, operational costs and capital expenditure, environmental factors (in particular those affecting coastal and port communities), as well as distribution and infrastructure implications relevant to the sector. Evolving and potential market mechanisms, regulations (e.g. the integration of the maritime transport sector in the ETS, the FuelEU Maritime Directive etc.) and incentives are to be considered. Discussions with sustainable fuel suppliers and facilitating the timely commercial deployment of partnership outcomes to accelerate climate neutrality and emission reduction of shipping are tasks of the CSA.
A model is to be developed considering the wider aspects of waterborne transport (incl. IWT, short and deep sea shipping, high-tech vessels) involving energy and waterborne stakeholders, with an approach that is neutral with regard to specific energy carriers or technologies. Focus will be on the cost-efficient and timely deployment of solutions on a large scale and the potential evolution of these factors over time. A life cycle assessment should be included and linkages or synergies with alternative fuel use in other transport modes should be explored.
Activities will be undertaken in close and formal cooperation with the H2020 STEERER project which is identifying strategic technological paths and priorities towards climate neutrality as well identifying business model evolutions. Therefore, the budget of this CSA is reduced. The project will support the waterborne community in the identification of market trends with a systematic approach to future scenarios, understanding of uncertainties and critical factors.
The project will liaise with EU and international bodies and their initiatives with respect to future fuel scenarios and emission control governance (e.g. FuelEU Maritime, ESSF, IMO) and will establish contacts with the main associations of fuel suppliers.

Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Reduced emissions and improved efficiency enabled through development of digital models and tools for a wide range of vessel types, ship systems and operational environments.
Prove and quantify the impact regarding emissions reductions and improved efficiency through productivity and performance increases based on a proven and efficient environmental impact assessment methodology.
Ensuring the wider applicability of digital models for different ship types, both for new constructions and for retrofitting, through a comprehensive methodology and a transferable system architecture.
Proving the interoperability of data models between different ship types and regarding the link with port digital twin models.
Benchmarking efficiency improvements against other industry sectors.
Increase the confidence of investors concerning the expected improvements in energy efficiency and reduced emissions resulting from upgrades and modifications for both new designs and retrofitting.
In the medium term, enable the development of the “zero emission decision support system” as a contribution to the 55% reduction goals of fuel consumption in 2030.
Scope:
The digital revolution is affecting most industrial sectors, enabling the digital modelling of designs, manufacturing processes and operations. A wider and better development of Digital Twin (DT) models enables new functionalities for the design and operation of vessels to improve operational efficiency to be developed and validated with increased confidence without resorting to more costly physical testing. DT modelling can be founded and validated using sensor data, data mining and merging, big data, AI and self-learning to improve efficiency on all levels. Such developments increase owner confidence in the expected performance when procuring innovative green systems as well as providing operational feedback to the manufacturer which can be used to further improve energy efficiency. In this respect DT models are understood as wide-ranging tools with known application areas and those still to be explored.
The waterborne (transport) sector is characterised by very diverse requirements and market realities. Ships, their systems and related technical and commercial processes are already widely using digital technologies including virtual models but those are generally developed individually and with significant overlaps. Capital expenditure is often very high. The wider implementation and integration of digital technologies into more coherent Digital Twins on-board and onshore supporting user oriented decisions is still in its infancy.
Whilst simulation environments are relatively mature maritime system tools, development to enable full exploitation of the potential functionalities is still lacking.
Activities will address the DT concept in order to improve energy efficiency and environmental performance from the early design phase of vessels to the end of the life cycle, thus providing assurance to the owner or operator concerning the expected improvements resulting from upgrades and modifications. This will be a key factor to achieve the zero-emission targets for waterborne transport, while increasing the understanding of vessel performance in a wide range of operations, in particular in the view of the parallel uptake of a multitude of innovative technologies for on-board energy storage, distribution and conversion as well as those for voyage optimisation and manoeuvring. A methodology to assess environmental impacts and performance improvements through the DT model should be developed and validated, with the definition of KPIs orienting the design choices and manufacturing processes.
Project(s) will develop DT models, preferably based on existing specifications and simulation environments, addressing different ship systems (e.g. engine and machinery operations, hull/propeller performance and interaction models, electric network management including in particular HVAC, cargo handling) in order to have a significant impact on energy efficiency as well as on operational performance, both in maritime transport and IWT and with regard to newbuildings and existing vessels. To this end the dynamic use of real life data (feedback loop) is expected to be addressed as well.

Increased attractiveness of transport related studies and reinforce the pursuit of excellence in European transport research and innovation, by giving recognition and visibility to the best achievements.
Scope:
The action will prepare and provide support to the Transport Research Arena conference (TRA) to be organised in 2024 gathering transport stakeholders for discussing political, industrial and research issues on a European and global level.
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the financial and organisational support of the national authorities' and a preliminary economic plan covering the additional funding needs. In order to ensure high political and strategic relevance, preference will be given to proposals involving Member States holding the Presidency of the European Union in year 2024.
In line with previous TRA biannual conferences, the event should address the technological and industrial developments of the transport sector (road, rail, waterborne, aviation sectors and cross-modal aspects) providing a high level, future oriented perspective coming from politics, the industry and the research community, in response to Europe’s social needs and expectations.
In collaboration with the relevant actors, such as the European Commission services, the different European Technology Platforms (ERTRAC for road, ERRAC for rail, WATERBORNE TP for waterborne, ALICE for logistics and ACARE for aeronautics and ECTP for construction), the Conference of European Directors of Roads (CEDR), the European Transport Research Alliance (ETRA) and the previous TRA conference organisers in order to maintain continuity, the action will define the overall planning of the conference, structure the technical and political sessions of the event, contribute to select the appropriate location for the venue and offer operational IT tools for the registration of participants, the handling of speakers’ contributions, contribute to the organisation of logistics, etc. Support to the organisation of demonstration activities should also be foreseen.
Specific attention should be put on a broad and balanced participation i.e. students, young researchers, women, a large number of countries' representatives, etc.
The proposal is expected to also organise two competitions for transport research and innovation awards covering all transport modes and cross-cutting issues (technological, socio-economic and behavioural aspects) in line with the EU policy objectives for climate-neutral and environmentally friendly mobility:
A competition for students and young researchers with the goal of stimulating the interest among young researchers/students in the field of transport;
A competition for senior researchers in the field of innovative transport concepts based on results from EU-funded projects only.
The organisation of these awards should ensure high-quality competition and very good media coverage before, during and after the TRA conference, in line with previous editions (TRA Visions). The competition is expected to give particular attention to gender issues."

Ability to perform advanced environment and traffic recognition and prediction, limiting false detections and non-detections of obstacles, with particular attention to Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), in order to reduce existing disparities in the harm-to-exposure ratios of these vulnerable groups.
Ability to determine the appropriate course of action of a CAV in a real world environment with a wide range of traffic scenarios and identify use cases in which the vehicle’s decision-making might be contradictory to existing traffic rules (e.g. to make way for a priority vehicle, to obey police officers directing traffic).

Standardization mandate for performance requirements for environment perception systems with respect to different automation levels and ODDs.
Scope:
To achieve secure and trustworthy interaction between vehicles, infrastructure and road users, robust (e.g. weather resilient) and accurate on-board environment positioning and perception systems are essential for the extraction of reliable information required for real-time driving decision-making. Furthermore, advanced on-board decision-making functionalities need to handle the diversity of use cases in their respective operational domains. Such functionalities have to guarantee the safety and reliability of future automated vehicles, which will integrate complex in-vehicle systems-of-systems with advanced sensors, control and actuators, relying on extensive computational power and an increased dependency on software for decision-making.

Contribution to at least one full scale demonstrator with the ammonia-fuelled marine engine used in a commercial vessel for main propulsion and/or (large scale) main power generation by 2027.
In the medium term, enabling operations for maritime intercontinental transport (tankers, bulk carriers, container ships, passenger ships) and realisation of bunkering infrastructures, depending on fuel availability scenarios.
Enable the timely transformation of the existing maritime fleet towards climate neutrality through retrofitting of existing vessels with ammonia-fuelled engines.
*Demonstration and validation of an ammonia-fuelled marine engine with power output in the +10 MW range. The validation shows safe and reliable operation in realistic scenarios and for a range of load cases.
*In case of proven feasibility pathways to the uptake of ammonia as a marine fuel for deep sea shipping and high power vessels are set out.
*Analysis of pathways to ammonia as a marine fuel through the establishment of regulations and solutions for health and safety issues.
Scope:
Deep sea shipping (maritime intercontinental transport) and ship operations with very high power demand require the storage of large amounts of energy carriers aboard in order to ensure the required autonomy and the ability to navigate safely in adverse and extreme conditions. The use of low energy density green fuels will in these operational environments lead to a significant loss of cargo volumes or useable space (e.g. passenger cabins) which directly impacts the economic parameters of the vessels and consequently leads to reluctance by ship owners to invest in clean ships.
Ammonia is a zero carbon fuel, with a (slightly) higher volumetric energy density than liquid hydrogen and with comparatively high liquefaction temperatures and pressures. Due to this, and its combustion characteristics, green ammonia has been widely advocated as a potential sustainable alternative marine fuel. Yet its possible use within a large low-speed marine engine has yet to be proven. A practical and easy use of ammonia may be a game changer in making shipping climate neutral, in particular if it can be used in the existing fleet through retrofitting.
The aim is to develop, demonstrate and validate a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine of at least 10 MW power output running on ammonia as its main fuel, with IMO-Tier III or lower NOx emissions and negligible emissions of SOx, particulates and other harmful substances or odours. As an indication total tank-to-wake GHG emission reduction versus an MGO baseline should be at least 80% (taking into account that the climate-neutral upstream supply of ammonia is not part of this topic). Risks should be assessed and the engine should also comply with all relevant safety rules and regulations as stipulated by classification societies and flag states.
Projects should demonstrate the engine operating at its rated power in a laboratory or on board of an actual vessel, thus going beyond the state of the art which is currently demonstrating ammonia combustion in smaller (road vehicle-based) test engines, or rapid compression machines.
Assuming feasibility, pathways toward deployment will be proposed.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Cleaner urban air and water quality and reduced health impacts and damage to historic buildings due to lower emissions from road transport by 2025.
Affordable and adaptable retrofit solutions that with a fraction of the vehicle market value (e.g. 10% or less), could reduce the emissions of the existing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) based fleet by over 50-60% for NOx and 90% for particles (exhaust emissions).
Avoidance of transfer of pollution from high to low-income EU countries (exhaust emissions).
Reduced health impact for highly exposed groups like public transport workers and users (emissions from brakes).
Affordable and adaptable retrofit solutions to reduce particle emissions by over 90% for particles both in terms of numbers and mass (emissions from brakes).
Reduced impact by heavy metals on soil and surface and ground waters (emissions from brakes).
Reduced noise impact for retrofitted vehicles (exhaust emissions) and rolling stock (emissions from brakes).
Scope:
The impact of transport on air and water quality has been repeatedly found to be due to tailpipe emissions from older vehicles, vehicles exceeding emissions limits in real driving conditions, or by vehicles, which, by not being subjected to specific limits, have high emissions of certain pollutants (e.g. ammonia-fuelled vehicles which emit a high number of particulates).Considering that the current automobile fleet in Europe is unlikely to be significantly renewed within the next 10 years, the proposed research actions should address emissions of nanoparticles from indirect injection (i.e. conventional) gasoline and natural gas engines or Pre-Euro 6 c direct injection gasoline cars that will continue to occur for the next couple of years. In all these cases, when the vehicles are sufficiently recent and therefore not candidates for scrapping, the proposed actions on retrofit technologies should aim at reducing real emissions at a relatively low cost, thus providing an early improvement of air quality without waiting for the vehicles to be replaced (or exported to other markets, thus just shifting the pollution to poorer countries).
The Horizon Prize for the Cleanest Engine retrofit has already demonstrated very high NOx reduction performance on a high emitting Euro 5 diesel, and one of the participants has brought a product on the market, while at the moment no solution is present on the market for ammonia and particulates by vehicle categories not fitted with particle filters (natural gas cars, trucks and buses, gasoline cars). Therefore, the proposed actions should demonstrate in the field the results of deploying available retrofits, in particular to public and private fleets running high numbers of kilometres within the city (buses, delivery vans, taxis), as well as developing and demonstrating new, low cost retrofit technologies for natural gas buses and natural gas and gasoline cars in the above mentioned applications, with a clear validation in real driving of the reduction of emissions. The proposed actions should also consider awareness raising of little known emissions issues (for instance, ammonia and nanoparticles below the regulated threshold) and specific incentive schemes to facilitate the adoption of these technologies should also be considered, taking into account the results of the currently running EU-funded projects on retrofits.
In addition to tailpipe particles, there is a growing awareness of the contribution by tires and brakes from road and rail vehicles. Brakes, different from tires, have the potential to emit large amounts of very fine particles and these can include harmful materials like heavy metals and resins. Moreover, they contribute to poor local air and water quality in specific and sometimes closed environments like bus stops, tunnels and train and metro stations. Therefore, the proposed activities should assess the specific contribution of brake particles on local air and water quality, possibly including citizen science contributions, for instance to assess the situation of complete network of metro and rail stations in cities or workers exposure, and to develop low cost retrofit solutions for these transport vehicles and demonstrate existing solution in the field to assess their benefit and usability/operating costs, while at the same time reducing the acquisition and installation costs, both for first installation and retrofitting (specifically on long-lived public transport assets).
In some specific cases, like urban heavy duty vehicles and rail rolling stock, noise is also an issue, therefore the retrofit solutions for these applications should also look at reducing exhaust noise, particularly during transients, while low particle emissions brake solutions should also look at integrating ways to reduce brake noise.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.
Typically, projects should have a duration of 36 to 48 months. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.

Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
In-depth assessment of the noise and pollutant emissions of at least 150 L category vehicles, starting from the 10 top sellers of the different subcategories having significant sales (at least mopeds, 125cc, 250cc, 500 cc and above 500cc motorbikes, l6 and l7 microcars, light freight transport 3 and 4 wheelers), including different brands and geographical coverage. This will allow to take into account a large share of their environmental impact.
Measures for mitigating the noise from L category vehicles.
Development of reliable detection techniques for tampered L category vehicles.
Best practices for integrating a growing number of L category vehicles in the urban traffic without increasing the noise and emission pollution.
Scope:
Noise pollution is a growing environmental concern and has been affecting quality of life and well-being. It is caused by a varied number of sources and is widely present not only in the busiest urban environments, it is also pervading once natural environments. The adverse effects affect the well-being of exposed human populations, in the health and distribution of wildlife, in the abilities of our children to learn properly at school and in the high economic price society must pay because of noise pollution. Health effects, for instance, can be as bad as increasing the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
Whilst the increase in traffic volume results in higher noise levels, the increase in urbanisation results in a higher number of people affected by noise. As a result, the adverse health impacts, both direct and indirect, of traffic noise are expected to increase in the future despite potential noise-reducing improvements in vehicles, tyres and roads.
One of the ways of reducing noise from road (or rail) traffic is by tackling the problem at source. Setting lower emission limits via regulation is doubtless effective if it is based upon an appropriate test methodology, and good results have been achieved on large vehicles. However L category vehicles are often perceived as a significant contributors to noise pollution and this might be due to the fact that noise emissions seem to be strictly optimised for specific conditions (but also due to tampering by their users, which in some cases is made too easy by the way the vehicles are built). Moreover, recent measurement campaigns in EU funded projects found some motorbikes having extremely high nanoparticles emissions. Real driving portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) tests will also allow to verify if there are issues in emissions testing, while lab tests should assess the risks posed by particle emissions down to 2.5nm. Tampering is also often performed in order to increase performance, leading to higher emissions.
There proposals should address the following:
Assess the behaviour of a large sample of these L vehicles in real driving conditions for both noise and emissions in comparison with certification tests (complemented where necessary by lab tests, since mini-PEMS cannot measure certain pollutants like particles, ammonia and hydrocarbons).
In particular, assess the real world driving behaviour that can produce particularly high annoyance and effect on health (noise emissions).
Propose specific technical improvements in the standard test procedure (performed in homologated test tracks) so that the tests could better approach real world driving conditions and improve measurement technology for detecting nanoparticles.
Assess how significant the impact of these emissions is on urban environments and health and examine whether the current regulatory limits are sufficient.
Assess how widespread tampering is, its impact on global urban noise and emissions lev, its impact on global urban noise and emissions levels, and propose solutions to prevent it.
Develop reliable technological solutions and effective experimental techniques for better enforcement of the regulatory measures for detecting noise under real driving conditions
This action will be focussed in particular in cities and regions with high powered two wheelers use and the derived knowledge will provide significant support to designing future measures aimed at reducing the noise and pollution emission levels from these vehicles.
Projects should make use of available results and technologies from projects funded in projects on remote monitoring issuing from topics LC-MG-1-1-2018 and LC-MG-1-9-2019, from projects on tampering LC-MG-1-4-2018, and from projects on nanoparticles measurement issuing from topic GV-02-2016.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the objectives of the biodiversity and farm to fork strategies, a successful proposal will support the transition to more sustainable practices in agriculture by reducing the need for external inputs and supporting biodiversity in agroecosystems.
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
A better understanding of root-based traits (including the capacity to establish beneficial interactions with soil biota) and their genotypic variability as well as increased insight into the (adaptive) phenotypic plasticity of roots;
Enhanced capacities for root phenotyping under controlled and on-field conditions;
The delivery of strategies for breeding for below-ground traits capitalising on more effective interactions between plants and microorganisms in the rhizosphere;
An increased use and valorisation of genetic resources (in situ and ex situ) for root based traits.
On the longer term projects will contribute to: the development of crops (annual and perennial) and forest trees that are more tolerant to abiotic stress conditions, require less external inputs (e.g. fertilisers and pesticides) and show an increased capacity for carbon sequestration, thereby contributing to adaptation of agriculture and forestry to climate change.
Scope:
With increasing effects of climate change and a shift towards low(er) input production systems, there is the need for crops that are capable of capturing resources more efficiently and are resilient to abiotic stresses.
The root system and its interaction with soil biota is crucial for nutrient and water acquisition as well as for the capacity of plants to adapt to changing environments and to be more tolerant against pests and diseases. Phenotypic plasticity is key for plants to respond to varying soil conditions and highly dynamic distribution of soil resources. The size and architecture of the root system also determine the allocation of carbon in the soil. Breeding for root traits is therefore a promising strategy to increase plant stress resilience while also enhancing soil carbon sequestration.
Proposals should:
Identify root traits that increase resource efficiency of plants in different environments, taking into account beneficial plant – microbe interactions and the restitution of plant-fixed carbon to the soil;
Increase our knowledge on the (molecular and biochemical) plasticity of root responses and their metabolic mechanisms to environmental cues;
Improve existing and/or develop new root phenotyping tools (including image analysis protocols) to be used in controlled and on-field conditions, thereby overcoming the root data bottleneck;
Develop strategies to implement “root breeding”, i.e. select for desirable root characteristics and exploit the genetic variation in root traits.
Activities should be carried out in a range of agronomically relevant soil conditions.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal should support the objectives of the EU biodiversity and farm to fork strategies to transition to fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption, notably the objective to increase organic farming. They should do so by increasing the availability of and access to suitable plant reproductive material for organic crops and by increasing the competitiveness of the organic crop breeding sector. As such, activities funded under this topic will help the EU achieve the target of at least 25% of the EU’s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030. Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Greater knowledge of relevant traits for organic crop production;
Improved and open access to a wider pool of high-quality plant reproductive material for the organic crop sector;
Improved adaptation of new organic crop varieties and organic heterogeneous material to organic farming conditions (e.g. agronomic performance under organic cultivation practices, disease resistance, resilience to drought, longevity, adaptation to different pedo-climatic conditions, nutritional quality, etc.);
Improved identification and traceability of organic heterogeneous material (OHM);
Increased competitiveness of the organic crop breeding sector achieved by (i) improved availability of breeding strategies for organic crop production; (ii) novel governance and financing models supporting new breeding initiatives for organic crop production; (iii) increased relevance of the organic sector for commercial plant breeders and seed producers generating increased demand for organic seed and breeding; (iv) improved quality and transparency in the organic plant reproductive material market; (v) training, demonstration and networking.
Scope:
Promoting the use of more sustainable farming practices is an EU policy objective enshrined in the European Green Deal and its related strategies. Boosting organic farming in the EU, one of these objectives, can greatly contribute to achieving the ambition to significantly reduce the use and risk of inputs in farming while making agriculture more resilient, including through increased (bio)diversity. Increasing the availability of organic varieties for the organic sector that are better adapted to different and variable conditions is important in order to improve the performance of the organic crop sector. Application of the new organic Regulation[1] (EU) No 2018/848 has the potential to support higher levels of biodiversity and greater resilience in the organic sector with the use of new tools such as the definition of organic heterogeneous material (OHM) and organic varieties. The possibility to use landraces can also revive traditional and regional crops. However, achieving adequate and timely upscaling of organic breeding and seed production that meet growing market demands can be challenging for the sector. Strong involvement from public and private actors, novel governance and financing models for breeding, variety testing and seed production, as well as training, are needed.
Proposals should contribute to improving the availability and quality of plant reproductive material and the selection of varieties suited to the specific conditions of organic farming, in line with the objectives and requirements for organic plant reproductive material set out in Regulation (EU) No 2018/848 and the transformation of the EU’s breeding sector. Proposals must implement the ‘multi-actor approach’ and ensure a value chain approach with adequate involvement of the farming sector. Activities should take into account the diversity of seed systems in the EU. The topic is open to all types of organic farming systems in various geographical and pedo-climatic conditions. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Proposals should develop measures to support the preservation of genetic resources and increase the availability of plant reproductive material for the organic sector, including through pre-breeding and breeding activities and new approaches to seed sourcing.
Proposals should develop measures that contribute to the development of organic heterogeneous material[2] and varieties suitable for organic cultivation for an increasing range of crops, including arable, forage and horticultural crops.
Proposals should develop specific protocols for testing new organic varieties. Measures should consider the adaptability of OHM and organic varieties to different climatic and edaphic conditions, and resistance to pests and diseases, as well as combining these assets with crop stability, productivity and nutritional content in order to maintain a level of competitiveness of the organic plant reproductive material. The potential of OHM to foster and improve the use of traditional material in organic crop farming should be analysed.
Proposals should develop a toolbox to identify OHM and a system to ensure OHM breeding traceability and maintenance. Case studies of innovative engagement of value chain partners in organic plant breeding in different contexts should be analysed and key factors of success should be identified. Proposals should develop governance and financial models to support organic plant breeding that include all actors in the value chain. Proposals should conceive marketing and value chain development strategies to introduce improved varieties for seed multiplication and treatment, ensuring quality and transparency in the organic seed market. Proposals should set up new networks, and expand existing ones where relevant, to demonstrate and test organic crop breeding in different pedo-climatic regions across Europe, with an emphasis on regions where the organic sector is less developed. Proposals will give attention to participatory on-farm demonstrations. Proposals should design training packages tailored to the specific needs of different actors of the organic breeding and seed business to strengthen their capacities and increase breeding gains.
Proposals should develop scientifically robust and transparent methodologies, building on achievements from previous research activities. To ensure trustworthiness, swift and wide adoption by user communities, and to support EU and national policy-makers, actions should adopt high standards of transparency and openness, going beyond ex-post documentation of results and extending to aspects such as assumptions, models and data quality during the life of projects.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will contribute to the European Green Deal and international objectives to foster climate change mitigation, pollution prevention and control, and adaptation in agriculture. It will in particular support the farm to fork strategy objective for a transition to a fair, healthy and resilient European agriculture. It will contribute to climate action on land and more specifically towards climate neutrality by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhancing natural carbon sinks: better understanding and mobilising the mitigation and adaptation potential of livestock farming and related sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources.
The following outcomes are expected:
Enhanced adoption by farmers and other relevant actors of innovations that increase the mitigation and adaptation capacity of livestock farming systems to climate change, at animal, population and farm level, therefore improving the resilience of production systems as well as animal health and welfare.
Improved capacity to assess the environmental and socio-economic impact of mitigation and adaptation practices and options at different scales, alone and in combination.
Consolidated transition towards a resilient livestock production with novel integrated approaches (in terms of management, breeding, feeding, local resources use, etc.) defined for different climate change scenarios.
Scope:
Terrestrial livestock production is considered a large contributor to anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide and emissions of pollutants to air and water. Although emission intensity in Europe is lower in comparison to many other regions of the world, options to better assess and improve the emissions balance of terrestrial livestock production, weather intensive or extensive/low input, including organic, are necessary, including the evaluation of appropriate indicators of GHG emissions in different breeds, environments and production systems, in order not to rely solely on a reduction of the demand in food of animal origin to improve the emission balance of the sector. A variety of options have been identified, but are not yet common practice, and the potential of breeding to contribute to an improved GHG balance was not much investigated so far. In addition, the likelihood of further climate change occurring, and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts require addressing agricultural adaptation of the livestock sector as well.
The proposals should investigate at different levels (animal, herd, farm and sector, region) and with a coherent approach, practices and innovations that enable a reduction of the net GHG emissions by terrestrial livestock, while striving to ensure farm viability and resilience of productions systems, including adaption to climate change, and taking into account the impact on the environment and biodiversity. Trade-offs within and between the different levels should be addressed. At animal level, the research should use systems biology to study interactions between host and environment (e.g. feed and microbes) and how this interplay affects the efficiency of feed utilisation (energy and proteins) and GHG emissions, not least methane. Proposals should define and investigate traits/phenotypes, and the potential of breeding, to reduce GHG animal emissions or/and adapt to climate change. At farm level, different husbandry practices should be addressed. At sector/regional level, a system approach should investigate how different actors can cooperate to improve the GHG balance of livestock production, optimising the use of resources, including feed (e.g. production and origin), improving circularity. In addition to biophysical research, the proposals should address the potential socio-economic impact of the proposed practices and innovations, and look at options to facilitate their uptake. Proposals should develop or refine related tools for a proper assessment of practices and proposed innovations. Proposals should take into account novel farming systems and future scenarios, different breeds, particularly local breeds, various management approaches, climatic conditions and regional specificities. Proposals should address at least cattle and pigs and may address any other relevant species.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector, terrestrial livestock breeders, advisers and other relevant actors.
The proposals should take into account other EU-funded projects, including those funded under the ERA-NETs SusAn[1] and ERA-GAS[2].

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In support to the European Green Deal and climate initiatives, and the EU Arctic Policy, successful proposals will contribute to strengthening the ocean - climate nexus and our understanding of the ocean and polar regions, as an integral part of the Earth’s climate system. Successful proposals will further the science for understanding key processes that link the ocean to climate and people. They will allow for a better understanding of the nature and magnitude of these processes, and the impact of human activity on them. Given their specific vulnerability to climate change, this knowledge may help formulate the appropriate policy action to better protect the ocean and the polar regions and help ensure their health, integrity and resilience.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased predictability and reduced uncertainty associated with key oceanic and polar processes and advanced understanding and science of the ocean-climate nexus.
Contribution to the next generation observation and modelling of key ocean-climate processes and indicators.
Contribution to the implementation of the EU Arctic Policy, the All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance, the European Commission-European Space Agency flagship action on polar changes & global impacts, European climate policies and a substantial contribution to key international assessments, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and ecosystem services (IPBES), World Ocean Assessment (WOA) and other major regional and global initiatives.
Scope:
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the Earth climate. It can significantly imprint the vertical structure of global ocean heat uptake and drives a large part of the deep-ocean oxygenation and deep storage of anthropogenic carbon. The AMOC is expected to slow down with climate change with strong impact on the oceanic heat storage, carbon pump, and ventilation. Such change in the AMOC is also expected to impact the polar regions that are already experiencing warming at a faster rate than other places. Indeed, the current climate in polar regions is influenced by interactions between the ice sheets, the ocean, sea ice and atmosphere, and their response to anthropogenic climate forcing. Both the Arctic and Antarctic are connected to global climate through several feedback mechanisms, such as the AMOC, snow albedo effect, sea level rise from melting glaciers and ice sheets, changing terrestrial ecosystems that lead to changes in fluxes of carbon dioxide, and methane nutrients. Several of these processes exhibit tipping points (e.g. methane hydrate release in a warming Arctic Ocean, thawing permafrost and release of carbon). Potential tipping points in the polar regions include a significant slowdown of the AMOC and a destabilization of Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets. There is deep uncertainty regarding the contribution the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet will make to mean global sea level rise towards the end of this century. The potential consequences vary greatly from region to region making the information needed at local and regional level highly relevant for supporting local and regional adaptation decisions. The Southern Ocean controls the natural release of CO2 from the ocean, helps to absorb anthropogenic CO2 and modulates transport of heat towards the Antarctic ice cap. The largest anthropogenic storage of CO2 is in the North Atlantic. The observational record is not long enough to determine if changes observed in the circulation of the Atlantic and Southern Oceans are due to natural variability, or are a response to anthropogenic forcing.
Actions should aim at developing innovative approaches to address only one of the following options:
Regional & global components of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)
Actions should further the research on how and why the AMOC has changed over time, and how it will evolve in the future. Actions should endeavour to understand the entire system of the AMOC, as well as its links with the world ocean circulation system, in particular with the polar oceans. Actions should enable the sustained and sustainable observation of the AMOC by improving, developing and/or deploying existing and novel methods and technologies to observe the AMOC and its functions in the Earth system, and may include the development of advanced methods and digital technologies such as machine learning algorithms and multiple observational constraints. Observations should address climate change indicators, including indicators of past climate change, measurements of ocean heat content and currents, carbon dioxide solubility and fluxes, modifications of ocean circulation and climate feedbacks.
Action should address observational gaps of existing AMOC observing systems, focusing for example on formation regions, ocean boundaries and topographic constriction points, which are not or only poorly observed by large-scale observation systems such as the Argo array of profiling floats, or current generation satellite altimeters. Emerging technologies such as ocean gliders, remote mooring telemetry and autonomous vehicles offer opportunities to streamline traditional transport mooring arrays. This will lead to a more precise assessment (key for e.g. IPCC reports) of the risk of rapid changes using the newly released CMIP6 database and high-resolution models developed, inter alia, within the EU Horizon 2020 framework programme. Actions should add new observations of biogeochemical parameters (including carbon) and ecosystem-relevant quantities to observing arrays, thus providing synergy and optimisation of the long-term research infrastructure. Actions should also include reconstructions of deep boundary current intensities at different time scales to better discriminate/characterise anthropogenic impact from natural variability during the observational period. Actions should focus on improving models to better understand short-term variability and impacts on European and global climate. Moreover, action should interpret the recent changes in this context, to understand how close we may be to a climate tipping point.
Improving understanding and observation of Antarctic key processes and the Southern Ocean circulation
Actions should endeavour to reduce the deep uncertainty regarding the Antarctic contribution to global mean sea level rise towards the end of this century. Action should further the science and understanding of the dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet and its climatic triggers, which constitute the major source of uncertainty about sea level rise. Actions should endeavour to understand the sensitivity of the low-latitudinal oceans to freshwater fluxes in order to advance the comprehension of the dynamics and functioning of the southern sources of deep waters, the Antarctic bottom water (AABW) circulation and thus counteract the deficit of scientific knowledge limiting the complete understanding of decadal to millennial time-scale climate change. Actions should focus on the potential importance of feedbacks between the northern and southern sources of deep waters. Actions should endeavour to close the gap towards producing an integrated view of the planet's climate system and the role of Antarctica in it. Actions should focus on understanding the Antarctica climate variability, Antarctic surface mass balance and the forces that control future change and responses to change, including tipping points. Actions should research the Antarctic ice sheet dynamics and integrate this knowledge into coupled ice sheet-climate models adapted to the Antarctic and Southern Ocean region, in order constrain and improve the accuracy and precision of predictions of future changes in global and regional temperatures, ocean acidification and sea level rise. Actions should reduce the gap in ocean observations in the Antarctica allowing for improved sea ice and weather forecasting and other environmental predictions that could improve the quality of various applications including search and rescue, coupling with numerical weather and seasonal predictions, historical reconstructions (reanalysis), aquaculture and environmental management including environmental emergency response. Actions should endeavour to understand how ice-shelf loss in Antarctica link with and impact on the ocean’s circulations system, in particular the AMOC, and the relationship between the relative strength of the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC) and AMOC.
For both options, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, with a strong linkage with the ongoing activities under the All-Atlantic Ocean Research Alliance, with participation from bordering countries and countries – beyond the EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe – that took part in the Arctic Science Ministerial. Actions under this topic should plan on a close collaboration among each other and with the EU Polar Cluster. Actions should build upon and link with past Horizon 2020 projects, EU PolarNET2, Copernicus, Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON), Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS), and other international Ocean Observing Initiatives. The R&I needs to be conducted in a multidisciplinary and ecosystem-based approach. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be made available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, GEOSS, and EMODnet).

The conservation and enhancement of Earth’s natural terrestrial carbon sinks such as soils and plants, forests, farmed lands and wetlands is crucial. The European Green Deal gives research and innovation (R&I) a significant role to play in supporting the design and implementation of policies that will ensure the achievement of the EU’s climate objectives. Project implementation is expected to contribute to mitigation and adaptation to climate change and help achieve climate neutrality by 2050.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Expand the knowledge base of climate related practices, resulting in increased application of climate neutral farming approaches, assessing and evaluating different methods with all relevant actors involved;
Speed up involvement and adoption by farmers of innovative / smart farming practices that mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and that foster adaptation of the sector to climate change. In the long term, this will support a more substantial contribution of the farming sector to mitigation of GHG emissions and to carbon storage;
Increased involvement of Member States’ and Associated Countries agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS) in climate-related farming issues, including through linking to the European innovation partnership ""agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) national / regional / local projects and to advisors, with a view to wider dissemination and interaction within the Member States.
Scope:
A wide adoption of practices contributing to mitigation of climate change and carbon storage by farmers is a priority to ensure that the EU reaches GHG mitigation objectives by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. Farming is also vulnerable to impacts of climate change; hence adaptation is of utmost importance. Mainstreaming the use of climate-smart practices has been recognised as a priority at the global level, including at the G-20. In particular, the engagement of farmers in this effort needs to be increased. Therefore, a strong involvement of Member States’ AKIS is needed, as well as the development of targeted advice to farmers on climate issues.
The aim is to establish a three level network in a phased manner over Cluster 6 work programmes 2021/2022 and 2023/2024. The first level is a network which will engage front-runner farmers introducing on-farm trials and demonstration of innovations, using existing knowledge both in the EU and Associated Countries. The second level is a network to connect to all advisors on the subject in the Member States, building on achievements of Horizon 2020 projects and EIP-AGRI operational groups and the development of Member States’ AKIS, to ensure the provision of targeted advice. The third level of the network will engage and strengthen the capacity of experimental research stations on climate issues.
The present topic deals with the level of commercial farms. This level will engage commercial farms led by sustainability-oriented farmers who are eager to pilot existing or new ready-for-practice techniques and demonstrate them to other farmers. The second level will aim at sharing broadly climate neutral ready-for-practice solutions through a collaborative innovation ecosystem, involving all advisors and the main AKIS actors and AKIS coordination bodies in Member States. The second level will be implemented through Topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-03 “Demonstration network on climate-smart farming – boosting the role of advisory services”.
Proposals should:
Network existing nationally or regionally funded trial farms, including those linked to universities and research institutes, and other farms not yet part of networks;
Exploit existing and develop new solutions through practice oriented on-farm testing and demonstration in a co-creative approach with the pilot farmers and their advisors;
Collect and compare tool-kits for assessing GHG balances at farm level, performance monitoring, decision tools, climate services, etc. for possible use on average farms;
Support the implementation of the EU carbon farming manual as foreseen in the farm to fork strategy and the implementation of the third party certification of carbon removals, as foreseen in the circular economy action plan;
Foster knowledge exchange within and among Member States and regions and establish links with the EIP-AGRI and Member States’ AKIS networks and coordination bodies;
Link the demonstration farms into an EU demonstration farm network including all Member States to stimulate effective cross-fertilisation among Member States. Include a sufficient number of farmers and their advisors per country, taking into account the size of the Member State and ensuring a broad EU coverage;
Proposals should include a task to collaborate with project of topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-03 “Demonstration network on climate-smart farming – boosting the role of advisory services” and a topic to be published in Cluster 6 work programme 2023/2024;
The project should operate for at least seven years and build on the outcomes of the climate-related projects from various funding sources. The project must implement the multi-actor approach and may involve social innovation.

As such, activities should deliver dependable and transparent knowledge base for EU policy design and implementation (common agricultural policy (CAP), European Green Deal objectives, farm to fork and biodiversity strategies, etc.).
Project results are expected to contribute to at least two of the following expected outcomes (depending on the activities covered):
Improved qualitative and quantitative data availability of the contribution of agroforestry to climate change (mitigation and adaptation), soil conservation and (agro-)biodiversity (including genetic diversity within species) and to greater economic, environmental and social sustainability of farming;
Improved configuration and management of agroforestry systems, including systems involving animal production, through models and tools;
Enhanced capacities of various actors to measure the economic, environmental and social performance of agroforestry, in particular at farm level and in relation with the support scheme designed under the CAP as regards environment and climate objectives, through appropriate methods and indicators;
A strengthened and more robust agroforestry innovation ecosystem and increased end-user acceptance and implementation of agroforestry in the EU and Associated Countries.
Scope:
Achieving sustainable agricultural production that fosters both climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity preservation and enhancement is a policy objective that implies finding a balance with farm productivity, socio-economic viability and wider sustainability goals. Agroforestry systems include both traditional and modern land-use systems where trees are managed together with crops and/or animal production systems in agricultural settings. These systems have the potential to increase ecosystem services - including soil carbon sequestration, water retention, erosion control, soil nutrients, pollination, pest- and disease-control - and biodiversity, while improving farming productivity, profitability and sustainability of farmers’ incomes. Implementation of agroforestry in the EU and Associated Countries needs to be boosted in order to maximise this potential. The management of agroforestry systems is critical for their positive impact on climate and the environment as well as to ensure a balance with productivity and profitability for farmers. This is essential to promote the uptake and long-term sustainability of agroforestry.
Proposals should increase knowledge of the contribution of agroforestry to ecosystem services underpinning climate change mitigation and adaptation, increased biodiversity and farming resilience and boost the implementation of this type of farming systems in different pedo-climatic zones across the EU and Associated Countries. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure involvement of farmers and all other relevant actors in the value chain. Proposals should cover the conventional, agroecological and organic sectors. Proposals should build on and expand existing knowledge, tools and initiatives developed by Horizon 2020 projects, and where relevant ensure coordination with those projects/initiatives. Proposals should include a clear plan to collaborate with other projects selected under this topic. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Proposals should address at least five of the following activities:
Design agroforestry systems for climate change (mitigation and adaptation) and increased (agro-)biodiversity that also ensure farming resilience to fluctuating climate, environmental and socio-economic conditions, farm income stability and enhanced ecosystem services, in different regions and pedo-climatic conditions;
Develop methods and indicators that allow the identification of newly established agroforestry systems and monitor their performance over time. Analysis of trade-offs and synergies (e.g. between ecosystem services and between the environmental and socio-economic benefits) should be included;
Develop models and tools adapted to real farm conditions and considering the full amount of food, feed (for systems including livestock), timber or biomass and ecosystem services produced, to allow the configuration and efficient management of agroforestry systems that take into account aspects such as tree renewal, adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses, selection and improvement of agricultural varieties and animals most suited for agroforestry, recovery and improvement of biodiversity, soil water related aspects, and erosion control, in different regions and pedo-climatic zones;
Building on existing tools and methods where available, enhance quantification of the contribution of agroforestry to ecosystem services underpinning climate change (mitigation and adaptation) in relation to aspects such as carbon sequestration potential, stability of organic carbon in the soil (top- and sub-soil), reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion control, pest and disease control, increased organic matter in (top- and sub-) soil, and nutrient recycling, and develop indicators. When animals are present, animal production, health and welfare aspects should be considered;
Enhance quantification of the contribution of agroforestry to increased (agro)biodiversity, including on pollinators, and the linkages with soil quality and water quality and quantity, and develop indicators, as well as guidance for species selection;
Improve knowledge of the economic, environmental and social performance of agroforestry systems and their contribution to sustainable food and feed / non-food biomass production, analysing their productivity and profitability for farmers and factors influencing farmers’ decision-making, and considering aspects such as crop / tree and livestock / tree combinations, factors explaining yield response variability, tree size, animal production, a mix of traditional and new systems and applications, etc. Identify needs for new equipment, machinery and management tools;
Building on existing tools where relevant, develop a model to measure the impact of policies on agroforestry, both in terms of barriers or incentives to maintain existing agroforestry systems and to establish new ones. Sharing of experience among stakeholders as regards relevant common agricultural policy (CAP) support to agroforestry should be promoted. The potential of labelling of products linked to agroforestry in support of and complying with the current relevant legal framework and, when the scope of activities would cover the food system, the future EU framework for sustainability food labelling, should be investigated;
Design and implement a plan to boost networking and research and innovation (R&I) support to agroforestry at regional level, building on and expanding existing networks and initiatives where available and relevant, and involving policy makers, regional authorities, institutions, researchers, consumers and other key stakeholders;
Develop a training package and guidelines to support farmers in designing business plans linked to value chain development to put in place and manage agroforestry systems in different regions.

A successful proposal will support the delivery of services and solutions for the implementation of the European Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy, through the deployment and exploitation of environmental observations[1], benefiting a broad range of end users and helping them restore biodiversity and ecosystems under threat, thus contributing to the global observation and monitoring of the living realm.
Proposals are expected to contribute to at least four of the following outcomes:
Better informed policy formulation for biodiversity & ecosystem services on European/national and regional level, built on enhanced understanding of better quantified and characterised changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services and the prediction of their trajectories;
Enhanced understanding of the adverse cumulative impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and in particular on habitats and key species at risk of extinction in sensitive ecosystems to define enhanced management, adaptation and mitigation actions;
Enhanced planning and ecosystem-based management of land and sea with the objectives to minimise the adverse effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on ecosystems and biodiversity;
Dependable data, information and knowledge to support adaptation and mitigation of biodiversity loss resulting from climate change and anthropogenic activities, through maximised exploitation of information and data from European data infrastructures, European programmes (such as EMODnet[2] and European research infrastructures[3]) and GEO[4] initiatives;
Support to the development of the European service sector regarding end-user climate services related to biodiversity and ecosystems and deliver usable results to the monitoring framework of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030;
A contribution to the EC-ESA joint Earth system science initiative[5] (in particular to the flagship action on biodiversity and ocean health);
Improved governance of biodiversity monitoring and reporting, in particular together with the ‘Rescuing biodiversity to safeguard live on Earth’ partnership[6], the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and GEOBON[7].
Scope:
The projects are expected to further the harmonisation, mobilisation, and uptake of monitoring and environmental data to better characterise and understand the natural and anthropogenic pressures on biodiversity, the extent of the destruction of natural biological resources and its connection with ecosystem conditions within safe planetary boundaries. There is a need for knowledge of both better quantified and more precisely characterised changes in biodiversity and related ecosystem services (in coastal, marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems), and of ecosystem status and quantified impacts of the main direct drivers of changes (i.e. land and sea use changes, pollutions, climate change, invasive alien species and exploitation of natural resources) on European natural capital.
The projects should deliver new Earth observation (EO) data services building on the potential of EO capabilities in order to address end-user needs facing the deterioration and destruction of their living environment and ecosystems. The projects under this topic should tackle issues raised within the European Green Deal calls[8] and provide solutions to halt biodiversity loss and protect vulnerable ecosystems, and ensuring ecosystem capacity to continue to provide services to society and the environment. The projects should make mapping tools and information solutions available, which are needed by a wide variety of end users in order to meet targets for conservation and restoration of diverse terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems. Hence, the development of tools to support decision-making and participatory management are crucial in this context. Solutions related to improving ecosystem health and resilience should be integrated into best practice monitoring activities within respective monitoring governance schemes. This should enable stakeholders and policy makers to take the right conservation and restoration measures, in particular with the use of a holistic ecosystem-based management in response to the urgent need for halting biodiversity loss and, consequently, alterations to ecosystem functions and sustain the delivery of precious ecosystem services.
Building on existing services and frameworks provided through GEO, EuroGEO[9], European research infrastructures, European Ocean Observing Systems, EMODnet, Copernicus, ESA[10] Earth Observation programmes and EGNSS, this topic should address the downstream part of the value chain to support mitigation and adaptation to climate change impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. The consortia should engage with end users and stakeholders, contribute to customising of data and exploitation platforms, deliver scaling-up and replication of existing service models, and brokerage of knowledge and dissemination to the public. The successful proposals should build on outcomes of EU funded projects such as Horizon 2020 projects like ECOPOTENTIAL[11], initiatives like EuropaBON[12] and programmes like LIFE[13], and should feed into the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity, and deliver usable results to the monitoring framework of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030.

Successful proposals will support local administrations and policy makers to apply a systemic approach preventing pollution from nitrogen and phosphorus, in line with the zero pollution ambition. Project outcomes will contribute to maintaining nitrogen and phosphorus flows well within safe ecological boundaries at EU, regional and local scale and to restoring ecosystems. Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Harmonised environmental protection policies and implementation actions delivered by local administrations and policy makers to achieve nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction targets at regional/river basin level.
Best practices shared in EU and Associated Countries to prevent pollution from nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to air/soil/water including the design of inter-sectorial governance models and policy implementation tools to deploy the concept of nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction targets.
Improved knowledge on the physical science of climate change.
Scope:
The quantification of nitrogen and phosphorus emissions reduction necessary to respect ecosystems’ health in order to achieve the objectives of EU legislation and the 2030 targets of the biodiversity and farm to fork strategies may be assessed through a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) load reduction targets approach. The scope of the topic is to develop a regional/river basin approach. The topic is targeted to stakeholders from regions/river basins or clusters of regions/river basins: local agencies of environmental protection, local administrators, scientists and experts in environmental impacts models. A cluster may be formed by two or more regions/river basins, in the EU and Associated Countries, with very similar characteristics in terms of territorial conditions or being neighbouring regions/river basins.
Proposals will:
Develop a robust and transparent methodology to identify safe ecological limit values (e.g. concentration in media) of N/P applicable at regional scale to ensure good status for ecosystems in air/water/soil, inside and outside the local scale and apply the methodology to regions/river basins of the consortium. The local territorial specificity will be taken into account, in terms of territorial extension, land use, orography, distribution of basins and fresh water bodies, coastline, lagoons, etc. A coherent set of environmental indicators and their limit values at local scale will be selected for each region/river basin, based on legislation, existing and announced objectives and on scientific evidence, including datasets from the long-term environmental monitoring campaign and tools[1]. Indicators of N/P limit values should align to the monitoring capacity of N/P patterns in the environment.
Review scientific knowledge of the contribution of N/P flows to climate change, including their impacts on carbon sink capacity of soils, of any other impact of N/P life cycle in the environment, of short-term and long-term dynamics of P in the soil matrix and its regional variation across the EU;
Develop and/or improve an existing methodology to assess N/P emissions (flows) from all economic activities that may exist in the region/river basin (i.e. agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, industrial sectors, including food/drink sector, water supply, water/waste management, bioenergy, fossil-based energy production, mining activities, transport, etc.) including unintentional losses (e.g. losses and run-off of agricultural nutrients into the soil) and their impacts on air/water/soil environmental quality. Apply the methodology to regions/river basins of the consortium. Data from existing initiatives, consolidated reporting from national authorities, elaboration from EEA, Eionet, ESTAT, etc. and existing modelling capacity, either locally available or based on a twinning process across regions/clusters shall be considered in order to facilitate harmonisation of the approaches;
Develop and/or improve an existing methodology to identify the N/P load reduction targets for all regions/river basins of the consortium to stay within local N/P limit values;
Apply existing[2]/develop new methodologies to model pathways to reduce N/P emissions to meet load reduction targets and at the same time prevent pollution in air, water and soil, contribute to climate change mitigation, protect biodiversity and avoid pollution swapping. Pathways may include but are not limited to: i) integrated land/marine and bioeconomy; ii) limiting livestock stocking density; iii) integrated agricultural practices, including agro-ecology, aiming at limiting N/P flows and any other environmental impacts; iv) nature-based solutions (e.g. in waste water treatments, soil remediation); v) integrated industrial innovation towards circularity, industrial symbiosis and innovative resources use to improve efficiency and reduce N/P emissions from industrial sectors and any other environmental impact;
Identify inter-sectorial governance models and design policy implementation tools at regional level, also to integrate policy requirements for environmental legislation and emission sources from many sectors, including measures to foster a systemic shift in societal aspects (e.g. approaches to address meat consumption, food waste prevention, greener mobility, consumers' awareness of environmental footprint of goods etc.).
Proposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded within this topic. If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing, they must make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may additionally be used).

It will contribute with new and enhance knowledge to the development of integrated nutrient management plan.
Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
Improve nutrient budget and flows by identification of optimal combinations of nutrients in different farming systems (conventional, agro-ecological and organic systems) following, when possible, a holistic approach of the plant and animal productions system.
New approaches and methods supported with sound indicators to monitor and measure nutrients flows and practices with the greatest climate change mitigation potential and water and nutrient leakages, and biodiversity preservation while ensuring economic farm viability.
Identification and targeted implementation of individual or combined region-specific agricultural practices that help balance nutrient cycles and Nature Based Solutions for plant and animal nutrition and health optimizing the use of external inputs and implementation of regulated deficit strategies.
Quantification of the potential to save particularly N and P emissions from the implementation of relevant individual or combined agriculture practices, e.g. organic agriculture, agro-ecology, conservation agriculture, improve organic and mineral fertilization management, etc., that enhance soils health and combat eutrophication and water pollution.
Improved nutrient budget at different scales, by sound quantification of the inputs and outputs of water and nutrients in different agricultural systems including quantitative environmental and economic indicators for farms, regions and/or products.
Enhanced models to identify contamination and pollution hotspots locally, to extrapolate to regional, national and global solutions.
Strengthened transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary research and integrated scientific support for relevant EU policies and priorities (common agricultural policy (CAP), Green Deal, the zero pollution action plan, the farm to fork, etc.).
Scope:
Sustainable agricultural production systems not only deliver nutritious food and other raw materials, they are also key drivers of economic growth in rural areas. Roughly 25% of the annually produced terrestrial agricultural biomass is used by humans, about 70% [1](mostly from grassland, by-products, and inedible crop residues) converted through animals into food and manure, and the remainder goes into biofuel. Unsustainable agricultural systems can cause a variety of adverse environmental effects, such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and air and water pollution due to poor management of nutrients.
When possible, the holistic consideration of plant and animal nutrition within the agricultural production systems could contribute to more sustainability of the food chain by promoting the minimization of nutrients leakage and improved nutritional values of fertilisers, feed and food. This approach could cover the basic nutritional elements (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen), the macro elements (phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sulphur) but also the trace elements (zinc, copper, iron, iodine, selenium, manganese). In line with the European Green Deal, the development of a nutrient budgeting approach could focus on the fluxes of carbon (C).
However, there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding the measurement and understanding of the impacts of nutrients flow in different farming practices (conventional, agro-ecological and organic systems, specialised and mix farming systems) at various scales, from local to global, and the capacity to model those impacts.
Proposals should build on existing and new knowledge, data, models (including in situ calibration measurement), artificial intelligence and tools to:
Optimise and harmonise nutrient and water flow models, indicators and data for quantification and assessment to prevent or reduce environmental pollution caused by nutrients, across sectors, for different types of agricultural practices (conventional, organic and agro-ecological agriculture), and scales – farm, local, regional and river basin.
Explore and assess safe alternative nutrient sources and pathways (e.g. organic vs inorganic), enhance management and recycling of organic wastes and explore nutrient recovery opportunities (e.g. by using treated sewage sludge or wastewater) as well as nutrient mobilisation through microorganisms;
Build upon available results from previous EU projects funded under the Horizon 2020 topic CE-RUR-08-2018-2019-2020: Closing nutrient cycles.
Enhance nutrient use efficiency at different levels.
Analyse climate change effects of certain nutrient flows, including interactions between nutrient, water and carbon cycles.
Develop biological models for nutrients flows remote sensing tools, in agricultural systems: for physical, chemical and biological parameters, using smart sensors and AI technologies.
Develop digital platforms to allow precision nutrient management at farm scale and landscape scale.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector and, as relevant, bio-based industry active in rural areas.

In line with the European Green Deal’s zero pollution ambition, successful proposals will contribute to halt and prevent pollution of freshwater and soils, and consequently also protecting biodiversity, as addressed by several impacts under Destination ‘Clean environment and zero pollution’, in particular “Advanced understanding of diffuse and point sources of water pollution in a global and climate change context, enabling novel solutions to protect water bodies, aquatic ecosystems and soil functionality, and further enhancing water quality and its management for safe human and ecological use, while fostering the EU’s position and role in the global water scene.”
Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
Wider use of an enhanced knowledge base required to assess and monitor pollution sources, transport pathways and impacts of diffuse pollution conveyed to receiving water bodies by urban water runoff and storm water overflows, including forward looking approaches aimed to anticipate and prepare for future or emerging challenges.
Implement advanced preventive and mitigating strategies to reduce diffuse pollution of urban waters based on source control measures and storm water management that also consider climate change impacts.
Apply effective risk assessment and risk management strategies enabling early warning systems and delivering ready-made outputs for decision-making and governance in urban areas.
Deploy innovative concepts, cost effective technologies and advanced sensors and monitoring approaches for sustainable waste water collection and urban drainage systems preventing pollution due to urban run-off.
Comprehensive urban runoff and storm water management plans implementing holistic approaches at city/catchment level to ensure resilient urban water quality and climate adaptation.
Broad uptake of advanced knowledge, breakthrough solutions and innovative technologies to enhance competitiveness of the EU water sector and fostering the EU’s position and role in the global water scene.
Increasing the EU scientific and technological base and guidance on measures to manage storm water quality and evidence for policy-making and implementation.
Science and evidence-based implementation of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals, notably the SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”.
Scope:
Good quality of fresh water is essential for human wellbeing and health, for supporting healthy aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, and crucial for agriculture and food production, three major components of the European Green Deal. Despite significant progress in reducing conventional water pollutants and improving freshwater quality, pollution loads from urban point and non-point sources remain an important challenge, particularly exacerbated in water scarce areas. Urban storm water runoff is a large contributor to diffuse pollution that impairs the quality of receiving waters and ecosystems and public health. Impacts of climate change, affecting e.g. the variability and intensity of precipitation, the concentration of pollutants and the temperature of runoff water, may further aggravate the problem.
Additional knowledge is needed on sources and transport pathways of diffuse pollution conveyed by urban runoff and storm water overflows, including emerging threats and challenges posed by climate change. This accurate knowledge is essential for developing preventive and mitigation strategies focussing on source control and storm water management measures.
Proposals in this field should aim to develop holistic approaches at city/catchment level ensuring resilient urban water runoff quality by considering different spatial and temporal scales and contexts, and different technologies. Urban runoff water quality management plans should consider micro-pollutants, contaminants of emerging concern, behavioural changes and societal and technical developments, including in relation to urban planning, buildings and mobility, construction and manufacturing materials, as well as sound risk management approaches. The identification and selection of measures to manage storm water quality will require engaging with relevant stakeholders, water utilities, public authorities and industry to develop guidance for decision makers and policy makers on urban runoff and storm water control measures and deploy easy and ready-made options for end users’ implementation.
Actions in this topic should also aim to develop innovative and integrated concepts and technologies, including digital advances, for urban drainage systems by combining advantages from blue-green-grey solutions and decentralised approaches to preventing and managing water pollution from urban runoff and storm water overflows.
In general, the participation of academia, research organisations, utilities, industry and regulators is strongly advised, as well as civil society engagement whenever necessary, also aiming to broaden the dissemination and exploitation routes and to better assess the innovation potential of developed solutions and strategies.
If appropriate, applicants are advised to seek complementarities and synergies, while avoiding duplication and overlap, with relevant actions funded under Horizon 2020 calls[1], as well as targeted topics supported in the last Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe calls, addressing micro/nano-plastics, persistent and mobile pollutants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs), pathogens and antimicrobial resistance.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The successful proposal will support tracing environmental impacts of biological resources production and trade by primary producers, traders and certification companies to enable responsible production in the industrial bio-based systems, in line with the 2030 Climate Target Plan and the zero pollution ambition. Project outcomes will contribute to establish circular bio-based systems reversing climate change, restoring biodiversity and protecting air, soil and water quality along supply chain of biological resources and industrial value chains, within the EU and across borders. Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
Certification schemes for international trade at EU and global scale of biological resources for bio-based systems include the environmental impacts and trade-offs along the bio-based supply chains.
Scope:
Assessment of environmental sustainability of biological resources production and trades in the bio-based systems is still a challenge. Indicators of such sustainability should build on dynamic perspectives at scales ranging, in space, from planetary to local ecosystems and, in time, from next decade to the end of century and beyond.
Proposals should:
Identify the range of biological resources intended for industrial bio-based systems at EU and local (regional/rural/urban/coastal) scale, including primary biomass resources production and biological secondary raw materials from rural/urban/industrial activities. Industrial bio-based systems do not include food/feed, biofuels, bioenergy and cultural/recreation sectors. However, relevant initiatives in the field of assessment and certification of environmental sustainability of biological resources arising from EU policies in the bioeconomy sectors should be taken into account. Aspects of trade of biological resources within the EU and at global level should be part of the analysis.
Collect data and figures on volumes of biological resources identified under a) in global trade flows and imports into the EU and their geographic distribution. The data collection should be based on existing and consolidated statistics and market databases.
Improve existing and/or develop new methodology for the assessment of the environmental impacts and trade-offs of biological resources in the scope addressing, but not limiting to, the following environmental categories: i) GHG emissions/savings and carbon footprint; ii) emissions from nitrogen and phosphorous based fertilisers; iii) land use and land use change and its related impact on land carbon sink capacity; iv) marine space use and marine space use change; v) water use; vi) biodiversity and ecosystem services; vii) energy consumption, viii) any other aspects of air/water/soil environmental quality. Assessments should consider the life cycle perspective and relevant regulatory requirements in terms of trade (across and within the EU), to the extent possible. Trade-offs and synergies with food production, nature-based solution to protect biodiversity or other resources use and ecosystem services (e.g. recreation, urban creep) should be included in the assessment;
Align methodology in c) with indicators (e.g. environmental, demographic, geophysics indicators) provided by consolidated and available database, including networks of environmental observations, efficiently.
Adapt methodology in c) to be suitable to definition/identification of environmental sustainability criteria compliant with the format of certification schemes in terms of either adopting existing certification schemes or developing of ad hoc ones. Criteria should be aligned with the Commission’s Taxonomy Regulation[1]. Traceability of biological resources at European and global scale should be essential part of certification.
Demonstrate the developed methodologies for the assessment of environmental impacts and trade-offs, sustainability criteria and certification schemes to a range of biological resources intended for industrial bio-based systems in an operational environment and deliver guidelines.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Proposals’ consortia should involve primary producers of biological resources, trade bodies, bio-based industries, agencies/companies developing certification, consumers’ organisations and any stakeholder along the supply chain of biological resources for bio-based industries.

The successful proposals will support awareness of environmental performances of alternative fertilising products and their uptake by stakeholders and local administrators, in line with the zero pollution ambition. Projects outcomes will contribute to maintaining nitrogen and phosphorus flows well within safe ecological boundaries at the EU, regional and local scale and to restoring ecosystems.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Orienting the production and the application of alternative fertilising products according with the best environmental performances and practices.
Local administrations formulate policies to support the development of sustainable local value chains deploying alternative fertilising products.
Scope:
The scope of this topic is the assessment of environmental impacts and trade-offs of the production and application of a range of fertilising products derived from secondary raw materials which could replace nitrogen- and phosphorus-based fertilisers produced from conventional processes (including mining and fossil-based processes) in a life cycle perspective. Examples of alternative fertilising products within the scope include products made from secondary raw materials such as, for example: recycled nutrients from urban and industrial waste water and sewage sludge, organic fertilising products from bio-waste, from any biological residue or by-products, from digestate and from treated manure.
Proposals should:
Collect all relevant data and figures on a range of fertilising products derived from secondary raw materials. Information should include all phases of their life cycle: production, distribution/trade, storage, application on lands and consequent transformation/diffusion into the different environments. The range of alternative fertilising products should be selected in order to cover at least one product from each main waste/residue raw material, i.e. at least one from each of: urban waste water, industrial waste water, sewage sludge, bio-waste, biological by-products, digestate and treated manure.
Apply and/or improve existing methodologies to assess the environmental impacts and trade-offs of the alternative fertilising products selected at point a) on a life cycle base, building on and complementing existing assessment results published by European Commission (project SAFEMANURE[1]). In particular, methodology and assessment should include the territorial and practical factors in terms of local vs global production and trade, local management procedures (storage, spreading on soils) also depending on specific agricultural applications and practices (e.g. agro-ecological vs traditional approach, current legislation at national level, within the consortium). Impacts and trade-offs should include categories on: climate change mitigation, including in terms of restoring the carbon sink capacity of soils, biodiversity and ecosystems protection, including soil biodiversity and below-ground ecosystems, land use and land use change, water consumption, energy use, nitrogen and phosphorus flows into the environment and any other pollutants’ emission that affect air/water/soil, including microplastics. Methodology and assessment should rely on existing procedures, e.g. Product Environmental Footprint method[2]and other validated/certified modelling and objective techniques, experimental tests, consultation of peer-reviewed scientific literature;
Relevant data may feed into the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment[3] if feasible;
Analyse technical aspects of the environmental impacts prevention and control operations during all phases of life cycle of the selected alternative fertilising products and their effectiveness. Include preliminary assessment of costs of installation/maintenance and social benefits of such operations. Alternative fertilising products under this proposal seeking market regulatory approval, should consider relevant regulatory requirements.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
Activities should include a thorough analysis of past research projects and studies developed under the EU funding programmes. Proposals should include a task dedicated to sharing methodologies and findings with projects funded within this topic. Proposals’ consortia should include stakeholders from the whole value chain such as producers of fertilisers and farmers, as well as scientists and experts in the analysis of environmental impacts of agricultural products.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal and its zero pollution ambition and Climate Pact, the successful proposal should support circular bio-based systems reversing climate change, restoring biodiversity and protecting soil and water quality along the supply chain of biological feedstock and industrial value chains, within Europe and globally, as well as deliver innovative “zero-pollution” bio-based biotechnology solutions and advanced bioremediation methods for environmental protection.
Project results should contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Improved bioremediation and revitalization strategies for contaminated environments, including soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater using recent advances in biotechnology;
New approaches for efficient bioremediation and resource recycling;
Provide science-based evidence and bio-based solutions enabling a better assessment of pollution threats from pollutants’ remobilisation to soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater;
Reduce the main negative impacts of pollution in terms of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services;
Validated newly developed and effective bioremediation methods in different environmental conditions, also based on microbiome exploitation potential;
Improved overall environmental performance (soil and sediment health, water quality, reduction of emissions, etc.);
Improved environmental footprint and lower toxicity of processes, products and services by means of biotechnologies;
Advanced assessment of effective methods of bioremediation with improved environmental, economic and social sustainability.
Scope:
Environmental pollution has been a major concern over the past few decades influencing the quality of life. Contamination of soils, sediments and water remains a major ecological problem. This pollution contains dangerous and persistent toxic substances that have adverse effects on human health and the environment. Pollutants resulting from human activity are detrimental to ecosystems at different functional levels, representing an important economic burden for society.
Remediation strategies, such as chemical and physical approaches, are not enough to mitigate pollution problems. Bioremediation using microbes is a sustainable, eco-friendly and socially acceptable alternative to conventional remediation approaches and helps improve the environment. It plays a significant role in monitoring “Zero-pollution”. Many microbes with bioremediation potential have been isolated and characterised but, in many cases, cannot completely degrade the targeted environmental pollutant or are ineffective in situations with complex contamination such as mixed waste.
The topic aims at improving bioremediation and revitalization strategies for soils, sediments, surface water and groundwater while respecting the EU legislation and regulations applicable in this area, including the use of naturally occurring and optimised organisms.
Proposals should:
Identify and analyse optimised proteins, microorganisms, microbiomes, plants, and animals (specifically fish and molluscs/bivalves including mussels) for sediment, watershed and wastewater remediation and revitalization (e.g. novel enzymes to degrade xenobiotic small molecules such as toxins, antibiotics and microplastics, selective uptake of non-degradable metal toxins, bioadsortion);
Identify and characterise plant platforms, microorganisms and microbiomes that can be optimised for efficient remediation of a range of contaminated environments (e.g. enzymes optimised for efficient bioconversion and/or biosequestration of environmental contaminants, biological tools/systems for land-based bioremediation, phytoremediation for contaminated industrial sites);
Identify and characterise plants transformed with pathways and metabolisms that enable the uptake of targeted contaminants and that have clearly visible ‘markers’ for public surveillance (for example, colours that clearly mark the plant as being genetically modified, so as to prevent people from eating these plants);
Develop strategies for efficient metabolic pathways of naturally-occurring species to be re-introduced into the environment;
Develop sustainable and cost-effective technologies for bioremediation of water resources used for water production and effective in situations with mixed waste (e.g. nature-based solutions)[1], [2]; and/or develop sustainable and cost-effective technologies for bioremediation of soil resources, including those effective in situations with mixed waste;
Enable new microbial approaches, such as combinations of synthetic auxotrophies, that increase the safety and reduce the risk of deploying optimised microbes in the field;
Develop and analyse the ability of defined consortia of bacteria, fungi algae and/or other organisms to most productively revitalise soil, sediment and water sources (for example, by researching functioning of ecosystems in the hyporheic zone, which plays a crucial role in the purification of bank filtered water and thus in ensuring a safe supply of drinking water in several countries);
Identify and assess (with quantification) the key environmental, economic, social and safety benefits of bioremediation and revitalization strategies for soils, sediments, surface water and groundwater compared to standard physicochemical remediation approaches;
Where relevant, proposals should seek synergies and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing research projects [3], [4]

The European Strategic Cluster Partnerships shall specifically contribute to the following:
- enhancing cluster managers' skills towards added-value SME support services;
- supporting the development and implementation of a comprehensive portfolio of new services for cluster members, including activities to strengthen interregional collaboration and partnership development across EU value chains while mobilising partners to contribute to upskilling and reskilling actions across industrial ecosystems in the light of the green and digital transitions;
- organising twinning, collaboration, networking and learning activities and cooperation projects;
- supporting the implementation of the “ClusterXchange” mobility scheme.
For this purpose, this call aims to bring together cluster organisations and other business network organisations from the EU Member States or countries participating in the COSME programme, interested in teaming up in European Strategic Cluster Partnerships.
Scope:
The overall objective of this action is to strengthen cluster management excellence and facilitate exchanges and strategic partnering between clusters and specialised eco-systems and cities across Europe, including through implementation of the “ClusterXchange” mobility scheme. As high quality cluster management and strategic connections between clusters are key elements of successful world-class clusters, the action aims to foster SME competitiveness and assist companies to successfully access global markets.
The specific objective is to enhance the collaboration, networking and learning of cluster organisations and their members towards the professionalization of specialised and customised business support services provided or channelled to SMEs. This shall further contribute to strengthen ties between European ecosystems and cities across regional and sectoral silos with the view to support a sustainable inter-regional partnering process and joint actions for strategic collaboration in various industrial specialisation areas linked to industrial modernisation and improving their business environment and workforce development.
This action also aims to act as enabler and multiplier of collaborations by initiating about 1000 matched exchanges via ClusterXchange and thus contributing to a better understanding of existing opportunities, for which the implementation and scaling-up activities could then be further supported through regional, national and EU programmes – such as the European Structural and Investment Funds, Horizon 2020, COSME and others.
The aim is to foster cluster excellence capacity-building and to promote cross-cluster learning in order to help cluster organisations and their members to acquire the necessary skills and take actions to explore and take up new solutions. This shall address training and business needs along the value chain that require SMEs and cluster managers to adapt to trends, challenges and opportunities that come along with industrial change. This shall also include the development of strategic approaches and plans for a better cooperation at regional, national and EU level to address innovation, growth and globalisation challenges that SMEs face as well as an effective contribution to the recovery process and seizing the opportunities deriving from the green and digital transitions.
This call shall further enable groups of specialised enterprises, notably SMEs, together with other innovation actors in industrial clusters, to find partners with complementary competences, to access value chains that cut across national, regional and sectoral boundaries as well as facilitate their access to technology centres and other scaling-up support organisations. This shall focus on engaging actors from regions with different levels of economic development – including from less developed and transition regions – and, likewise, cluster organisations with distinct stages of development and experience."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
While efforts have been made to make public services user-friendly and reduce the administrative burden, for example by making them increasingly available online, studies show that service design often does not meet the expectations of citizens and businesses, who require more usability, responsiveness and transparency, reflecting the different needs of users - some of whom may not be computer literate - and the variety of activities public services encompasses. Weak service design and high administrative burden often lead to non-use or non-take up by citizens and businesses of the public services and benefits available to them.
The profound understanding of end users including specific groups, like disabled elderly people, single parent families, disadvantaged citizens or immigrants, the re-design of services to respond to their capacities, needs and preferred delivery channels are important elements for governments to prove their ability to fulfil the needs of citizens and businesses. The old ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach is not appropriate for all spheres of the public sector; complex and varied service delivery; historical, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds play an important role in the expectations of interactions with public services.
The steady integration of new technologies into the everyday lives of people, businesses and governments is helping to open up public administrations, offering opportunities for more collaborative and participatory relationships that allow relevant stakeholders (i.e. citizens, business and non-governmental organisations) to actively shape political priorities, collaborate in the design of public services and participate in their delivery to provide more coherent and integrated solutions to complex challenges[1]. Co-creation of public services in this context is a public service that is provided by government, citizens, NGOs, private companies or individual civil servants, in collaboration or not with government institutions, based on government or non-government data or services.
Collaborative service creation (co-creation) requires public service actors to engage with stakeholders in the design, production and delivery phases, to gather the necessary user insight, re-define their operational processes and identify appropriate sustainability models to deliver an effective high quality service.
Given the opportunity to actively participate in service delivery, stakeholders (citizens, businesses, civil society organisations, social partners, etc.) can contribute distinctive resources (time, effort, ideas and expertise) and can keep public officials accountable[2]. The increased sense of ownership, greater efforts for the sustainability of public initiatives, as well as more creative ideas lead to an important shift in the role that civil society and the private sector can play in contributing to good governance[2]. It is also expected to help better prioritise and target public spending to the most important purposes and urgent needs.
Scope:
Innovation actions will pilot the co-designing and co-creation of public services, using ICT and relying on open data or open public services. They need to bring together a variety of actors in society, such as for example public authorities, citizens, businesses, researchers, civil society organisations, social innovators, social entrepreneurs, social partners, artists and designers, to co-create demand-driven, user-friendly, personalised public services and make effective decisions. Proposals need to identify the particular policy area, public institution or function to assess the suitability of incorporating co-creation and the transferability of good practices. Piloting needs to be carried out in a representative set of Member States in order to test different cultural/socio-political context for co-creating public services.
Proposals need to address several of the below aspects:
Using open services provided by public administrations and allowing third parties to design, aggregate, produce and deliver in collaboration with or without government value added complementary or new public services;
Demonstrating how government can act as a broad, open collaboration 'platform' in practice by demonstrating and/or piloting use cases for sharing data, services, tools, cloud infrastructures and assets between public administrations (e.g. experiments of hybrid teams in government) and resulting in re-usable services or processes;
Demonstrating how government can act as a broad, open collaboration 'platform' in practice by demonstrating and/or piloting use cases for sharing data, services, tools and assets with third parties and generating new or complementary services or making decisions;
Demonstrating how the perspectives of citizens, service users, and others can be taken on board through, for example, the use of design principles or behavioural analysis, in the creation of new public services or policies;
Demonstrating how transparency of government data, information or processes and the engagement of relevant stakeholders can lead to accountability and trust;
Developing business models that would enable financial remuneration for the public as data (or other asset) providers.
Proposals need to ensure that privacy and data protection issues have been appropriately addressed and that the tools piloted could be re-used. Any policy area may be subject to the piloting, including social policies and those addressing the vulnerable.
Proposals need to demonstrate the feasibility of their service or solution through a number of real-life pilots, demonstrate the concrete commitment of the piloting sites and need to propose a sustainability approach or model for the period beyond the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals need to demonstrate that they can achieve impact beyond the project phase, inter alia, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness gains, transactional cost reduction, productivity growth, stimulating the growth of new businesses, greater transparency leading to reduced errors and less public spending, administrative burden reduction, improved societal evidence, increased take-up of electronic public services by citizens, user satisfaction as well as in terms of the democratic dimension, such as increasing level of civic participation and social inclusion. Quantitative and qualitative aspects are to be taken into account. Additional impact may be improving the skills and adding new skills of public sector employees as well as third parties being agents and enablers of change and acting as innovation actors.

","Coordination and support action, Innovation action
","05 January 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Some of the main benefits of co-creation in public services are personalised approaches that appropriately suit the needs of citizens and businesses. A challenge for co-creation in the public sector is organising the collaboration between the different actors, including between public administrations themselves, in order to share information, knowledge and resources. Co-creation across borders contributes to achieving an effective Single Market.
Co-creation and collaboration between administrations can improve their efficiency and effectiveness by opening up and sharing knowledge and resources with the aim to unlock productivity improvements and foster the creation of more public value. Public administrations and government agencies can re-use the data already in their possession on citizens and businesses, under the control and consent of citizens and businesses, by sharing it between themselves. This can allow them to provide administrative services in a pro-active manner. Administrative burden of citizens and businesses will be reduced, legal obligations will be fulfilled faster and citizen services will be simpler and less cumbersome. Applied on a wide scale it can lead to a smart, inclusive and effective ""Once Only principle""[1] at European level.
In order to preserve privacy of citizens and business confidentiality, administrations would open up their information to another administration under the control and the consent of the citizen or business, in line with the EU's Data Protection legislation.
Scope:
In order to facilitate this personalisation and improve user experience, increasing digitisation of public services and the providing of key data only once with public administrations are important aspects. Its implication is that relevant public authorities need to cooperate not just at national level but also cross-border at EU level and share such data in a secure and user-friendly manner, respecting data protection and privacy and the sensitive nature of some of this data.
a) Innovation Actions
The countries participating in a proposal – covering the diversity of approaches across the EU - will need to enable the exchange of information or documents of businesses between their public administrations. The users, public administrations in the EU, will engage in the co-creation process, in order to collaboratively elaborate a common architecture. The project will enable the interaction and co-creation based on the existing national systems, and will re-use when relevant existing cross-border services, in particular services operated by the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) telecom programme. To demonstrate the robustness and the benefit to businesses the project must pilot the system for at least 12 months in real conditions. The free access to the foreground must be guaranteed to enable access by any Member State to the results specifications. The project will also identify the drivers, barriers, potential vulnerabilities and legal issues (such as legal barriers or gaps) for the implementation of the once-only principle for businesses across borders in Europe. The ultimate aim is that businesses should supply information only once to any public administration in Europe. Public administration offices take action to share this data also cross-border, thereby contributing to making the Digital Single Market a reality. The specific administration processes for businesses for piloting purposes will be identified in the proposal, building from a number of use cases.
The large scale pilot (IA) shall include a minimum of six relevant national administrations (or legal entities designated to act on their behalf) in at least six different EU Member States or Associated Countries.
The Commission expects to finance only one project under this action.
b) Coordination and Support Action[2]
Proposals for a Coordination and Support Action will support networking, discussion, exchange of experience and planning for the implementation of the cross-border application of the once-only principle for citizens, taking into account data protection aspects and the control and consent of citizens. The proposals will need to develop a strategic stakeholder engagement plan and roadmap for future areas of action.
The Commission expects to finance only one Coordination and Support Action for a maximum value of EUR 1 million.
Expected Impact:
Proposals need to demonstrate that they can achieve impact, which could be expressed, inter alia, in terms of time savings, administrative burden and cost reduction for businesses, improved service quality and administrative efficiency. Additional impact may be a step towards the 'whole-of-government' approach where the public sector acts as one entity, especially in its interactions with other actors including citizens and businesses.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Open Innovation
[1]The ""once-only"" principle in the context of public sector can be defined as that citizens and businesses should supply certain standard information only once to a public administration. Public administration offices take action to internally share this data, respecting data protection rules.
[2]This activity is directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders. It is excluded from the delegation to Research Executive Agency and will be implemented by the Commission services."

Deadline date","Scope:
On 20 April 2020, the European Commission adopted a work programme for 2020 for financing Pilot Projects and Preparatory Actions in the field of ""Communications Networks, Content and Technology""1.
Ranging from autism to dyslexia, dementia to learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities affect a significant number of EU citizens. As the digital transformation of society and the economy accelerates, and as more aspects of our private and professional lives move to the online environment, as witnessed by the current pandemic, equal access to the digital environment for these individuals is even more vital.
Cognitive disabilities can affect perception, memory, attention, orientation, problem solving, communication and comprehension.
Users with cognitive disabilities may struggle with complex, multi-stage processes, filling out forms or finding the content or feature that they need. Users with impaired short-term memory, for example, are unlikely to be able to remember passwords.
Users who have issues with keeping or regaining focus may find it difficult to complete tasks if distracted or interrupted, while users who find it challenging to process complex information may not cope with the content overload of lengthy web pages.
Users with language related impairments might not understand complex content or instructions and those with dyscalculia might not be able to correctly interpret numerical references such as percentages or decimals.
When using commercial services online, consumers with cognitive disabilities are at risk of entering contracts they do not understand or cannot fulfil, for services they do not need, cannot use or cannot afford. They may also struggle with online payment systems used in e-commerce.
By facilitating e.g. executive functions, knowledge acquisition, perception and comprehension, tools enhancing cognitive accessibility provide opportunities for users with cognitive disabilities to overcome barriers they frequently face online2, thus enabling them to interact with digital content and process information with more ease.
Such tools are needed to complement the work on web accessibility for persons with physical disabilities and to meet the related commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Web Accessibility Directive and the European Accessibility Act.
The objective of Pilot Projects under this Call is to foster the development of tools supporting independent and inclusive access to online content and services, including consumer transactions, for persons with cognitive disabilities, to fulfil the commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the EU Web Accessibility Directive3 and the European Accessibility Act4. Such tools will benefit all users, including vulnerable citizens affected e.g. by information overload, excessive credulity, psychosocial disabilities or old age.
In particular, proposals must address common accessibility challenges that persons with cognitive disabilities encounter on websites or mobile applications, such as
signing in or completing authentication processes;
entering data or filling out forms, avoiding and correcting errors;
accomplishing multi-stage tasks;
using complex interfaces and intricate navigation patterns;
processing information on cluttered pages, avoiding cognitive overload;
getting focussed on the task at hand, limiting interruptions, reminders, and changes in content;
stopping animations and auto-play videos or audios;
understanding text and graphics;
identifying key points from lengthy or heavy text based pages;
interpreting and processing numerical information, including managing dates;
finding information;
following instructions;
looking for help or support.
Priority will be given to proposals addressing most or all of the above accessibility challenges.
Pilot Projects may also propose the simplification or adaptation of web-authoring tools that persons with cognitive disabilities could use to create online content (content creation).

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Advances in-Space propulsion beyond the use of chemical technologies will enable a much more competitive development and exploitation of Space systems. The challenge is to enable major advances in electric propulsion for in-space operations and transportation, and guarantee the leadership of European capabilities in electric propulsion at world level within the 2020-2030 timeframe. The objective is to propose a Programme Support Activity (PSA), for the future implementation of a Strategic Research Cluster (SRC) in Horizon 2020. The overall budget for such an SRC could be in the range of several tens of millions of euros and should achieve a full in-orbit validation of the electric propulsion systems developed at pre-commercial level during the SRC. This validation is to be achieved not later than 2023.
Further information on the concept of a Strategic research cluster in Horizon 2020 is available from http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/research.
Scope: In-Space transportation begins where the launch vehicle upper stage separates. It comprises the functions of primary propulsion, reaction control, station keeping, precision pointing, and orbital manoeuvring necessary for all satellites.
Some of these technologies will be used in commercial and governmental communications satellites for orbit positioning and station-keeping. Further development is needed to maintain European leadership in this domain which is threatened by a very strong competition of non-European actors aiming at proposing all-electric platforms. Research and development of promising electric propulsion technologies, far beyond the current state of the art, is encouraged. The Power Processing Units (PPU) for the electrical thrusters will be considered as well. A first objective for the SRC is to foster incremental advances in the development of thrusters by extending their specifications and operative ranges by a factor of at least 3, including advanced studies in the areas of new power concepts, architectures and associated advanced technologies. A second objective is to set up activities for promoting possible disruptive RTD in the field of in-space electrical propulsion, including the increase of electric power for propulsion.    
In order to assess the commercial viability of the technologies developed, the proposal should envisage studying the impact of using electrical thrusters in several types of generic platforms. Examples of these are: propulsive modules of interorbital vehicles (as tugs for contribution to in-orbit services), transfer of different payloads towards deep space, GTO transfer for communication satellites, and orbit control. To validate the electrical thrusters to be developed at pre-commercial level during the SRC, a qualification flight will have to be executed not later than 2023. This will serve as a validation for future mission implementation.
Alternative approaches, not already planned for development by other entities are encouraged.
The Commission considers that one proposal requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The initial expected life of the PSA action is 5 years. In this time, the consortium should have delivered: 
         Collection and consolidation of requirements for future electric propulsion thrusters from European satellite primes
         Survey of available European electric propulsion technology and its technological readiness level
         Identification and definition of all the activities required to address the challenge of this topic. The contents of the activities must be in agreement with the objectives and boundaries defined in the scope.
         A fully detailed master plan to coordinate all the activities for the whole duration of the SRC.
         A plan for the analysis and evaluation of the results during the execution of the activities within the SRC.
         A plan for the specific exploitation and potential use of the SRC expected outputs.
         A risk assessment and contingency analysis for the SRC.
The execution of the SRC during a first period of 5 years will assure reaching the TRL-6[1] in the future devices that will form the next-generation of European electrical space thrusters. The goal at the end of the SRC will be to guarantee the leadership of European capabilities in electric propulsion at world level within the 2020-2030 timeframe.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: In the mid- and long-term the competitiveness of the space sector depends on the continuous incorporation of brand-new and even disruptive technologies. The European RTD investment in the field of very low-TRL technologies is to be enhanced. A number of challenges in space technologies have parallels to terrestrial challenges, for example in the fields of aeronautics, energy, environment, telecommunications and ICTs, natural resource exploration, sensors, robotics, advanced materials, security, and health.
Scope: New ideas must be incorporated into the current state of the art. As many of the advances come traditionally also from non-space sectors, an active search must be done in non-Space areas of knowledge in addition to the identification of breakthrough technologies from the space sector. This should mobilise the traditional space actors, and non-space actors, to look for space technologies of the future. The aim of this topic is to attract new actors to space and demonstrate technologies that are potentially disruptive and not only incremental. As “push” technologies, these will promise radical improved performances, and will enable emerging missions. Drastical increments in miniaturisation, power reduction, efficiency, versatility,  and increased functionality are as well expected.   
Proposals based on low TRL[1] (1-3) ideas and technologies which could have a final application in future Space systems are solicited. The target is to demonstrate them up to TRL (4-5). In this second call, proposals on several fundamental areas of knowledge are foreseen, in which for example some of the Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) are playing a major role. In particular, proposals are sought with relevance for the fields of: ""energy storage"", ""energy production"", ""materials and structures"", ""additive layer manufacturing techniques"", ""mechanisms"", ""wireless power transmission"", ""high performance and reliable electronics to boost on-board power"", and ""thermal control management systems"" in the domain of space.
The Commission considers that proposals implemented in less than 24 months and requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Only up to two proposals will be financed on each of the eight lines foreseen (""energy storage"", ""energy production"", ""materials and structures"", ""mechanisms"", ""additive layer manufacturing techniques"", ""high performance and reliable electronics to boost on-board power"", ""wireless power transmission"" and ""thermal control management systems"").
Expected impact: Spinning-in of new enabling technologies to space systems up to TRL 4-5 and clear indication of the ways in which these technologies can significantly improve performance and/or reduce costs if further developed.
Proposals should mobilise new incorporation of non-space actors, especially SMEs, and research groups into the space landscape.
Ideally proposals should result in developments affecting a range of sectors.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The space sector is a strategic asset contributing to the independence, security and prosperity of Europe and its role in the world. Europe needs non-dependent access to critical space technologies, which is a conditio-sine-qua-non for achieving Europe’s strategic objectives. ""Non-dependence"" refers to the possibility for Europe to have free, unrestricted access to any required space technology. Reaching non-dependence in certain technologies will open new markets to our industries and will increase the overall competitiveness of the European Space sector.
Scope: Research in technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness has been undertaken within the frame of the EC-ESA-EDA joint initiative on Critical Technologies for European non-Dependence, launched in 2008. Critical Components, which are integral part of critical technologies, have also been dealt with in the context of European Space Components Coordination (ESCC) and the Components Technology Board (CTB).
Activities to be proposed in this call will address technologies identified on the list of Urgent Actions as part of the Joint EC-ESA-EDA task force on Critical Technologies (see ""Excerpt from Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence – List of Urgent Actions for 2012/2013"" – June 2012 and the update for the 2015 call http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/research), focusing on those areas that have not so far benefitted from prior Framework Programme funding and representing the highest potential for being addressed through the co-funding instruments available in Horizon 2020.
A number of priority technologies have been identified for H2020 for 2015:
U4 - Advanced materials and material technology for combustion chambers
U6 - Fibre Optic Gyro (FOG) based Inertial Measurement Unit - IMU
U7 - Power amplification: Travelling Wave Tube (TWT) materials
U12 - High Capacity Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
 In this context, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries and proposals are expected to provide advanced critical technologies that are of common interest to different space application domains (e.g. telecom, Earth-observation, science, etc.), or even with applicability to terrestrial domains.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Without prejudice to the outcome of the evaluation process and with a view to covering all four urgent actions, a maximum of one proposal per identified Urgent Action line will be selected for funding.
Expected impact:
         To reduce the dependence on critical technologies and capabilities from outside Europe for future space applications, as identified in the EC-ESA-EDA Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence (see Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence – Background Document - 2011).
         To develop or regain in the mid-term the European capacity to operate independently in space, e.g. by developing in a timely manner reliable and affordable space technologies that in some cases may already exist outside Europe or in European terrestrial applications. Nevertheless, proposals should strive to go beyond the present state of the art or, preferably, the expected state of the art at the time of completion if alternative technologies are being developed outside Europe.
         To enhance the technical capabilities and overall competitiveness of European space industry satellite vendors on the worldwide market. The proposals are expected to open new competition opportunities for European manufacturers by reducing the dependency on export restricted technologies that are of strategic importance to future European space efforts. They should enable the European industry to get non-restricted access to high performance technologies that will allow increasing its competitiveness and expertise in the space domain.
         Proposals should include a work package dedicated to the development of a commercial evaluation of the technology, and should address how to access the commercial market with a full range (preload) of recurring products.
         Proposals should improve the overall European space technology landscape and complement the activities of European and national space programmes.
Proposals that include development activities up to space qualification will be favoured in terms of their potential impact.

Activities to be proposed in this call will address technologies identified on the list of Urgent Actions as part of the Joint EC-ESA-EDA task force on Critical Technologies (see Excerpt from Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence – List of Urgent Actions for 2012/2013"" – June 2012, and the update for the 2014 call in http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/research focusing on those areas that have not so far benefitted from prior Framework Programme funding and representing the highest potential for being addressed through the co-funding instruments available in Horizon 2020. A number of priority technologies have been identified for H2020 support from which proposers can choose:
U1 - Space qualification of low shock non-explosive actuators
U2 - Advanced thermal control systems
U5 - Alternative to Hydrazine in Europe
U11 - Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICS) for Mixed Signal Processing
U17 - High density (up to 1000 pins and beyond) assemblies on PCB
In this context, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries and proposals are expected to provide advanced critical technologies that are of common interest to different space application domains (e.g. telecom, Earth-observation, science, etc.), or even with applicability to terrestrial domains.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. A maximum of one proposal per identified Urgent Action line will be selected for funding.
Expected impact:
         To reduce the dependence on critical technologies and capabilities from outside Europe for future space applications, as identified in the EC-ESA-EDA Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence (see ""Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence – Background Document – 2011”).
         To develop or regain in the mid-term the European capacity to operate independently in space, e.g. by developing in a timely manner reliable and affordable space technologies that in some cases may already exist outside Europe or in European terrestrial applications. Nevertheless, proposals should strive to go beyond the present state of the art or, preferably, the expected state of the art at the time of completion if alternative technologies are being developed outside Europe.
         To enhance the technical capabilities and overall competitiveness of European space industry satellite vendors on the worldwide market. The proposals are expected to open new competition opportunities for European manufacturers by reducing the dependency on export restricted technologies that are of strategic importance to future European space efforts. They should enable the European industry to get non-restricted access to high performance technologies that will allow increasing its competitiveness and expertise in the space domain.
         Proposals should include a work package dedicated to the development of a commercial evaluation of the technology, and should address how to access the commercial market with a full range (preload) of recurring products.
         Proposals should improve the overall European space technology landscape and complement the activities of European and national space programmes.
Proposals should ideally include development activities up to space qualification.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The challenge is to enable major advances in space robotic technologies for future on-orbit satellite servicing (robotics and rendezvous), and the exploration of the surfaces of the other bodies in our solar system. The objective is to propose a Programme Support Activity (PSA) for the future implementation of a Strategic Research Cluster (SRC) in Horizon 2020. The overall budget for such an SRC could be in the range of several tens of millions of euros and should achieve an in-orbit demonstration at a significant scale of an autonomous system with key elements for the future sector of on-orbit satellite servicing. This demonstration will be achieved not later than 2023. Further information on the concept of a Strategic research cluster is available from http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/research.
Scope: Driven by the objective of exploring different strategic directions in the European Space Robotics landscape, and having the chance to present different proposals for different scopes for a Robotics SRCs, with different budgetary conditions, the final target of this topic is to increase the competitiveness of the European Space Industry in sectors demanding robotics solutions. This will be done for the benefit of European robotics and clearly defining the spinning-off and spill over effects to other areas of robotic activity on Earth (such as automobile or underwater). In particular, the topic is centred on-orbit satellite servicing (robotics and rendezvous) and planetary surface exploration. The benefit of investing in space robotics technologies for future on-orbit satellite servicing and planetary surface exploration should also be of benefit in sectors as human-robotic partnership, orbital debris removal but would also spin-off in all terrestrial activities where human intervention is impossible or too hazardous (submarine environments; nuclear, biological and chemical industries crisis management, etc.). Therefore, synergies with the current industrial robotics shall be fostered. Spinning-in, i.e., bringing into space innovations originated in other domains, will be also considered, 
At a first stage, the SRC led by this PSA is expected to address robotics issues at two levels: (1) design and manufacturing of reliable and high performance novel robotic building blocks for operation in space environments, and (2) developing really innovative advanced robotic concepts and functions.
The robotic building blocks (1) will likely involve: sensors and actuators, materials and structures, manipulators and tools, hardware and control of robotic systems, processing algorithms; sensor fusion and perception; communications and energy systems.
The robotic concepts and functions (2) are expected to involve several of the following areas: mobility, manipulation, and vision; interoperability with other robots; human-machine co-operation; teleoperations for near Earth locations; partly and highly autonomous operations (in very remote locations that have high Earth communication latencies).
In a second stage, the SRC led by this PSA must have the objective of achieving higher performance and/or lower cost and/or less risk at demonstration level..
As most of the space robotics technologies required are mature enough (with the exception of the autonomous operations that require demonstration and/or validation), particular effort must be made to achieve an effective application of technology, i.e. rigorous systems engineering and system performance analysis, rather than an approach based on pure technology development. To validate the performance of integrated servicing systems three different levels of demonstration can be foreseen: Earth analogues; ISS infrastructure and in-orbit demonstration.
In any case, the final stage of the SRC must involve a space demonstration. However, a validation at the level of a qualification flight for a future mission is not required.
The Commission considers that one proposal requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The initial expected life of the PSA action is 5 years. In this time, the consortium should have delivered: 
         Identification and definition of all the activities required by 2023 to address the challenge of this topic. The contents of the activities must be in agreement with the objectives and boundaries defined in the scope.
         A fully detailed master plan to coordinate all the activities for the whole duration of the SRC.
         A plan for the analysis and evaluation of the results during the execution of the activities within the SRC.
         A plan for the specific exploitation and potential use of the SRC expected outputs.
         A risk assessment and contingency analysis for the SRC.
         The execution of the SRC during a first period of 5 years will assure an advance in European robotics technologies for space: consolidation of building blocks, development of advanced concepts and functions. This will be done with the aim of paving the way for the European activity in areas were robotics are key enabling technologies, such as for example on-orbit servicing, orbital debris removal, autonomous operations in planetary surfaces.
The SRC designed and developed by the PSA is expected to deliver its final results at the end of the H2020 cycle (2023-2024). During its lifetime:
         The SRC shall exploit the potential to generate intense public interest by demonstrating an application (such as satellite repair, refuelling or “cleaning space”, etc.), which citizens can easily relate to.
         Some or all the entities involved in the operational projects of the SRC should be in a privileged position to explore the for-profit viability of some or all the solutions and technologies developed within the SRC.

Specific challenge: The International Space Station (ISS) is the current cornerstone of European activities in human spaceflight and a pillar of the European strategy for space exploration. With its assembly now complete, and with several years of operations ahead until 2020 and possibly beyond, it should be used to the fullest extent for optimising and broadening the scientific, technological and operational return of Europeans investments.

Specific challenge: In-Orbit demonstration/Validation (IOD/IOV) is a unique tool to boost industry’s competitiveness by eliminating the famous “valley of death” and accelerating the deployment of innovative technology.
The challenge in H2020 is to make access to space possible for new technologies and innovations by means of in-orbit demonstrations (IOD) and/or validations (IOV). This maturity level is crucial to enable the competitiveness, non-dependence and innovation of the European space sector. Apart from assessing launching opportunities, platforms and possible upper stages may need to be adapted or developed (complementary to those already existing in Europe) to affordably harness existing European launching capabilities for placing new space products in orbit.
At this initial stage of Horizon 2020 studies are needed to help define the envelope and the requirements for the implementation of affordable missions of IOD/IOV (in combination with the launching system to be selected) within the Horizon 2020 timing and development contexts. This, together with the analysis, design and implementation of the technological elements (platforms, launchers, interfaces, etc.) represents the needed bricks for making this tool available. The IOD/IOV themselves will be addressed in future calls. This call covers only the studies assessing these activities.
Scope: Many of the technologies developed for space will need to be demonstrated in orbit in order to be accepted as new space products. In many cases, in order to be considered for future missions, flight heritage is a requirement, in particular when a high risk is associated with the use of totally new technologies and innovations. It is the intention of the Commission to ensure that at least two opportunities for  IOD/IOV are co-funded during H2020 as a final step in the process of supporting space RTD.
IOD refers to the spaceflight of a scaled version of a particular technology or critical technology subsystem, which would still need further steps to be ready for mission adoption. IOV would already serve as a qualification flight for future missions implementation. Such a successful validation flight of a particular technology would not require any additional space testing before it can be adopted for a specific mission.
The studies should define possible scenarios for one or several future flight opportunities for IOD/IOV of European technology developments (components, payloads, spacecraft subsystems, re-entry vehicles, etc.) and/or innovative system architectures. European technologies are those originated from EU R&D programmes as well as projects financed by ESA, National Space Programmes or European private initiatives (e.g. satellite communications).
The studies will cover proposals for the IOD/IOV platforms in connection with affordable launch systems, with special focus on European launch solutions. A description of the missions to be accomplished, with the resources available to host a/some technological package/s for demonstration are also required together with the first design and implementation of all the elements needed for the mission. The studies will consider different approaches for the platform for the IOD/IOV activities, or adaptation of existing ones such as: dedicated spacecraft, autonomous multiple payload dispenser systems, platforms of standardised parts, segments/rings, upper stages of launchers and re-entry vehicles among others. Proposed solutions should be suitable to recurrently place new space products into orbit to perform relevant missions, and to demonstrate their viability by proving maturity of technology payloads.
The studies will analyse, from a programmatic point of view, the recommended TRL level that the envisaged technologies must have to be demonstrated/validated[1]. An appropriate phasing between the flight opportunities and the technologies to be demonstrated/validated in orbit shall be presented in the studies. The industrial applicability of the technologies in the short/medium term is an important requirement. Other prioritisation criteria will be based on the balance of packages to ensure the maintenance of a relevant number and variety of technologies in order to optimize the IOD/IOV.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 300.000 and 500.000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
           Identification of a portfolio of solutions and opportunities to implement IOD/IOV missions for enabling the flight and operation of innovative space technologies developed in Europe. These solutions will be fully parametrised (technical aspects, implementation of the technologies and the mission, cost, commercial viability).
           Down-selection, within such a portfolio, of those solutions which are suitable for a Horizon 2020 context and are RTD based and innovative.

Specific Challenge: Two specific areas of space science where there is a significant underinvestment when compared to the potential scientific return for Europe are sample curation facility and the exploitation of data of Mars.
One of the main mid-term goals of global space exploration activities is to bring back samples from Mars, asteroids or the Moon. These sample return missions will be developed in the context of ESA programmes or in the international context. However, a European extra-terrestrial sample curation facility will be required in preparation for such missions. The challenge here is to study and map all the aspects required to develop such a facility for all types of samples at the European level, taking into account specificities of receiving potential Moon, Mars and Asteroids samples.
With the highly successful Mars Express mission, launched in 2003, and still operational, Europe firmly established its role on Mars science and exploration. In the last decade an extensive amount of data has been acquired of the atmosphere, surface and sub-subsurface of Mars. The challenge is to fully exploit this data for fundamental scientific purposes, and in preparation for the next set of European Mars missions to be launched in 2016 (ExoMars orbiter and lander) and 2018 (ExoMars rover) and prepare for future Mars missions.
Scope: An action on sample curation facility should aim at guaranteeing terrestrial planetary protection. It should analyse what facilities, analytical methods and instruments, portable receiving facilities for sample transfers, and analogue samples are required in what timeframe. This analysis must take into account specificities of receiving potential Moon, Mars and Asteroid samples in order to adequately serve future sample return mission that will take place with European involvement.
For the exploitation and development of tools for the exploitation of data of Mars for scientific research, and analysis in preparation of the two ExoMars missions the scope is to rely on the data available through the ESA Planetary Science Archive or other means (e.g. instrument teams). Combination and correlation of this data with data from NASA missions is encouraged to further increase the scientific return and to enable new investigations with existing data sets. This includes data from the atmosphere, surface and sub-surface of Mars, as well as data from the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. Enhanced data products would be fed back to the ESA archives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: In the first case, building on existing roadmaps, the action is expected to analyse of opportunities and risks and define further necessary steps, for the implementation of a European extra-terrestrial sample curation facility taking into account specificities of receiving potential Moon, Mars and Asteroids samples.
In the second case proposals are expected to result in scientific publications, open access tools for data use interacting with European archives, and in high-level data products, such as digital maps or atmospheric models, which can be used in the preparation for the operational phases of the ExoMars missions and subsequent missions.

The challenge will however be to allow the European astrophysics community to make the best possible use of those missions by supporting space astronomy observation proposals, using archived data, and making comparisons (including calibrations) between different missions, instruments, and between space and ground-based data. Likewise in comets research the challenge will be to allow the European astronomy community to make the best possible use of the current European mission to a comet (Rosetta), in combination with information from international (e.g. NASA, JAXA) missions and ground-based telescope observations. Europe has also a long experience and deep expertise in planetary missions such as Venus Express, or Cassini-Huygens. The utilisation of data set coming from European and international missions will allow the European planetary community to generate new knowledge and make the best use of past investments. 
Scope: Astrophysics proposals shall make use of, or prepare for the use of ESA astrophysics missions, possible in combination with ground-based observations, and/or data from non-ESA missions (e.g. NASA, JAXA, or other national missions). Comets proposals shall prepare for and make use of the Rosetta mission, possibly in combination with ground-based observations, and/or data from non-ESA missions (e.g. NASA, JAXA, or other national missions). Planetary proposals shall make use of European missions and European instruments on-board international planetary missions and/or data from non-ESA missions (e.g. NASA, JAXA, or other national missions).
These activities shall add scientific value through advanced analysis of the data, leading to scientific publications and higher level data products which can be used by other scientists in their studies. This could be done in combination with the development of open source tools for processing and visualisation of astrophysics, comets or planetary data. Enhanced data products should be suitable for feeding back into the ESA archives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge dedicated to astrophysics, comets or planetary data to be addressed appropriately, including through proposals from small teams. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: A higher number of scientific publications based on Europe’s space data, high-level data products made available through appropriate archives, and tools developed for the advanced processing of data. Proposals are expected also to add value to existing activities on European and international levels, and enhance and broaden research partnerships.

Specific challenge: Europe has a long-standing tradition of international collaboration in space sciences with missions open to international partnerships or by participating to missions of partners (e.g., with USA, Japan, Russia, China, and India). With the increasing international competition in space science Europe should continue to play a leading role in planetary science shaping the research in the field including the elaboration of planetary protection guidelines.
Scope: In line with the objectives of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with space powers active in planetary science. The diverse range of competences spread among universities, research institutes, and space agencies in different countries in the world, should be harnessed in this proposal in view of establishing a coordinated authoritative position in the planetary protection research field. Networking, experts meetings and workshops resulting in recommendations for further action and guidelines for future missions are part of the effort.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: This activity would allow reviewing the planetary protection status of outer Solar System bodies including small Solar System bodies. That may include to establish a new categorisation and the measures that should be taken (or not) to protect them from Earth-sourced biological and organic contamination. Addressing the categorisations of future missions to the outer Solar System and making recommendations will help improving the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) Planetary Protection Policy and help to resolve scientific uncertainties associated with current knowledge. This action should provide the basis for a regular exchange of information on the issue of planetary protection and identify also opportunities for European scientists to participate in future international missions.

","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: In the mid- and long-term the competitiveness of the space sector and its ability to serve the Union's internal and external policies including the Common Security and Defence Policy depends on the continuous incorporation of novel, or even disruptive technologies. The European RTD investment in the field of very low-TRL[1] technologies is to be enhanced. A number of challenges in space technologies have parallels to terrestrial challenges, for example in the fields of aeronautics, energy, environment, ICTs, natural resource exploration, sensors, robotics, advanced materials and production methods, security and health.
Scope: New ideas must be incorporated into the current state of the art. As many advances could come from non-space sectors, such sectors must be actively researched for potential ideas. This should mobilise both traditional space actors and non-space actors, to look for space technologies of the future. The aim of this topic is to attract new actors to space activities and demonstrate technologies that are potentially disruptive, and not only incremental. Such highly innovative technologies should lead to radical improvements in performance, and will enable emerging missions. Drastic improvements in miniaturisation, efficiency, versatility and functionality are expected.
Proposals based on low TRL (1-3) ideas and technologies which could have a final application in future space systems are solicited. The target is to demonstrate these up to TRL 4-5. In this first call, proposals on the fundamental areas of knowledge are foreseen, in which, among others, some of the Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) play a major role. In particular, proposals are sought with relevance for the fields of: ""high-resolution optical and radar observation related technologies (including hyperspectral systems)”, ""radiation-hardened instrument components"", ""in-situ sensors/instruments of physical parameters"", ""technologies for flexible/new generation SatCom payloads"" and ""advanced inter-satellite and/or downlink communications and tracking techniques (RF or Optical)"".
The Commission considers that proposals implemented in less than 24 months and requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Only up to two proposals will be financed on each of the five lines foreseen: ""high-resolution optical and radar observation related technologies (including hyperspectral systems)”, ""radiation-hardened instrument components"", ""in-situ sensors/instruments of physical parameters"", ""technologies for flexible/new generation SatCom payloads"" and ""advanced inter-satellite and/or downlink communications and tracking techniques RF or Optical"".
Expected impact: Spinning-in of new enabling technologies to space systems up to TRL 4-5 and clear indication of the ways in which these technologies can significantly improve performance and/or reduce costs if further developed.
Proposals preferably will mobilise the incorporation of research groups and SMEs without previous experience in space RTD, into the space landscape.
Ideally proposals should result in developments affecting a range of sectors.
Type of action: Research and innovation action.

Within the specific objective to foster policy development, innovation, creativity, audience development and new business and management models through support for transnational policy cooperation, the cross-sectoral strand of the Creative Europe Programme, shall provide support to testing of new and cross-sectoral business approaches to funding, distributing and monetising creation.
A workshop was organized in February 2019 to discuss the scope and main features of a new action codenamed Creative Innovation Lab, put forward by the Commission in the proposal on the Creative Europe regulation post 2020. This action will implement project(s) at the cross roads between different cultural and creative sectors, (including audiovisual), through the use of innovative technologies. It will also foster innovative cross-sectoral approaches and tools to facilitate access, distribution, promotion and monetisation of culture and creativity.
Two calls will test out the concept on a pilot, experimental basis, under the current multiannual financial framework:
- The present Call
- A second Call for proposals to be published once the Work Programme 2020 is adopted.
Innovative technologies can build bridges among different cultural and creative sectors. The role of digital technologies for cultural and creative sector is at the heart of the Commission’s #Digital4Culture strategy. That is the Commission's strategy coupling culture and digital, using the digital potential to empower the positive economic and societal effects of culture.
Digital production and distribution in the age of media convergence is one of the pillars of the strategy. The digital revolution enables the creation of new and innovative artistic creations, but also innovative ways of presenting cultural heritage. In the digital environment, convergence of media – in particular audiovisual – and content is profoundly affecting production and distribution models. By using digital tools (including data and algorithms), the production of culture and creative goods can find new forms of expression, enhance cultural experiences (e.g. in museums and art galleries) and bring about new forms of cooperation among artists and other actors. In turn, culture and the arts can bring in their creativity potential to enhance the innovative capacity of Europe, both for society and industry.
In the light of this, this action will implement project(s) at the cross roads between different cultural and creative sectors (including audiovisual), for instance through the use of innovative technologies, including virtual reality. It will also foster innovative cross-sectoral approaches and tools to facilitate access, distribution, promotion and monetisation of culture and creativity, including cultural heritage.
Support will be given to projects:
a) featuring new forms of creation at the cross roads between different cultural and creative sectors, including the audiovisual sector, and through the use of innovative technologies, including virtual reality,
or
b) fostering innovative cross sectoral approaches and tools to facilitate access, distribution, promotion and/or monetisation of culture and creativity, including cultural heritage.
The focus should be on the following aspects:
problem solving approach and addressing challenges for the cultural and creative sectors;
audiences and the user experience are of paramount importance in scoping the problem;
technology is an enabler in addressing key problems, rather than an objective on its own;
support innovation as regards the creation, distribution and promotion of creative content, addressing cross-sectoral collaboration as well as the use of enabling technologies is also an objective.
For more details please also see the annex to this Call, ""Workshop main conclusions 20th February 2019"" which provides guiding principles."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:
Our dependence on technology continues to grow and, at the same time, the internal complexity of organisations' ICT systems and the external threat environment continue to grow as well and evolve in dynamic and daunting ways.
One approach to cyber security risk management focuses inward on understanding and addressing incidents, vulnerabilities, weaknesses and potential impact. Meanwhile, effective defence against current and future threats requires the addition of a balancing, outward focused approach, on understanding the adversary’s behaviour, capability, and intent.
Those called to deal with incidents or responsible for managing cyber security programmes are often faced with an overwhelming amount of information, often raw and unstructured, to the point where making efficient use of these information flows has become a challenge in itself. Effective decision making may be therefore hampered, especially in times of crisis.
SMEs face a particular challenge seeing as they often do not have the capacity to obtain relevant information or the necessary expertise to analyse it in order to address the cyber security threats they face on their own.
Scope:
Effective decision making, early warning systems and cyber security management requires tools and techniques that enable organisations to efficiently process the flow of information from both internal and external sources, through improved information processing, analysis and, where necessary, exchange; as well as to manage the implementation of cyber security solutions.
The tools and techniques should leverage the state-of-the-art in areas such as SIEM, data analytics (including Big Data) and visualisation, threat intelligence, malware analysis and cyber security information exchange.
Taking into account the large variety of IT systems and architectures in use today, the projects should strive to promote interoperability through the use of globally accepted open standards and wider uptake of any proposed solutions.
Several pilots projects will be supported, for different application areas.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m EUR would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private or public organisations.
With the goal of providing assistance to the private sector (including SMEs), proposals may also address the needs of those entities whose mission it is to assist others such as CSIRTs, national or sector-specific Cyber Security Centres or similar organisations.
Proposals are encouraged to include public security end-users and/or private end users.
Expected impact:
The pilots projects will establish and validate tools and techniques that will facilitate the management of internal and external information sources related to cyber security management.
Through better information management and appropriate dissemination, the actions are expected to lead to more effective vulnerability remediation, enhanced prevention and detection capabilities and faster response to incidents.
Ultimately the actions should aim to reduce the impact of incidents and in particular to increase the level of awareness and preparedness of all stakeholders, public or private, large organisations or SMEs.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to developments up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or above; please see part G of the General Annexes. (Innovation Actions may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication (see Annex D).)“

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Security includes granting access only to the people that are entitled to it. Currently the most widespread approach relies on passwords. Managing the passwords has its limits and poses a challenge to the user, which adds vulnerabilities. Common practice is to use the same or similar password, which increases significantly the risk should the password be broken.
Scope: The focus is on the development and testing of usable, economic and privacy preserving access control platforms based on the use of biometrics, smart cards, or other devices. The solutions are to be installed and tested in a broad-band network, giving access to smart services running over networks with state-of-the-art security, avoiding single points of failure. Proposed work should include the management of the access rights in particular for the service providers, ensure the security and privacy of the databases, facilitate a timely breach notification and remediation to the user, and reduce the insider threat.
The proposed solutions have to guarantee interoperability and portability between systems and services, sparing the user to have to install a platform, service or country specific technology.
Proposed work could assist the objective of implementing a secure information sharing network.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €8m EURO  would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end user alike. Proposals are encouraged to include public security end-users and/or private end users.
Expected impact:
Actions supported under this objective will deliver secure, but user-friendly, access to ICT systems, services and infrastructures, resulting in a consumerisation of devices for access control. The level of security of online services and critical infrastructures protected by these access systems should be demonstratably higher than by the state-of-the-art approach. The proposed solutions are expected to support the creation of commercial services making use of electronic identification and authentication.

","25 March 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:
Communication and computing networks are not only critical infrastructures on their own, but  underpin many other critical networks (e.g. energy, transport, finance, health …). In addition they are critically dependent on ICT technology. Therefore, the malfunctioning or disruption of the communication channel or of an IT system will have a cascading effect, on several other infrastructures or services that depend on it, potentially across all Europe.
This includes Industrial and Automation Control Systems (IACS). They are no longer isolated siloes but are fully integrated with corporate IT infrastructures. Despite this strong connection between the two infrastructures, there is only little awareness regarding IT risks that can affect IACS. An attack to IT assets can spread to the OT environment jumping to SCADA and Control Centres.
Many vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures, including the communication networks, stem from the fact that ICT systems are deployed in an environment or for an application that was not designed with security in mind. The deployment of ICT in new critical systems, including new generation ICT system, is exacerbating the problem by constantly introducing new risks and vulnerabilities, in particular for an interconnected system.
Scope:
Proposals should investigate the dependencies on communication networks and ICT components (including SCADA and IACS systems) of critical infrastructures, analyze and propose mitigation strategies and methodologies for assessing criticalities of services and detecting anomalies, developing tools and processes to simulate or monitor cascading effects due to ICT incidents, and develop self-healing mechanisms. ICT should be protected or re-designed at the software level, but also at the physical level, leading to more robust, resilient and survivable ICT infrastructure.
Based on the outcome of the work described above, plans of how to retrofit state-of-the-art security into networks can also be addressed.
The investigated concepts have to be tested in a field trial. Trials will have to distinguish between generic solutions and solutions specific to the critical infrastructure (e.g. health, finance, energy, transport, …) they are applied to.
Advantage will be taken from the fact that ICT operators (e.g. telecom operators) have experience in securing information networks and this competence can be applied to new types of networks such as smart grids linking communication, energy and transport networks.
In relation to the protection of legacy IACS, SMEs are particularly encouraged to provide specific and very focused security solutions adapting current ICT security technology to IACS environments on topics such as:
Early anomaly detection and compliance management.
Patching and updating equipment without disruption of service and tools.
Improved forensic techniques for supporting criminal law enforcement.
Anti-malware solutions with special focus on managing third-parties (e.g. maintenance and support service providers, IACS vendors, etc.)
Proactive Security Systems able to counteract Denial of Service attacks (distributed or not) and other type of attacks aimed to the IACS network disruption.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €8m EURO  would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Resilient and robust communication networks offering a reduced attack surface to the supported critical infrastructures. Reduced criticality of ICT components installed in critical infrastructures. Increased preparedness, reduced response time and coordinated response in case of a cyber-incident affecting communication and information networks. Reduced possibilities to misuse ICT as a vehicle to commit cybercrime or cyber-terrorism. Where relevant, the supported activities should support the work of the European Program for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP).
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to developments up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL 7) or above; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
""Smart anything everywhere"" stands for the next wave of products that integrate digital technology. The challenge is to accelerate the design, development and uptake of advanced digital technologies by European industry - especially SMEs and mid-caps - in products that include innovative electronic components, software and systems, and especially in sectors where digital technologies are underexploited[1].
Scope:
a. Innovation Actions SAE
As Phase 3 of Smart Anything Everywhere, this sub-topic calls for Digital Innovation Hubs that strengthen European SMEs and mid-caps by experimenting and testing with one or more of the following technologies, or by supporting them to manufacture these products. Projects should also support eco-system building for promising platforms developed in earlier R&I products.
Area 1: Cyber-physical and embedded systems: the goal is to help businesses from any sector uplift the quality and performance of their products and services by including (semi)-autonomy, paying special attention to security and privacy and to the collaboration between humans and machines.
Area 2: Customised low energy computing powering CPS and the IoT: the goal is to help businesses who are developing products for situations where high computing capacity and low energy would be a competitive advantage.
Area 3: Flexible and Wearable Electronics: the goal is to help businesses in further maturing, innovating and validating their products with thin, organic and large area electronics technologies, including wearable, portable and embedded objects. Focus is on i) access to design, technology and prototyping which are ready to use, and ii) application experiments driven by concrete user requirements and business cases.
Area 4: Widening Digital Innovation Hubs: it addresses all three technology areas mentioned above and the technologies addressed in I4MS[2]. It calls for Digital Innovation Hubs in industrial regions which are so far underrepresented in Smart Anything Everywhere and I4MS[3], and builds upon a mentoring programme developed by I4MS[4]. These hubs should strongly collaborate with other Innovation Actions funded under SAE and I4MS, e.g. through joint highly innovative cross-border experiments.
All proposed innovation actions may involve financial support to third parties (typically in the order of EUR 20 000 – 100 000[5] per third party).
For this topic, the four requirements described in the introductory section 'Support to Hubs' have to be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to 8 million would allow all areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one innovation action is supported for each area.
b. Coordination and Support Activities SAE
The action will support the SAE network and help achieve broad coverage in technological, application, innovation, and geographic terms, and to link up with regional/national innovation initiatives, and other Digital Innovation Hubs. Its tasks and services shall include maintaining a single innovation portal, sharing of best practices, dissemination, brokering, leveraging further investment and training. For these support actions, close cooperation with ECSEL, and other CSAs funded under the Digitising European Industry focus area is looked for.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address all of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success when appropriate.
Attract a significant number of new users of advanced ICT in the manufacturing sector, and more innovative technology suppliers, in particular SMEs and mid-caps.
Creation of a sustainable network of Digital Innovation Hubs, providing European added value to investments done at national and regional level in Digital Innovation Hubs.

The challenge is to break ""data silos"" and stimulate sharing, re-using and trading of data assets by launching a second-generation data-driven innovation hub, federating data sources and fostering collaborative initiatives with relevant digital innovation hubs. This shall promote new business opportunities notably for SMEs as part of the Common European Data Space.
All grants under this topic will be subject to Article 30.3 of the grant agreement (Commission right to object to transfers or licensing).
Scope:
This topic calls for Digital Innovation Hubs that strengthen European SMEs and empower European citizens by supporting them to use and combine data sources from different sectors and communities (e.g. retail, tourism, manufacturing, finance and insurance, media, healthcare, consumer support, transport, energy, public administration…) to develop innovative products and services. Special attention should be paid to fostering and facilitating the ""fitness to the market"" of the new solutions and data-driven business concepts, and to introducing best practices to sectors whose business models are not yet data-driven.
Sub-topic 1: Federate and network the relevant actions and initiatives[1], especially digital innovation hubs (including national and regional hubs), that contribute to the creation of a Common European Data Space. Targeted organizations and individuals, especially SMEs, web entrepreneurs and start-ups, will be attracted to use federated data sources (including data platforms), digital infrastructures, tools and methods as accelerators for developing innovative products and services based on data sharing across sectors and borders. The federating hub is expected to run specific communication and training activities (e.g. on tools, data sources and stakeholder needs) and address, where appropriate, data standardization and interoperability issues.
Sub-topic 2: Select, launch and incubate innovation experiments in view of bringing to the market new solutions and services based on secure and trusted data value chains, such as those based on actions resulting from ICT-14-2016-2017 and ICT-18-2016. Appropriate computing infrastructure, tools and support services (e.g. for GDPR compliance and data mentoring) must be made available by the Innovation Actions. Each experiment may involve support to third parties as a mini project following an open call, up to the amount of EUR 120.000[2] for each such project.
Sub-topic 3: Select, launch and incubate innovation experiments for data driven services and tools able to reshape the media value chain, including social media. Experiments should involve one or both of the following aspects:
to explore new ways in which citizens can exploit data to better target and extend the reach of user generated content so as to increase content diversity, transparency and accountability, in a way that enables bottom-up quality journalism, science education or digital democracy.
to explore new ways in which artists and more generally the creative sectors could be integrated in the development of innovative data exploitation for content creation[3].
For both aspects, experiments will consider the application of innovative business models and the necessary aggregation and secure handling of data available from sources such as sensors, observation data, visual data or social media supported by AI systems.

Digital manufacturing platforms play an increasing role in dealing with competitive pressures and incorporating new technologies, applications and services. Advances are needed in digital manufacturing platforms that integrate different technologies, make data from the shop floor and the supply network easily accessible, and allow for complementary applications. The challenge is to fully exploit new concepts and technologies that allow manufacturing companies (especially mid-caps and SMEs) to fulfil the demands from changing supply and value networks.
Scope:
a) Innovation Action - Develop and establish platforms for the connected smart production facilities of the future including their supply chains, driven by EU actors and safeguarding European interest in an area of key importance for the European economy. Proposals need to address at least two industrial sectors with several different use cases, especially in their piloting activities. In accordance with the strategy defined in the multi-annual roadmap[1] of the FoF cPPP, proposals should target at least one of the following ‘grand challenges’:
Agile Value Networks: lot-size one (2018 call)
Excellence in manufacturing: zero-defect processes and products (2018 call)
The human factor: human competences in synergy with technological progress (2019 call)
Sustainable Value Networks: manufacturing in a circular economy (2019 call)
Reference implementations are preferably developed in open-source, with (as far as possible) one permissive open-source licence to be selected for all open-source components. Where applicable, APIs and SDKs are made available to third party developers to develop complementary applications.
For the Innovation Actions in this topic, the four activities and impact criteria as described in the introductory section ‘Platforms and Pilots’ have to be applied. For large-scale piloting and ecosystem building activities, proposals may involve financial support to third parties, as explained in the introductory section ‘Platforms and Pilots’, to support SMEs in piloting and developing prototype applications on top of digital manufacturing platforms.
b) Coordination and Support Activities are needed to cross-fertilise the Industrial Platform communities, allowing for easier take-up of digital technologies from ongoing and past research projects to real-world use cases, and supporting the transfer of skills and know-how between academia and industry in both directions. Coordination and Support Activities are targeted in the 2019 call.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 16 million for Innovation Actions and up to 2 M€ for one CSA would allow the areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one innovation action is supported for each ‘grand challenge’. Maximum one proposal will be selected for the CSA.

With the adoption of the Tallinn Declaration, the ministers in charge of policy and coordination of digital public services in the countries of the EU and EFTA, recognise the needs and expectations of the citizens and businesses when interacting with public administrations and commit that the design and delivery of their services will be guided by the principles of user-centricity[1]
The digital transformation of the public administration shall be implemented at national, regional and local levels.
Scope:
For user-centric digital public services, the proposed action will:
support the implementation of the 'User-centricity principles for design and delivery of digital public services' laid down in the Tallinn Declaration putting citizens truly at the heart of governments' digital transformation at cities and regions level;
encourage and recognise cities and regions that are taking policies steps to become more user-centric;
promote capacity building, best practices and experience exchange, solutions reuse, training, awareness raising through a community building approach;
ensure that the mechanism for recognising user-centric cities and regions and the community will become self-sustainable beyond the H2020 funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of 1.5M€ would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will show the social and human dimension of digitalisation, in particular that all citizens can be better served by their public administrations while moving into the digital age, and will strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the European Union.
By developing a framework that will determine the conditions by which cities and regions will be recognised in their commitment to become more user centric the belief is that across Europe public administrations will be inspired to accelerate their journey to design and deliver more user-centric digital public services for the benefit of their citizens and businesses.
The action should emphasise the movement of local and regional administrations towards citizen centric, secure, high quality and burden free public services and towards more inclusive and participative decision and policy-making. At the same time cities and regions will gain visibility and benefit from being part of the community through exchange of good and bad practices, solutions and know how among all cities and regions experiencing the same journey.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Agricultural research and innovation supports the sector in coping with a complex mix of challenges it is facing, including for example the pressures on natural resources and farm revenues. Knowledge creation and accessible information systems and tools to monitor, gather, transform and above all share vital information between key stakeholders can help the sector to become more sustainable. However, as well as the potential for new knowledge, a substantial part of the existing knowledge and its underpinning information flows, has yet to be exploited to its full potential. The resulting performance gap has strong social, ecological and economic implications. An improved functioning of the agricultural knowledge and innovation systems is needed, for timely innovation and to speed up the rate of knowledge creation. One of the most important constraints concerns the limited interoperability and lack of openness of different technical systems, thus limiting the choices farmers can make between suppliers of new technologies. An enhanced interoperability would allow for increased data sharing and the resulting knowledge generation. Another main constraint is the lack of information on the effectiveness of new technologies which slows down their take up.
Scope:
Pilots should address all of the below aspects:
Building platforms integrating different technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) devices, cloud, photonics, networks, geolocalisation (including through Galileo and EGNOS (the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service)) and robotics combined with applications based on data analytics and knowledge management. There is a need for a wide adoption of open, interoperable standards to ensure that all connected systems can talk to each other, allowing the farmers and relevant other stakeholders to pick and choose the most appropriate combination of tools from different suppliers. Pilots will validate the means to achieve high level of interoperability of different systems through reference architecture, semantics technologies and standardisation framework that demonstrate communication exchange of data across different systems and platforms.
Sharing data and generating knowledge via capturing and translating more and precise information. High precision data capturing and a high degree of data sharing should serve as basis for decision support systems delivering tailored advice at farm level, complementing and/or extending advisory services. The core technical enablers for analysing the amounts of data will be low-maintenance, robust and scalable monitoring and communication systems as well as artificial intelligence and semantics technologies. These services should include direct and detailed feedback to the farmers on appropriate practices and management strategies.
Developing decision support systems that will include, but are not restricted to, a benchmarking system on the productivity and sustainability performance of farms, services, technologies and practices. For this purpose data models and semantic standards need to be defined to elicit performance indicators and derive decision making, as well as allowing sharing the data from the different farms.
Pilots in the selected areas should clearly cover the supply and demand sides. For large-scale piloting and ecosystem building, projects in this topic may involve financial support to third parties to extend the digital innovation space for farmers, advisory services and innovators, based on a network of farms and in close cooperation with existing agricultural knowledge and innovation infrastructures of the different Member States and Associated Countries and regions. For farmers, the platforms should have a mass-tailored advisory and knowledge dissemination service, including economic and technical benchmarking. It shall cover a large number of farms, including small farms. Advisory services based on local eco-systems should be investigated and linked in the pilots. For innovators, the platforms should work as test-bed, testing and benchmarking new technologies and services. This should be made possible by allowing for recruiting pilot farms and/or making available the necessary data.
Proposals should fall under the concept of multi-actor approach[1] and allow for strong involvement of the farming sector in the proposed activities. Projects are required to develop adequate data governance model(s) defining the terms for access to data owned by another party. Activities should allow for a wide geographic coverage within Europe. In addition, proposals shall cover at least three sub-sectors (e.g. arable crops, livestock, vegetable and fruit production).
For this topic, the four activities and impact criteria described in the introductory section 'Platforms and Pilots' have to be applied. Pilot projects are expected to contribute to the consolidation and coherence work that will be implemented by the CSA supporting the activities defined under the topic ""DT-ICT-13-2019: Digital Platforms/Pilots Horizontal Activities"".
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 15 million would allow the areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrate measureable benefits from intensified data and information flows across a wide range of farm types, notably small farms;
Improved and inclusive information flows and management within and among the targeted agricultural sectors based on transparent and fair data governance practices;
Identification of user needs, validation of user acceptance, especially demonstration of viable concepts addressing privacy, security, vulnerability, liability and trust in connected data spaces;
More information on environmental, social and economic performance of technologies, practices and management, increasing their respective adoption;
Creation of opportunities for entrepreneurs by promoting new market openings, providing access to valuable datasets and direct interactions with users, expanding local businesses to European scale;
Exploration and validation of new industry and business processes and innovative business models validated in the context of the pilots.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Rural areas represent most of Europe's territory (91%) and population (59%). When measuring against socio-economic indicators rural areas tend to lag behind urban areas. Lower population and business density make it more challenging to develop private businesses and public services in rural areas.
Rural areas are key to solve many of the big societal challenges such as climate change or the sustainable provision of food, biomass and energy. European rural areas are places of great assets and they can become more attractive if the provision of jobs, basic services, including health and care, connectivity, smart transport, and energy solutions, as well as a favourable climate for entrepreneurship, are ensured. Among the priorities to be addressed, overcoming the digital divide between rural and urban areas and developing the potential offered by increased connectivity and digitisation of rural areas must receive particular attention.
In particular, one key challenge is to overcome the barrier of missing interoperability of smart object platforms and service platforms that share and exploit data between them. This should trigger the emergence of a dynamic rural ecosystem, which in turn can lead to the development of cross-platform applications that ultimately contribute to increasing economic growth in rural areas and support their contribution to tackling societal challenges.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to develop and demonstrate cost-efficient and flexible cross-domain applications through large-scale pilots. These should build on an open, API-based, interoperable and federated IoT architecture and include a reference implementation supporting flexible integration of heterogeneous services. Pilots should bridge the interoperability gap of the smart object platforms and create markets for service - and application providers as well as platform operators, supported by a vibrant ecosystem of developers, service providers and user communities.
In developing the pilots, proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:
The integration of data and information across different platforms for sustainable and efficient service provision, where appropriate based on Artificial Intelligence. The approach should showcase platform interoperability in line with relevant standards.
To develop an open marketplace with an open application interface for cross-cutting services to cater for new business opportunities
Reference implementations including proof-of-concept, large-scale demonstrations and validation leveraging on platforms developed elsewhere
To create innovation ecosystems based on ‘Platforms for Connected Smart Objects and Services’, to support citizens and businesses for a multiplicity of novel applications.
The development of pilots demonstrating benefits, cost-efficiency, flexibility and realistic business models required in rural areas around existing infrastructure, and to utilise links to other European, national or private funding sources to leverage infrastructure delivery.
Potential application areas could include one or more of the following: public services, energy, autonomous robotics transport, logistics, education, tourism, health and care. The applications should support the implementation of the smart villages concept[1] oriented towards relatively underdeveloped and remotely located rural areas and communities. Innovative and technical inspiration could be sought in previous work in the following domains: smart cities, smart living and ageing well, smart - and/or social farming, forest management, distributed energy, smart logistics and mobility and e-governance.
Pilots should follow an evolutionary agile, well-delineated, and lean approach. The developed platforms should be concurrently validated in at least three large-scale regional pilots in rural settings involving partners with strong relation to public authorities. The Pilots should propose scalable technical solutions capable of meeting social and economic targets relevant to boost new rural services and business.
Key performance indicators should be defined to measure progress on citizen's benefits in rural areas, quality of life, economic growth, job creation, new business development etc.
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties, particularly for SMEs. Conditions for third parties support are set out in Part K of the General Annexes. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support will be granted. Maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The respective options of Article 15.1 and Article 15.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The development of the pilots should follow a participatory approach using where appropriate well-functioning existing societal groups (including for example Local Actions Groups, Rural networks, public administrations responsible for Rural Development Policies) and liaise with territorial digital dynamic development. Proposal should develop strategic approaches that will help policy makers, rural actors, citizens and project promoters on the ground to deliver results, considering the comparative strengths and needs of their respective territory, to improve the implementation of EU policies in rural areas. When necessary, internet providers should be involved in the project to ensure connectivity, which is a prerequisite for rural ICT exploitation.
For this topic, the four activities described in the introductory section 'Platforms and Pilots' must be applied. Pilot projects are expected to contribute to the consolidation and coherence work that will be implemented by the CSA supporting the activities defined under the topic ""DT-ICT-13-2019: Digital Platforms/Pilots Horizontal Activities"".
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposal requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
For this topic, the impact criteria described in the introductory section 'Platforms and Pilots' have to be applied in addition to as many as possible contributions to the following impact criteria:
Validate the brokerage platforms illustrated by an increase of cross-cutting applications and services
Demonstrate and show-case cross-sectorial platforms interoperability.
Demonstrate the benefits of data sharing across platforms from different sectors.
Exploration and validation of new industry and business processes and innovative business models validated in the context of the pilots.
Overcome the digital divide between rural and urban areas, and to develop the potential offered by connectivity and digitisation of rural areas.
Improve quality of life in rural areas, higher standard of living and services for citizens.
Creation of opportunities for entrepreneurs, notably SMEs, by promoting new market openings, providing access to valuable datasets and direct interactions with users, creating new businesses in rural areas.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European health and care systems face a number of challenges linked to the ageing of the population and an increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions. With budget constraints, the health and care systems face rising cost pressures for systems and problems of sustainability. There is a consensus that health systems need to undergo adaption if they are to adequately respond to future population health needs.
New digital technologies will play a role in transforming health and care systems. In particular, artificial intelligence and robotics, have the potential to transform health and care facilities across their range of functions from the clinical aspects (screening and prevention, diagnosis, treatment, surgical support) to organisational and logistical aspects (such as the management and distribution of medicines and wider supplies across the facility). Given that health facilities such as hospitals consume the major proportion of resources available to health and care budgets, efficiency gains in these facilities may support sustainability of the system as a whole.
Innovative AI based systems (robotics, big data, machine learning, autonomous systems, conversational agents, etc.) have shown considerable promise so far, however their effective use in the delivery of health and care depends on their successful integration (and acceptation) within existing health and care facilities such as hospitals, primary care centres and care homes.
Therefore, piloting at scale is needed to prove the transformative impact of AI. Pilots need to be embedded in operational health and care settings and built around well specified open physical and digital[1] platforms that are able to demonstrate operational and economic benefits sufficient to justify wider uptake by health and care policy makers.
AI in this context has the potential to deliver integrated physical and digital services that address a wide range of healthcare applications, for example in patient care, diagnosis, treatment and in hospital based laboratory and support services. Ethical, privacy and trust aspects should be addressed, as appropriate.
Scope:
Devise in-facility pilot demonstrators that deliver innovative AI-based solutions in a health and care setting such as a hospital, primary care facility or care home. Pilots should enable or support clinical, diagnosis and treatment, etc. carried out with clinical outcomes comparable to human delivered procedures and with comparable results.
Proposals may address any aspect of health facility operations across their range of functions, such as diagnostics, treatments, logistical aspects, etc. Proposals must indicate how their proposed solution will perform when measured against particular health and care metrics suitable for the aspect of operations chosen. Proposal should be developed with health and care facility partners and consider wider dimensions such as how they will work within the broader aspects of impact on resources, staff training and alignment with existing practice. The deployed solutions should build AI-based systems that combine digital and physical services that support individualised and integrated care solutions in care facilities, such as hospitals, clinics, primary care centres, rehabilitation centres, care homes, etc..
Proposals must clearly demonstrate, in context, the integration of autonomous smart components unpinning AI that physically affect the working environment together with those that gather and process data and must clearly show how, in a health and care context, direct and positive impact on effectiveness and efficiency are expected to be achieved.
Proposals must integrate health and care partners in the design of the pilot, the development of performance indicators, as well as to allow access to the relevant operational environment.
Proposals must demonstrate likely “at scale” benefits in efficiency or cost reduction and demonstrate the effectiveness of any novel service models in providing economic justification for scale-up investment. Proposals should also identify opportunities for the development of European standards that enable wide spread adoption and new market creation.
Privacy and cybersecurity issues, including security by design and data integrity should also be addressed, where appropriate.
Proposals must seek to align with the European Digital Innovation Hub networks and platforms funded under DT-ICT-02-2018: Robotics - Digital Innovation Hubs (DIH).
When assessing proposals, the Commission will take into account the value of having a spread of projects addressing different health and care functions (for instance, surgery, rehabilitation, logistics in hospital, etc.).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 7 and 10 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Emergence of European-led AI based pilots for the smart hospital of the future, enabled by open system platforms
Demonstration of effectiveness, in use, of AI based technologies, such as smart robots, in a range of healthcare tasks
Engagement of healthcare policy makers, investors, stakeholders and through the pilot.
Effective basis for developing deployable applications

Tomorrow's energy grids consist of heterogeneous interconnected systems, of an increasing number of small-scale and of dispersed energy generation and consumption devices, generating huge amounts of data. The electricity sector, in particular, needs big data tools and architectures for optimized energy system management under these demanding conditions.
Scope:
Innovation Actions targeting large-scale pilot test-beds for big data application in the energy sector. The aim is to develop/pilot and deploy a reference architecture for large-scale multi-party data exchange, management & governance and real-time processing (including distributed/edge processing) in the energy sector and to translate this reference architecture into an open, modular data analytics toolbox for the safe and effective operation of grids and provision of innovative energy services. The reference architecture should ensure compatibility with legacy formats, interfaces and operating systems of the energy system, allow replication and scale-up, be compliant with applicable EU standards, and should enable the integration of relevant digital technologies like IoT, AI, cloud and big data services. The analytics toolbox shall be able to handle a wide variety of data and support the development of a wide range of energy services, at least to increase the efficiency and reliability of the operation of the electricity network (e.g. by predictive maintenance), to optimize the management of assets connected to the grid (in particular small-scale/renewable electricity generation and those used for demand response), to increase the efficiency and comfort of buildings, and to de-risk investments in energy efficiency (e.g. by reliably predicting and monitoring energy savings). Proposers should demonstrate that they have access to appropriate large-scale and realistic datasets, and should involve as many as necessary of the following types of participants: network operators, suppliers, independent aggregators, ESCO's, power exchanges, building management and renovation sectors, software integrators/developers. Proposals should address, as appropriate, analytics, simulation, prediction, cloud computing. Projects shall collaborate with EU-funded projects through the BRIDGE initiative [1].
For this topic, the four activities and impact criteria described in the introductory section 'Platforms and Pilots' have to be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around 10 million EUR would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
All grants under both subtopics will be subject to Article 30.3 of the grant agreement (Commission right to object to transfers or licensing).
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success where appropriate:
Effective integration of relevant digital technologies in the energy sector, resulting in integrated value chains and efficient business processes of the participating organizations;
Enhancing energy asset management, increasing consumer participation and innovative network management, creating new data-driven business models and opportunities and innovative energy services;
Contribution to increasing the use of renewable energy and increased energy efficiency based on optimised energy asset management, offering access to cheaper and sustainable energy for energy consumers and maximising social welfare;
New data-driven paradigms for energy management systems able to deal with increased complexity of the energy systems;
Improving availability of big data and big data management & analysis facilities for real-life scale research, simulation and test purposes.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
When energy production is becoming decentralised and ICT is increasingly present in homes, the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and promotion of energy efficiency should benefit from smarter homes, buildings and appliances, as well as (the batteries in) electric vehicles. Smart homes and buildings are one crucial element because system integration and optimisation of distributed generation, storage and flexible consumption will require interoperable smart technologies installed at building level. Internet of Things (IoT) enables a seamless integration of home appliances with related home comfort and building automation services allowing to match user needs with the management of distributed energy across the grid, and to gain access to benefits from Demand Response. Novel services should lead to more comfortable, convenient and healthier living environment at lower energy costs for consumers whilst enabling an active participation of consumers in the energy system and energy markets.
Scope:
The aim of the pilot is to exploit IoT reference architectures models that allow for combining services for home or building comfort and energy management, based on platforms that enable the integration of relevant digital technologies like IoT, AI, cloud and big data services and where applicable, combined with blockchain technologies. Energy services, where appropriate, can be combined with additional non-energy services and foster the take-up of smart energy communities (in particular peer-to-peer energy markets). The aim is also to demonstrate platforms through a large-scale pilot for experimentation and co-creation with users under real-life conditions in interaction with the electricity and wider energy system, and to demonstrate the benefits of energy management through IoT application and services for the users. The envisaged architecture should allow for third party contributions that may lead to new value added services both in energy and the home/building domain.
This shall be done by developing interoperability and seamless data sharing, through aligning existing standards from the utility and ICT domains, across the devices and systems to enable innovative building energy management services, with the aim to save costs to consumers, to facilitate the integration of renewable energy from distributed intermittent sources and to support energy efficiency. The pilot needs to demonstrate plug-and-play energy management solutions within the home, by taking into account legacy of existing smart home or building solutions, mapping their approach to common architecture models and implementing relevant standards (such as SAREF). Pilots need to ensure interoperability in the communication interfaces between smart devices and from the smart device to the gateway/energy manager and/or to the cloud, i.e. a service provider that uses the data generated from the device, so that smart home services can also be used for the benefit of the electricity and wider energy system. Selected pilots should promote the use of these interoperable solutions as widely as possible involving many different types of appliances (e.g. including white-goods, heating, cooling and ventilation, home & building automation energy management, metering and control, batteries, photovoltaic panels, charging for electric vehicles), and explore the need for further standardisation and legislation. Pilot work plans should include feedback mechanisms from the users to allow adaptation and optimisation of the technological and business approach to the particular use case.
The selected large-scale pilot shall in particular address all of the following issues:
demonstrate scalability and stimulate spill-over effects; demonstrate that such platforms lead to a marketplace for new services in EU homes and buildings; identify best-practices, inter alia for consumer involvement, in installation, and in sales packages of devices and services;
for large-scale piloting and ecosystem building, proposals shall involve financial support to third parties, in particular SME's and start-ups, to support the incorporation of users of the pilots, developers of additional applications, replication of the pilots through new sites or new connected devices, and complementary assessment of the acceptability of the use case where appropriate;
the selected project shall cover the whole value chain for IoT-based services: appliance manufacturers and technology providers, ICT suppliers, energy suppliers, as well as independent aggregators or energy service companies (ESCOs), and one or more grid service operators (transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs));
the selected project is expected to contribute to the consolidation and coherence work in cooperation with similar EU-funded projects[1] through the BRIDGE initiative [2] and the CSA supporting the activities defined under ""DT-ICT-13-2019: Digital Platforms/Pilots Horizontal Activities a)"" below by contributing their results of horizontal nature (interoperability approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.);
link with Member States' and Associated Countries' initiatives in this area.
For this topic, the four activities and impact criteria described in the introductory section 'Platforms and Pilots' have to be applied. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 30 million for Innovation Actions would allow the areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increasing number of energy apps/services and home devices and appliances that are connected through the Internet allowing to shift consumption according to wholesale market or grid-constraints-related price signals.
Validation of user acceptance, as well as demonstration of viable concepts that ensure privacy, liability, security and trust in connected data spaces.
Accelerated wider deployment and adoption of IoT standards and platforms in smart homes and buildings in Europe and development of secure, cost-effective and sustainable European IoT ecosystems and related business models.
Demonstration that such platforms lead to a marketplace for new services in EU homes and buildings with opportunities also for SMEs and start-ups.

Process Industries are becoming increasingly digitised. The development of devices, sensors and actuators, connected through the internet of things, allows machines to acquire capabilities such as identifying and optimising solutions, or making complex decisions. Enormous amounts of data are being generated but are typically exploited locally, for a unique purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) is acknowledged as a key enabling technology but its actual potential is much more vast than the current state of the art in industrial applications suggest.
Scope:
The Coordination and Support Action should identify, based on a mapping of digital technologies in process industries and their level of penetration, which specific AI- and big data technologies are most relevant, and what are, or could be, the most relevant application cases and/or pilots in process industry. A roadmap should be developed for all the different sectors in the process industries to take full advantage of AI and big data and give clear and pragmatic recommendations for researchers, managers, and operators planning to harness their potential.
The roadmap should explore, inter alia, actions on:
Research and innovation management, planning, and design (e.g. new chemical synthesis strategies, health and safety assessments);
Process control: yield and accuracy enhancement;
Supply chain management and scheduling of connected processes, plants and/or sites (e.g. for industrial symbiosis), process flexibility;
Predictive maintenance;
Product customisation and product traceability.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.4 and 0.6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

The present call is for a Coordination and Support Action to support the Lighthouse Initiative in establishing the Lighthouse and its coordination with amongst other national activities in the field.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at coordinating the relevant stakeholders, project consortia, as well as policy makers, in full collaboration with the LIASE, addressing all of the following:
Establish a communication platform for all stakeholders;
Promote the objectives of the Lighthouse Initiative;
Facilitate connections between the stakeholders;
Help shaping the Lighthouse Initiative during and beyond H2020;
Organise outreach events;
Facilitate dialogue between all stakeholders;
Help the networking of respective national and international activities in the field.
It is expected that such an activity is driven by a consortium led by organisations that are active in the field and have experience in coordination and support activities in the context of ECS (electronic components and systems).
Expected Impact:
The following impacts are expected to be addressed:
A goal-driven, federated effort towards a challenging industrial vision to generate European leadership in Electric, Connected and Automated driving, and a strong potential for longer term technological innovation and economic exploitation.
Involvement and commitment from key stakeholders.
Increased transnational collaboration between the relevant European initiatives in the field.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Modern forces rely on various systems and platforms (e.g. satellites, aircrafts, UAVs (Unmanned air vehicles), ships, ground vehicles) that generate massive data (i.e. big data) from different sensor/effector types and timeframes (e.g. real-time fluxes, weekly data reports, reactive acquisition missions). In addition, specific domains (Such as maritime surveillance) may also collate open data to flesh out mobiles identification.
The growing amount of data may offer the opportunity of a more efficient use of assets provided that processing tools, customized for existing communication links, are able to extract relevant information from data sources.
This call aims at helping the operator to leverage multi-source intelligence (multi-INT) data in large collections of data.
AI techniques should be looked upon with attention, as it may offer a significant potential to provide solutions maximizing performance at minimal cost. It is required to select different AI techniques most suited to the behaviour of the process being optimized.
Traceability and responsibility have also to be addressed properly within a supervised approach and black boxes components have to be minimized. Furthermore, vulnerabilities and potential failures have to be dealt with.
Scope:
The proposals must address or contain description of:
functional analysis of typical scenarios covering both areas:
situational awareness and decision making support;
planning.
fieldable concept that enables the use/implementation of AI techniques, among which, but not limited to, machine learning and neural networks, mixed with other typical AI paradigms (inferential engines, fuzzy logic);
algorithm prototyping, implementation and verification, including the data sets and metrics to be used to do so;
tools development including algorithm insertion and demonstration (PoC[1]);
concepts[2] of AI-based applications’ store for end-users.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study, design, prototyping and testing of the AI-based technologies and solutions (e.g. System of systems/Subsystem of systems PoC).
These activities must in particular include:
identification of feasible use cases and related requirements definition for AI-based application contexts;
scouting of contemporary technology that can support agile design and implementation activities;
collection of data representative of the use cases;
implementation of verification metrics (scenario simulation using the collected data);
implementation of technology demonstrator(s);
verification of the technology demonstrator(s) through simulation of scenarios.
Main high-level requirements
Tools associated to the different scenarios (use cases) should be developed:
addressing properly traceability and responsibility in the design and development activities;
giving clear view of cyber vulnerabilities and potential failures.
The following requirements should be fulfilled:
For task 1 relating to situational understanding and pictures
The operator should be assisted by the tool through both precise information that it has inferred from data and high-level representations, in order to facilitate quick grasp of the situation;
The tool should be multi-INT in that it infers the best possible information from all possible sources, including but not limited to:
non sensitive ISR data from a wide variety of sensors/vectors;
current and past mission data;
history of events and operator decisions;
open-source data from structured databases as well as unstructured in-the-wild data (e.g. social networks).
The tool should be agnostic to specific sources of data;
The tool should propose acquisition missions with existing means, whenever it judges it provides the best complement of information;
The tool should be non-exclusive, in the sense that lack of some of the usual sources does not prevent information inference (only degrades it);
The tool should provide short-term information, such as current interest events as well as predicted situations (e.g. locations and dates of predictable events)
For task 2 relating to mean-of-effect optimization
The operator should be assisted by the tool in selecting an effector or a combination of effectors thereof to best handle the mission at hand;
The tool should be able to provide lists of possible solutions to mission events occurrence for operator choice and consider returning feedback to improve tool’s knowledge base;
The tool can require some manual filling of effector characteristics, but should infer, at minimal performance drop, the missing parameters (based on similarity with other systems, for instance).
For all of these contexts of use, it is important to have “trustable” or “explainable” tools. This means for AI-based capabilities to minimize as far as possible the use of black boxes, which should only be allowed for low level components or to perform extensive testing of those black boxes (e.g. in case of machine learning). This allows having the decision making rationale, as well as offering evolution traceability, at capability level.
Expected Impact:
Presence in the system of innovative techniques that support the operators in some of their most critical functions, offload them (relief from manual operations), thereby maintaining their analytical ability to operate as supervisors;
Mark the difference between commercial use of the AI and military use of the AI (inter alia: attention to traceability and responsibility);
Improvement of the reaction time for mission deployment by AI-supported decision-making;
Cost and availability gains by optimizing the means-of-effect;
Increase of the overall system performance as new technologies will give better results in terms of total defence effectiveness;
Enabler for rapid integration of multiple data sources to support field and based personnel using deployable machine learning and AI models;
A validation approach that ensures the correct use of AI models in mission critical contexts;
A set of standards’ proposals that allows multi-national collaboration and sharing of machine learning models for military use;
Big data management and congruent pattern identification;
Increase the European technological sovereignty in the field of AI for defence applications.

The objective of this topic is to develop medical counter-measures (MedCM) for EU military forces to face current and emerging CBRN threats (mainly of biological and chemical nature).
It thus aims at developing common and shared capabilities for EU military against chemical/biological crisis generated by a natural or provoked event and at treating pathologies or injuries of significant impact. It will thus contribute to respond more efficiently to external conflicts and crises.
Such medical counter-measures are currently poorly studied by both academia and industry within the EU due to:
their specificity;
the large funding to be engaged for R&D;
the low occurrence of such threats even though they are proliferating worldwide (thus increasing operational risks for military forces);
current EU regulations on medicines.
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of medical counter-measures (MedCMs) against the chemical, bacteriological and radiological threats listed in the main high-level requirements below.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the design, prototyping and testing of one or several MedCMs, not excluding upstream or downstream activities.
Compared with the development of a standard medicine these activities must be understood as:
design: preclinical, in vitro studies;
prototyping: preclinical, in vivo studies (The data or information on the kinetics and pharmacodynamics of the product or other relevant data or information, in animals and primates, will allow selection of an effective dose in humans);
testing: clinical, phase I studies (Phase II and III clinical studies are considered as “qualification” and marketing authorisation is considered as “certification”).
The targeted activities must in particular include:
the evaluation of state-of-the-art research in order to identify best MedCM candidates;
the definition of preclinical studies to be performed to develop the best therapeutic or prophylactic candidates;
the realisation of preclinical studies;
the realisation of phase I clinical studies;
the building of relevant documentation for marketing authorization based on the former activities.
Main high-level requirements
The proposed MedCMs should fulfil the following requirements:
1. General
Efficacy of the MedCMs should be demonstrated on relevant animal models as close as possible as humans during preclinical studies, according to the recommendations of national or European regulatory agencies;
Innocuity should be demonstrated on human volunteers during phase I clinical trials;
The final product is to be administered by medical personnel, at medical treatment facilities.
2. Chemical threat
To develop an efficient MedCM against severe poisoning by any nerve agent or organophosphorus pesticide with, for example, a stoichiometric bioscavenger isolated from human plasma such as human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzyme from the IV-4 Cohn plasma fraction.
3. Biological threat
To develop an efficient MedCM against toxins poisoning or any B agent for which classical treatments (e.g. antibiotics) are not available with for example immunotherapy.
4. Radiological threat
To develop an efficient radionuclides chelator to treat internal or external radiological contamination of personnel.
Expected Impact:
Provide EU military forces with consistent CBRN medical protections against a large panel of threats;
Facilitate the development of CBRN defence capabilities that each Member State or individual government or industry cannot face solely;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This topic intends to develop a system in pod to be used by EU air platforms in contested electromagnetic environment. Interoperability and cross-domain operations shall be part of the solution.
The proliferation of advanced long-range Integrated Air Defence Systems (IADS), incorporating threats that can operate across different frequency bands and attack aircraft at ranges up to 400 km, could create Anti Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) areas. In such A2/AD areas, air power cannot operate or be projected in case of conflict. In particular, access to large swaths of territory over EU nation’s airspace could be denied in case of a conflict. The only effective way for Europe to counteract these air defence means is to have a capability of Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA), able to create a safe bubble around the formation of aircrafts.
From the operational perspective, the AEA capability must find, locate and track Electro Magnetic (EM) threats and deliver high power jamming signals in the full Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum used in military operations.
Currently the EU capability in countering these threats is limited to few platforms and, when needed, most of the required capability is provided by NATO allies. The EU Capability Development Plan (CDP) also identifies electronic attack as one of the priority areas for development.
EU therefore needs to catch up with emerging Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies to enable aircrafts to operate into the danger zones created by advanced air defence systems, in order to operate its air power from within its own territories as well as in vital geographical areas.
The EU industries have traditionally been developing advanced capabilities in the field of EW, but not at the level required by an electronic attack system, limiting the strategic autonomy of Europe for this critical capability.
Scope:
This topic invites to launch the development a European electronic attack system that will remove the above-mentioned limitations. This capability will allow European and NATO air forces to safely operate within EU territories and to safely project force in other potential areas of operations. The system shall be interoperable with the existing and planned Member States assets and in cross-domain operations.
Proposals shall address design, development and testing of an escort/modified escort-jamming capability that will be based on state-of-the-art existing technological cores at European industries level.
The system should follow a modular development approach, being pod mounted in order to be compatible with different aircrafts of interest for the Member States (manned and unmanned).
The Electronic Attack pod mounted system shall implement a highly efficient phased array based jamming system with powerful, efficient and wideband Gallium-Nitride (GaN) technology.
The goal of the system is to enable a platform for Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) missions that could adapt to the latest in EW requirements, which include (soft) suppression of enemy air defences, escort/modified-escort role, non-traditional electronic attack, self-protected/time-critical strike support, and continuous capability enhancement.
Such features shall rely on the ability to locate, record, replay, and jam hostile communications while tracking across an extremely broad frequency range. Maintaining the ability to communicate with allied forces while operating jamming electronics is another critical requirement.
The escort system would be able to mask an entire fleet of airships from a medium to long range.
The system shall be designed to break the acquisition cycle of radar installations since the search or early-warning phase of detection. S-band radar installations are the threat most often considered, as they are used in most Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) systems and other Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) systems.
The presence of threats in the Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) to X-band range, and their spread in operational frequency and instantaneous bandwidth shall also be considered.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover at least:
Concept of operations (CONOPS) definition, system specification, Detailed Requirements Review (DRR) and architecture definition.
Detailed design of the pod air system, including the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR).
The proposals could also include the development of small-scale technological demonstrators in order to support decision making during the design phase.
The project will take into account specific requirements from Member States associated to each of the selected air vehicle platforms, in order to perform a design compatible with them, up to the maximum extent possible.
A detailed planning of the subsequent project phases shall be generated, including the identification of implementation priorities according to operational needs of the Union and Member States. Subsequent phases up to operational readiness shall include in particular: prototypes development, qualification and test activities, to reach incremental operational capabilities.
Main high-level requirements:
The proposed system shall be based on a phased array architecture with full 360° EW support capability. The system will use the electronic scan nature of this architecture to contend with numerous radar systems.
The proposed system shall have very high ERP (Effective Radiated Power) effective in all radar polarizations to perform standoff jamming and escort jamming. The frequency coverage shall be valid for electronic attack against air surveillance, target tracker, target indication airborne or ground radars.
The waveforms generation by the system shall be able to perform any radar waveform including continuous wave signals.
The system shall be able to detect and perform tracking passively against any radar emission.
The system shall be able to generate waveforms to perform deception to these radars. Specifically, the system will focus in the capability of reprogramming waveforms to adapt to existing and future threats. An effective air operation can need the use of close-in jamming actions by means of UAV (RPAS) swarms. The system shall be able to control the electronic attack operation of the swarm so performing coordinated electronic attacks. The capability to deliver cyber payload shall also be taken into consideration.
At the same time, the system will increase back-end system capability with highly sophisticated computer control along with rapid re-programmability and all EW managing functions.
The system shall offer additional unconventional functionalities: coordinated electronic attack (i.e. cooperative jamming) and precise geolocation and targeting.
Expected Impact:
To develop a European electronic attack capability at system level operable from air vehicles. This capability would allow EU air forces to conduct operations in contested EM environment, to deal with low-frequency radars and to counter new sophisticated threats;
To identify and assure that all key strategic components for this capability are under the sovereignty of EU industry;
To contribute to the development and competitiveness of EU industries worldwide by incorporating key EW components and systems currently leaded in the market by non-EU industries. To minimize the design and development efforts that would need to be spent separately by EU industries and, consequently, to allow these industries to sooner reach the market and satisfy the requirements of Member States’ armed forces in the field of electronic attack;
To increase commonality on EW systems, in the area of electronic attack, along the Member States’ armed forces, by joining efforts on this area."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Theatre of an unprecedented strategic and military competition, space is likely to become a new confrontation frontline in the near future. Easier access to space, increased space debris in orbit, the existence of large space objects capable of offensive actions imply the necessity for Member States to acquire or upgrade capabilities to protect their countries and strengthen their role as sovereign powers.
The 2018 Capability Development Plan (CDP) points to a shortfall in the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and early warning domain and identifies the need of an essential capability for securing Member States by preventing natural and manmade threats.
As a prerequisite for further defence cooperation in space, Member States should be able to reach a shared comprehension of what is happening in space.
A European military Space Surveillance Network (SSN) and SSA Command and Control (SC2) system are recognized as peculiar solutions to monitor the space situation and detect threats.
The main challenge is therefore to harmonize a shared military space picture: what its content must be, how to build it, how to share it among Member States according to an agreed information policy, considering that the participating Member States may start from different heritages and may have different interests in space.
The long-term objective of such an extended capability is to achieve a European independence on military SSA, to safeguard European interests in space and rebalance the strategic dialogue on the military SSA topic.
Scope:
The proposals, supplementing the civilian objectives of EU SST, must address the development of an advanced space C2 solution to process and exploit SSA data generated from sensors and catalogues in order to provide a complete space picture.
Such solution must take into consideration the following aspects:
in-orbit assets to monitor and to protect;
perception of the threats, accidental and intentional, in LEO (Low Earth orbit), MEO (Medium Earth orbit), GEO (Geostationary Earth orbit);
access to a catalogue and to identification data, from patrimonial / partners / trustable-commercial sensors, with different levels of quality and availability;
SSA centres / C2s, or at least different analysis tools;
perimeter of responsibilities of ministries of defence and national civil agencies;
level of participation in the EU SST (Space surveillance and tracking) consortium, which currently provides the main European capability for detection and tracking.
One of the objective of the proposal must be to agree on and implement the content of a shared actionable recognised space picture.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study, design and prototyping of systems and subsystems, not excluding downstream activities.
The targeted activities must in particular include:
feasibility studies and system architectural definition of a European SC2 capability. This phase must cover military user requirements analysis, architecture definition, establishment of a programmatic roadmap, preliminary specification of the SSA architecture components (C2, communications, networking);
formalisation of joint requirements, CONOPS drivers, use cases and architectural drivers, by involving the ministries of defence of the participating Member States to ensure design / operational consistency with other actions, if any, relating to SSA sensors in this call;
identification and characterization of the relevant sources of data that can contribute to feed the system:
patrimonial sources from participating Members States;
sources from their institutional partners;
sources from trustable / qualified commercial providers.
definition of CONOPS of the shared part of the SC2, especially:
which (and how) catalogue, identification and other types of data should be accessed or shared, between which ministries of defence or other national entity (content, level of processing, mode of access, security;
how could these data be further processed and fused, in order to improve their coverage, accuracy, reactiveness;
which sensors (or network of sensors) could be accessed and shared, by who, and how;
which military services and analysis tools can be shared, e.g. to characterize objects, detect abnormal behaviour, evaluate intentional threats, support military operations (ground, air, sea, space);

performance engineering regarding cataloguing and identification of space objects on all orbits: completeness, accuracy, reactiveness;
definition of the overall data model, pertaining to:
technical data: orbital and tracking data, identification data (optical and radar imagery, optical and RF spectral data), their auxiliary data, in order to ensure a consistent ingestion, storage, exploitation, share of data within either national C2 or a shared multinational area;
operational and supervision data, allowing the national C2s to reflect the operational status of shared sensors;
This activity must associate the provider of each selected data.
development of a military SC2 prototype to evaluate architecture performances, help to support concepts of operation with users and support specifications. It must serve to demonstrate how:
requests (measurement or access to database) from different national authorities are taken into account and validated;
ground sensor planning and tasking is performed;
segregation and confidentiality of requests and results are preserved, according to the policy that must be defined, and how the common operational space picture is achieved.
specification, prototyping and experimentation of structural or critical components, including security management (connectors, etc.);
coordination with other actions, if any, relating to SSA sensors in the same call.
Main high-level requirements
The proposed solution should fulfil the following requirements.
The networking of C2, and the (potential) multinational / sharing area, together with the set of shared national, partners and commercial data and exploitation services should meet the following requirements:
an all-orbit coverage;
a detection / tracking / characterization sensitivity compatible with intentionally threatening objects and events;

The security rules of participating Member States should be met, to protect national and shared data and operations;
It should make appropriate use of national existing / in-development / planned SSA C2’s or equivalent assets.
The European military SSN should allow the national military space operations centres to improve detection and tracking capability of events such as appearance of new objects, close approach of a high value asset by a foreign object.
The SSN should also allow gathering intelligence on unknown objects through their dynamic behaviour, their optical signature and its variation, and their radio emissions in order to support the evaluation of their mission.
In this scenario, new applications should be available to complement traditional SST services such as collision avoidance, conjunction analysis, re-entry and fragmentation:
pattern of life;
anomaly detection;
spawning;
warning.
The SC2 should fulfil the following requirements:
the SC2 system should provide the capability to detect, track and characterise space objects of military interest as expressed by participating Member States;
the SC2 system should be modular and allow each participating Member State to configure / adapt the SC2 at national level to meet its own requirements;
the SC2 system should meet the military performance standard in terms of security, RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety), response time, resilience, surveillance capacity;
the SC2 system should allow processing of data from heterogeneous sources (own SSA sensors, partner sensors (military/civil) as well as commercial sensors, contributor sensors (e.g. early warning sensors) or other external data sources);
the SC2 system should have an incremental approach for deployment – e.g. near-term architecture using existing assets, mid-term architecture using additional new sensors and final architecture should be defined, avoiding any duplication with on-going initiatives at national and Union level (especially EU-SST);
the space surveillance interoperable architecture should be scalable by design, easy to extend, able to accommodate an increasing number of users and an increasing capacity;
the technical implementation of the data processing and data exchange should foresee the possibility to define data policy rules and should ensure the required level of data security (data integrity, authentication and encryption, etc.);
SSA data and requests should be exchanged in standardised formats, prioritizing already agreed international standards (if available, such as ECSS or CCSDS (Consultative committee for space data systems.); TDMs (Tracking data messages) and OEMs (Orbit ephemeris messages) etc.) for sharing space tracking data and orbital position data or should be agreed amongst partners;
SSA information should be exchanged in a cyber-secured and controlled way, ensuring data integrity, authentication and encryption, in respect of the relevant applicable security standards, and allowing exchanges amongst agreed levels of security classification;
the SC2 system should provide user interfaces suitable for use by trained personnel within their area of expertise, adaptable and upgradeable;
a common glossary/documentation of exchanged data, accuracy, underlying models and algorithms should be produced to ensure interoperability. Test procedures should be defined to allow confirmation.
Nota: Member States will maintain full control on their own military SSA capabilities and data, including data dissemination.
Expected Impact:
Contribute to the design of an agreed operational and technical SSA capability, shared within associated Member States, with no unnecessary duplication, and providing synergies of data, sensors, services for a mutual benefit;
Ensure secure and efficient solution of high performance system for specific military end-users, to complement and optimize the use of civilian SST systems;

Space assets and systems have become critical to ensure vital functions of military operations and need to be protected in their outer space environment. Theatre of an unprecedented strategic and military competition, space is likely to become a new confrontation frontline in the near future. Easier access to space, increased space debris in orbit and the existence of space objects capable of offensive actions, imply the necessity for European countries to upgrade or acquire capabilities to protect their space assets and strengthen the potential of their sovereign resources.
Acknowledging these changes to the security environment, and to face them better, the EU Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy (EUGS) has started a process of closer cooperation in security and defence. Through this process, based on the identified trends and information gathered from Member States and from the EU Military Committee, security has become today an integral part of the European Space Policy: in 2018, Space Surveillance has been highlighted as a capability gap in the progress catalogue of the EU Military Staff (EUMS) and Space Situational Awareness has been identified as a priority in the EU Capability Development Plan (CDP).
Above the SST sensors provided through the EU-SST initiative, EU military needs cutting edge technology sensors to better identify and characterize the threats (what is it? what is it capable of?) in order to reliably attribute threats.
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of future enhanced SSA sensors to improve identification and characterization of existing and future GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit), MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) and LEO (Low Earth Orbit) public and private assets.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Diving capabilities are a strategic asset, where critical gaps are currently identified within the EU. Enhanced defence diving is needed to support the full spectrum of underwater intervention operations in expeditionary setting, both at sea and in inland bodies of water. The developed diving related capabilities should respond to 2018 CDP priorities with regard to manoeuvre at sea, protection of sea lines of communications and underwater regulated zones, enhancement of the resilience of EU critical maritime infrastructure and the conduct of mine counter measures (MCM).
Specific challenges
Diving activities in general involve a risk which is a sum of many diving specific and nonspecific factors (risk components), some of which are not fully studied yet and are to be addressed by tailor-made and innovative solutions based on cutting-edge and disruptive technologies.
Ability to avoid/mitigate Decompression Sickness (DCS) risk. Although scientists have focused on studying the decompression process for a long time, the basic principles are not fully understood yet. The current decompression models are mostly empirical and hypothetical and do not fully reflect the actual behaviour and reactions of the human body during decompression. DCS risk is influenced by individual human susceptibility and by intra-individual changes in susceptibility on a day-by-day basis. There is also a gap for innovative technologies for reliable and effective medical support and recovery of divers, such as technologies tailored to individual real-time diving profiles, which increases the efficiency of DCS avoidance/mitigation and provides flexibility and efficiency in case of decompression accident.
Ability to create and use a real-time underwater common operational picture through the fusion of various types of information, as a collaborative planning and task-execution tool at all levels, thus enhancing operational effectiveness through a unified information exchange system.
Necessity to ensure interoperability, coordination and de-confliction of underwater intervention activities, including manned-unmanned teaming, involving employment of a big number of divers and UUVs simultaneously (swarm). The methods and systems in use are often obsolete, imprecise or not reliable enough for defence application.

the elaboration of roadmap(s) for further developments.
Main high-level requirements
The proposed solutions should fulfil the following requirements:
the system should support lower tactical level operations in underwater environment and should comply with applicable military and/or civil standards. It should in particular be consistent with relevant NATO standards;
the tactical comprehensive modular information and support system should demonstrate low electromagnetic footprint and should be modular, providing scalability according to the operational needs;
the system should support suitable interoperability standards for exchange of C2 (Command and control) data and ISR (Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) products to be ready for integration into an overall information management infrastructure in order to enable net-centric operations;
the system should incorporate a navigation subsystem capable of operation in a GNSS degraded or denied environment;
the system should support extended autonomy mode operations without external power source;
the system should have swarming capabilities in underwater manned-unmanned settings;
the system should be easily deployable and recoverable;
cybersecurity by design principles should be followed to develop a system resilient to cyber-attacks, which could lead to data flow disruption and information leakages;
adoption of open architecture design principles with regards to the subsystems so as to facilitate the incorporation of new components and platforms and advances in standards and protocols, especially those related to interoperability.
The proposed solutions should include:
a component for real time monitoring, registering and data transmission of relevant physiological parameters of diver(s) underwater;
a component for real time automatic calculation of individualized diving decompression profile, taking into account the following variables as a minimum: individual body characteristics; current physiological parameters of the diver; the diving equipment being used and the chosen breathing gas. The calculated/optimized decompression profile should be visualized in real time, both for the diver underwater and for the diving supervisor on the surface;
a component for divers’ support and recovery based on the real time profiles of the divers;
a component providing a solution to operate in case of decompression sickness problem, employing transportable and easy deployable hyperbaric unit;
a component for tracking and visualization (on the surface) of the real time location of diver(s) working underwater;
a component for data transmission and information flow between surface and underwater and in underwater environment;
Man to Machine Interface (MMI) between manned and unmanned systems ensuring interoperability, coordination and de-confliction of underwater activities, including manned-unmanned teaming in swarm mode setting, when multiple divers and UUVs (AUVs (Autonomous underwater vehicles), ROVs (Remotely operated vehicles.), etc.) are being employed simultaneously.
The proposed solutions can be based on a modular concept of comprehensive systems, providing information, monitoring, communications, positioning, support management and situational awareness and manned-unmanned systems teaming.
Expected Impact:
At strategic level:
to identify and confirm the key technological breakthroughs enabling to tackle future challenges in defence diving domain;
to enable globally an enhanced performance of underwater activities related to defence diving;
to support the development of a competitive and efficient ecosystem able to position a true, consolidated European offer in defence diving domain.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Prefabricated components are more and more commonly used in the construction sector. Compared to traditional construction processes, prefabrication aims at reducing costs without compromising quality and facilitating installation/dismantling/re-use of components. It also facilitates the re-use of residue materials from the civil and industrial sectors. Building components could, when relevant, be prefabricated in factories to gain on construction time and to improve on-site health and safety. Accelerating the time for installation is particularly suitable for renovation while being occupied. Prefabrication should be adaptable to individual renovation solutions as well as for mass manufacturing in adequate projects and be adjusted and linked to computer design tools. 
Further research is needed to improve understanding of material and component behaviour in the whole life cycle[1] and, consequently, to be able to produce better performing products, taking into account important aspects such as the overall thermal performance and airtightness. Innovative technologies for energy efficiency (e.g. HVAC components) and renewable energy sources (e.g. photovoltaics, solar collector) can also be integrated in the prefabricated multi-functional modules and components. The elements are to be developed, prototyped, optimised and transferred from individual manufacturing to mass production.
Scope: Innovative mass manufacturing processes must be investigated to lower pre-fabrication costs and ease building integration processes, also taking into account the challenge of aesthetics of existing buildings. This requires the development of new controlled processes and cost-effective automated/robotised tools.
These innovations should be combined with integrated processes and the use of advanced computer based tools like Building Information Modelling which will facilitate the industrialisation of the whole construction process and integrate the value chain over the life cycle of the project. Durability of proposed solutions will have to be evaluated in real installation conditions, incorporating integrated and embedded reliable monitoring systems, as this is a crucial factor that influences final product performances. The criteria and methods for evaluation of the benefits should be transparent and simple.
During the development of technology and components for prefabricated facade elements, the use of recycled materials should be investigated and structural engineering aspects must be taken into account to enhance the automated and robotized construction technologies. A business model addressing cost-optimality aspects for given building types and geo-clusters across Europe should be addressed in the proposals.
The proposals should cover mainly demonstration activities. Prototypes and pilot implementations in real industrial settings represent a clear added-value, as does the involvement of SMEs involved in the manufacture and installation of prefabricated modules.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic will be implemented under the PPP on Energy-efficient Buildings. The activities are expected to be implemented at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Expected impact:
         Reduction in total buildings (primary) energy consumption by at least a factor of 2 with respect to the current situation, and a cost-level better than traditional renovation activities.
         Significant reduction of renovation operations while ensuring low intrusiveness and impact for users.
         Reduction in installation time by at least 30%, compared to a typical renovation process for the building type.
         Better quality standard and performance guarantee for the installed prefabricated modules and their integrated components, while enhancing indoor air quality.
         Demonstration of the replicability potential.
         A maximum return on investment below 10 years for end-users.
         Generation of new high-tech SMEs specialised in renovation with prefabricated modules.
         High-skill jobs for workers that could master innovative construction tools.

cybersecurity aspects must be taken into account along all project phases, from requirements capture to system design and implementation, in order to ensure adequate resilience, survivability and information protection;
the architecture must be adapted to the doctrine generated in Europe.
The architecture of the distributed simulation system must take into consideration all necessary future elements, and in particular:
simulation and communication equipment and infrastructure, in order to be able to exchange information between the Member States' simulation centres and information systems. This may require the use of dedicated terrestrial networks and satellite links, hub infrastructure and terminals;
the infrastructure to setup dedicated simulation centres, including facilities for operators, data centres, and all the associated equipment (such as operators' equipment, voice / video communications, local communications, etc.);
deployable simulation centres, providing operators with workstations, a deployable data centre, communication means and the required infrastructure;
architecture designed for security accreditation and cyber defence in order to prevent cyber-attacks and to protect the information.
Expected Impact:
Develop critical enablers for CSDP operations and EU Battlegroup missions;
Reduce the minimum reaction time for deployment of European military missions;
Integrate simulation means provided by Member States, EU forces, NATO and civil agencies;
Improve situational awareness, resilience and security of EU operations;
Create a reference simulation architecture that will improve the capabilities of the European defence industry to develop and supply state-of-the-art simulation systems;
Reinforce interoperability of EU Member States’ armed forces;
Reduce the cost of European military missions;
Reduce training and travelling costs thanks to distributed simulation."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Due to their spending power and pivotal role within the community, the public sector is an important driver in supporting a market transformation towards more efficient energy systems, buildings, products, services and towards stimulating a general public behaviour for increased uptake of energy efficiency solutions.
One of the key challenges remains in linking up public bodies at the national, regional and local level through effective multi-level governance to realise an energy transition driven from the local level with concerted planning and implementation of energy projects, as well as in achieving a coherent transformation of the energy system capitalising on synergies and economies of scale.
Scope:
a) Actions aiming at engaging public authorities – open in 2016/2017
Proposals demonstrating an innovative approach in empowering public authorities to step up their active role to develop, finance and implement ambitious sustainable energy plans and measures (for instance by capitalising on synergies with the Covenant of Mayors or Smart Cities & Communities or similar public initiatives), on the basis of reliable data. Public actors are encouraged to adopt a multi-stakeholder approach and to look at sectors with high energy saving potential such as buildings, industry and urban mobility, as well as to take into consideration the integration of relevant indoor environment quality[1] criteria regulations when increasing energy efficiency performance of buildings.
Proposals should focus on one of the following topics:
Raising the capacity of Member States to fulfil their obligation under the Energy Efficiency Directive, Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, Ecodesign and Labelling Directives (e.g. monitoring on the energy efficiency progress and policies)
Innovative ways to enable public engagement in the energy transition, developing interface capacities within public authorities to engage with civil society
Supporting public authorities to foster integrated energy, transport mobility and land-use planning at local level
Supporting public authorities to foster multi-level governance, linking up local, regional and national levels for delivering integrated sustainable energy planning and projects to achieve synergies and economies of scale
Enhance and create appropriate structures for rolling-out quality management and certification schemes for energy efficiency/renewable energy targeted in municipalities, as well as supporting collaboration between scheme operators to attract a higher number of municipalities.
Developing financing strategies for capital-intensive technologies for heating and cooling (e.g. heat pumps).
b) Peer to peer learning for public authorities - step up public authorities' capacity to help deliver the energy transition – open in 2016/2017
Support will be provided to facilitating organisations which are identifying the peer-learning potential and facilitating in-depth exchange across Europe. Facilitating organisation consortia will involve the Local and Regional Energy Agencies and other relevant actors and will be in charge of i) developing and implementing a transparent and effective identification and matching process, based on evident needs and mutual benefits of potential participant as well as on successful sustainable energy projects and measures; ii) assessing the replication potential and delivering a replication plan (peer-learning plan) including documenting the results and impacts in an easily accessible format for wider application; iii) organising the peer-learning exchanges; iv) defining the learning objectives and expected impacts and; v) proactively disseminating and ensuring further replication of results (e.g. replication strategy) beyond the participating public authorities and Member States.
Proposals should provide indicative cost data structure for the set-up, facilitation and running of the exchange programmes including the specific cost per exchange.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below:
Primary energy savings, renewable energy production and investments in sustainable energy triggered in the territory of participating parties by the project within its duration (respectively in GWh/year and million Euro of investments per million Euro of EU funding); (for a & b)

","15 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Too much of Europe's building stock is inefficient in terms of energy use, with excessive heat losses through building envelopes and technical building systems. In addition, buildings need to contribute a greater share of renewable energy production. Too few buildings are undergoing deep renovation (whereby energy savings exceed 60% compared to pre-renovation levels) and such renovations are often too expensive. There is a need to demonstrate more cost-effective and practical ways of achieving deep renovation while reducing the time needed to renovate a building and at the same time promoting a holistic optimized approach that goes beyond the results of European and national projects, and the IEA report on Prefabricated Systems for Low Energy Renovation of Residential Buildings.
Scope:
Proposals should demonstrate and promote innovative processes leading in practice to more cost-effective, higher quality, holistic and faster deep renovation of buildings with less disturbance of the residents. Proposals should demonstrate the contribution to an increased rate of renovation in a specific district/city/region. The building renovations may use pre-fabricated mass manufactured components or ""plug and play"" energy and ventilation systems, including innovations needed during the on-site phase. Proposals should consider innovative integrated packages of commercially available technologies. This typically includes actions on the building envelope and on the technical building systems both including renewable energy sources and conversion and storage technologies, in order to achieve very high energy performance. The proposals could include specific solutions for historic buildings, when applicable. Means of sharing technical information on the building over its whole life cycle could also be considered[1]. Proposals should ensure that the solutions guarantee high indoor environmental quality (thermal and visual comfort, acoustics, air quality, etc.). If necessary proposals should include smart controls to allow integration with the energy grid. Embodied energy and the possibility of reusing and recycling materials at the end of a building's life are highly relevant to the building's overall life cycle, therefore these aspects should also be taken into account.
Solutions should demonstrate the integration potential of innovative processes and explore how they could facilitate renovation. Proposals could make use of geo-clusters[2] to respond to specific needs and to demonstrate the potential for replication.
Synergies may be considered with activities initiated under the topic LCE-17-2017.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic will be implemented under the PPP on Energy-efficient Buildings. The activities are expected to be implemented at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6-8 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Proposers should note that this topic is also complemented by other topics relating to deep renovation, including in the PPP on Energy Efficient Buildings.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Net primary energy use reduced by 60% compared to pre-renovation levels;
Cost reduction of at least 15% compared with a typical renovation (i.e. a renovation that meets current minimum requirements of existing building regulations[3]);
Demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed solutions to reach an increased rate of renovation of a defined building typology in a specific district/city/region.
Reduction in time needed for renovation by a factor of 2 at least compared to typical present day renovation.

As underlined in the Investment Plan for Europe, there is continued need for building a solid and transparent pipeline of sustainable energy investment projects to help the EU unlock additional investments and in order to demonstrate their financial viability and attractiveness, in particular, to private investors. Whilst there is already a significant pipeline of large scale renewable energy projects, investors and lenders need to gain more confidence on investment projects related to energy efficiency which are still seen as risky and fragmented. EU added value can be obtained in particular where projects introduce innovation to the market regarding project aggregation and financing solutions minimising transaction costs and engaging the private finance community as well as where projects demonstrably remove legal, administrative and other market barriers for mainstreaming large scale sustainable energy investment schemes.
Scope:
Project Development Assistance (PDA) will be provided to public and private project promoters such as public authorities or their groupings, public/private infrastructure operators and bodies, energy service companies, retail chains, estate managers and services/industry. The aim of the action is thus to build technical, economic and legal expertise needed for project development and leading to the launch of concrete investments.
The proposed investments will be launched before the end of the action which means that projects should result in signed contracts (or launched tendering procedures as appropriate) for sustainable energy investments to that effect, e.g. construction works, energy performance contracts, turnkey contracts.
The PDA focusses on the sectors of existing public and private buildings; street lighting; retrofitting of existing district heating/ cooling; energy efficiency in urban transport (such as transport fleets, the logistics chain, e-mobility, modal change and shift) in urban/sub-urban agglomerations and other densely populated areas and energy efficiency in industry and services.
Whilst proposals may address investments into distributed, small-scale renewable energy sources in combination with energy efficiency, the main focus should lie on capturing untapped high energy efficiency potentials.
Proposals should have an exemplary/showcase dimension in their ambition to reduce energy consumption and/or in the size of the expected investments. Proposals should also deliver organisational innovation in the financial engineering (e.g. on-bill financing schemes, guarantee funds, or factoring funds) and/or in the mobilisation of the investment programme (e.g. bundling, pooling or stakeholder engagement). Innovation should be demonstrated taking into account the state-of-the-art. In addition, proposals should demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results towards potential replicators across the EU.
This PDA facility focuses on small and medium-sized energy investments of at least EUR 7.5 million to EUR 50 million[1].

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There is a need to set up innovative financing schemes at regional or national level in order to create the conditions for adequate supply of private finance for energy efficiency investments. New financing schemes can therefore play an important role in supporting the effective implementation of the Investment Plan for Europe and the effective use of European Structural and Investments Funds (ESIF). This requires among others setting up the legal and technical arrangements between the key actors on a given territory, agreeing on common procedures for qualifying projects and financing them, setting up templates for technical specifications and contracts, etc. However, the development of new financing schemes should always be based on the principles of complementarity and additionality, as well as transparency and due diligence and reflect the fundamentals of the given territory or market segment.
Innovative financing schemes can involve different types of organisations and ownership structures and include for example replication of previously demonstrated successful financing models such as dedicated credit lines; guarantee facilities; factoring/forfaiting schemes; on-bill (e.g. utility-financed) or on-tax financing schemes; citizen financing (e.g. crowd-funding) for energy efficiency; finance models for the deep renovation of buildings, addressing both property and rental markets; or schemes based on project aggregators or clearing houses at regional or national level, which should support project development and match demand and supply of energy efficiency finance.
The large-scale roll-out of innovative financing schemes may also require overcoming a number of obstacles such as the lack of competences, in particular for public authorities, as well as the legal and policy framework at national and EU levels in order to support the implementation of effective and sustainable energy systems and value chains.
Scope:
Proposals should address the development or replication of innovative financing schemes including various forms of on-bill financing (e.g. utility-financed). Exploring possible avenues of supporting energy efficiency financing by innovating the framework and instruments that could be further up-scaled (e.g. under the European cohesion policy or other schemes). Analyse impacts of existing financial instruments and requirements for up-scaling. Proposals should include capacity building on innovative financing for specific groups of stakeholders such as Member States, public authorities, energy agencies, energy consultants, and the financial sector, led by or involving professional federations or associations at the national level as appropriate. Capacity building could use concrete examples developed through project development facilities (e.g. ELENA, MLEI PDA). Training tools should be complementary to already existing/recognised training schemes for the targeted groups, and demonstrate sustainability.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Sub-optimal levels of investment in sustainable energy (in particular energy efficiency) are linked, among others, to a lack of trust of investors and financiers in the financial viability of energy efficiency measures. Banks, institutional investors and asset managers lack the skills and operational tools to effectively assess sustainable energy investments and integrate energy efficiency in their investment strategies. Access to the capital markets for energy efficiency investments is hampered by the lack of standardisation of assets.
Scope:
Proposals should address one or more of the following issues:
Development, demonstration and promotion of frameworks for the standardisation and benchmarking of energy efficiency investments such as labelling schemes, project rating methodologies and risk assessment tools, standardised legal and financial structures of assets (loans, guarantees, energy performance contracts etc.) in order to develop securitisation and rating models for energy efficiency based financial products, which should enable the development of and access to secondary markets. Proposals integrated in a broader approach such as socially responsible investment should focus on the energy component.
Gathering, processing and disclosing large-scale data on actual financial performance of energy efficiency investments, in order to create a track record for energy efficiency in different sectors (buildings, industry, transport, etc.). Further integrating the 'green value' of buildings in property valuation through collection of market data across the EU and actions targeted to the key actors in the sale or lease process (e.g. real estate agents, property valuers, notaries, etc.)
Targeting institutional investors (e.g. public pension schemes) in order to increase the share of their funds invested in energy efficiency, or to develop specific funds or investment products. Supporting the integration of energy efficiency in portfolio management strategies for institutional investors and/or fund managers, including through re-definition of fiduciary duties.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Sub-optimal levels of investment in sustainable energy (in particular energy efficiency) are linked, among others, to a lack of trust of investors and financiers in the financial viability of energy efficiency measures. Banks, institutional investors and asset managers lack the skills and operational tools to effectively assess sustainable energy investments and integrate energy efficiency in their investment strategies. Access to the capital markets for energy efficiency investments is hampered by the lack of standardisation of assets.
Scope:
Proposals should address one or more of the following issues:
Development, demonstration and promotion of frameworks for the standardisation and benchmarking of energy efficiency investments such as labelling schemes, project rating methodologies and risk assessment tools, standardised legal and financial structures of assets (loans, guarantees, energy performance contracts etc.) in order to develop securitisation and rating models for energy efficiency based financial products, which should enable the development of and access to secondary markets. Proposals integrated in a broader approach such as socially responsible investment should focus on the energy component.
Gathering, processing and disclosing large-scale data on actual financial performance of energy efficiency investments, in order to create a track record for energy efficiency in different sectors (buildings, industry, transport, etc.). Further integrating the 'green value' of buildings in property valuation through collection of market data across the EU and actions targeted to the key actors in the sale or lease process (e.g. real estate agents, property valuers, notaries, etc.)
Targeting institutional investors (e.g. public pension schemes) in order to increase the share of their funds invested in energy efficiency, or to develop specific funds or investment products. Supporting the integration of energy efficiency in portfolio management strategies for institutional investors and/or fund managers, including through re-definition of fiduciary duties.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below (wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets), depending on the activities of the proposal:
Reduced uncertainty as regards investments into energy efficiency and increased investors' confidence;
Frameworks, standardisation, benchmarking, standardised descriptions and data evidence of financial returns of energy efficiency investments agreed and accepted by the market;
Higher allocation of institutional investments to energy efficiency; standardisation of assets enabling securitisation; development of a secondary market for energy efficiency assets."

As underlined in the Investment plan for Europe, significant investments are needed in the scale of around EUR 100 billion per year[1] in order to meet the 2020 and 2030 energy efficiency targets of the European Union. While the EU Structural and Investment Funds and national support schemes can contribute to some extent with public finance, most of the financing needs to come from the private sector. The Energy Efficiency Market Report by the International Energy Agency[2] confirms that energy efficiency is becoming an established financial market segment, energy efficiency finance is expanding and innovating, with new funding approaches and business models, and the market potential for energy efficiency is growing significantly. However, in order to reach more quickly the full market potential, the development and large-scale uptake of new business models and energy efficiency services such as Energy Performance Contracting combined with innovative financing solutions are needed to better monetise the future energy savings for the initial investments.
Scope:
Proposals aiming at developing, demonstrating and standardising new types of energy efficiency services and business models in all sectors (incl. mobility), which could better monetise the multiple benefits of energy efficiency[3].
Supporting the further development of energy performance contracting or similar methods based on monetisation of energy savings and other benefits by new types of actors (e.g. industry, facility managers, construction companies, social housing operators, or other actors) and/or in new market segments (e.g. residential sector).
Support the development of innovative energy efficiency services and business models for industrial and service companies enhancing the implementation of energy audit recommendations. Special focus should be placed on the implementation of energy efficiency measures in industries and companies that use large shares of thermal demand (e.g. hotels, leisure centres, retail, hospitals) in order to accelerate the uptake of energy efficient and renewable heating and cooling solutions.

The role of insulation is essential to achieve energy efficiency in renovated buildings and in nearly zero energy buildings following the requirements of the recast of the Energy Performance of Building Directive (2010/31/EU). An improved insulation in buildings will have a large impact on the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions at European level. It can also bring significant environmental, economic and social benefits both for the Member States and for the citizens.
Although currently many materials are available on the market, there is a strong need to develop affordable advanced insulation materials which exceed the performance of presently used materials, and also respect strict sustainability principles.
Scope:
Proposals should address the development and characterisation of new insulation materials and solutions based on nanotechnologies and/or advanced sustainable materials and offering enhanced insulation properties and environmental performance. Proposals could also consider highly effective insulation materials that respond dynamically to environmental stimuli (temperature, light, humidity, air and biological pollution, etc..)
The proposed solutions should go well beyond the state of the art and take into account the final performance properties of the new materials and of the respective building components.
The following factors should also be considered: enhanced durability for increased use duration, reduced maintenance and reduced costs; respect of sustainability principles (the sustainability of each developed solution should be evaluated via life cycle assessment studies carried out according to the International Reference Life Cycle Data System - ILCD Handbook); reduced embodied energy and minimised environmental impacts; applicability to both new build and renovation; lightweight construction and ease of installation; realistic solutions at a competitive price; limited impact on living space; improvement of indoor air quality; increased comfort and noise reduction; fully compatible with a wide set of material combinations which reflect the wide variety of building typologies across the EU; fit for deconstruction; reuse/recycling of materials at end of life. Resistance to damaging agents such as fire, moisture, rodents etc. should also be considered when relevant for the application. Standardisation aspects should be included particularly in relation with the work carried out in CEN/TC 350. Additional properties such as multi-functionality, load bearing capacity (and other mechanical properties), and use of wastes may also be considered.
Proof of concept in terms of one (or more) component(s) containing the new materials developed should be delivered within the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes (2006/C323/01), but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs duly justifying availability of the proposed materials for potential further massive use and wide replication across Europe. Information guides for applications, installation and training on the new solutions should be provided before the end of the project.
In addition to the industrial, academic and construction stakeholders, the participation of public authorities would also be an asset for the proposals, as public authorities own a large part of the building stock at European level.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Compared to state of the art materials and components, the newly developed materials should bring:
Improvement by at least 25% of the insulation properties at component level;
Reduction by at least 20% of the total costs compared to existing solutions;
Improvement by at least 20 % of durability at component level;
Respect of sustainability principles;
Improvement in indoor air quality;
Proof of high replication potential both in new built and renovation in Europe;
Easier implementation;
At least a 15% reduction of the energy spent during the whole life cycle of a building;
Contribution to standardisation and certification activities.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

The construction sector is a key player in the efforts to decarbonise the European economy with the goal to drastically reduce energy consumption and decrease CO2 emissions. Key Performance Indicators, along with appropriate methodologies and tools are crucial in order to quantify and benchmark the energy-efficiency and the environmental quality at building and district level. Adequate monitoring and management techniques are also needed, mixing results and practices from the building sector together with other relevant sectors like energy grid to ensure an effective performance improvement both at building and district level.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on solutions beyond the state of the art, which will improve and provide a feedback on the experiences on energy efficiency and environmental quality from the latest generation of new and renovated buildings and their interactions in districts.

To establish a consolidated structured and geo-clustered analysis and compilation of the latest generation buildings and their interaction with district resources in order to develop the return of experience associated with them,
To identify and analyse relevant sectorial indicators, development of models providing insight in data and that will enable and support decision making for energy efficiency and environmental quality, from design to operational phases,
To elaborate and develop operational and harmonised protocols supporting tools and systems to characterize the performances in real operational conditions,
To develop benchmarks on the impact of the non-qualities on the overall energy performance, which protect privacy while allowing deep analysis,
To understand the specific causes of non-performance or sub-optimal performance throughout the entire life cycle (from design to construction and operation) and promoting best practices to the industry.

The energy consumed in the use phase for space heating, cooling and hot water generation represents most of the overall energy consumption in buildings (70-90% of total energy). In order to reduce this consumption, state-of-the-art or new technologies need to be deployed, developed and integrated with high efficiency equipment, both for residential buildings and districts. The share of renewable energies in the energy supply for heating, cooling and hot water generation needs to be increased.
Cost effective, practical and affordable solutions need to be demonstrated and validated to ensure the success of the retrofitting business. The current potential of energy saving in the EU through renovation activities is very high. In Europe there are two main categories and segments to cover: residential buildings and district networks connecting.
Regarding the existing residential buildings which represent the largest part of the energy consumption, there is an urgent need to develop integrated solutions that would fit with the current natural gas boilers dominance in the EU market.
For the district networks connecting buildings, systems should be improved with the support of high efficient control systems that manage better the demand/supply for heating and cooling, and that could fit with a better exploitation of the waste heat available from various industrial or commercial sources.
Scope:
Buildings retrofitting potential in the EU is huge and existing heating/cooling technologies do not sufficiently enable the integration of new advanced efficient systems. Proposals should embrace two types of buildings: residential buildings and district heating/ cooling connected buildings. For both types, the integration of new reliable systems should be based on new or existing reliable design tools which would facilitate taking the decision on the installation of the best solutions. The research activities should at least address the following areas:
Integration of advanced heating and cooling technologies such as hybrid systems combining fossil based equipment with renewables systems (cost competitive heat pump kits, solar thermal or biomass systems are attractive combinations).
Energy waste heat/cool sources that may be exploited in the system.
Easy installation and integration of such equipment with concern to minimise the maintenance needed and to simplify the logistic.
Control and monitoring of the entire system, to ensure an efficient match between the supply and demand of energy, including ICT and algorithms embedded in the equipment.
Concerning the district systems, advanced District Heat and Cooling (DHC) systems, i.e. systems operating at low temperatures, must be able to deal with both centralised and de-centralised hybrid sources (e.g. solar thermal, biomass, geothermal, heat pumps, waste heat, excess renewable electricity storage).
Proposals should provide detailed information on the energy data of the buildings (current energy use and proposed reduction with new equipment, the gross floor area of the building together with the targeted annual energy use per m2, broken down by space heating, cooling, domestic hot water production, and lighting). The energy use should achieve at least the national limit values for new buildings according to the applicable legislation based on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6.
A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrate a high potential of replication across Europe contributing to large scale market deployment before 2025 with in particular the support of dedicated tool kits, which would be easy to install and would require a limited workforce.
Cost-effective highly energy-efficient equipment with target reduction of energy consumption of 20 -30 % (including renewables).
Payback period of below 10 years.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
As a consequence of economic development, construction and demolition waste (CDW) has become a serious problem, creating serious environmental pollution in certain areas of the world. In the EU, CDW accounts for approximately 25% - 30% of all waste generated and consists of numerous materials, many of which can be recycled.
Advanced research actions and technical solutions are required for large-scale reuse and recycling of construction materials in building refurbishment, contributing to overall CO2 and energy reduction. At the same time pre-fabricated components are now commonly used in the construction sector not just to reduce costs but also to facilitate installation/dismantling and re-use of components.
The development of pre-fabricated elements containing a high share of recycled materials and of energy-efficient building concepts considering a high fraction of material replacement is needed. The main focus would be on the recovery/ recycling of materials that have the highest technical and economic interest and which are associated to refurbishment or demolition processes.
At the same time, the possibility to reuse different materials in energy-efficient buildings should be further investigated through a proper characterisation of their properties. Also the development of processes for easy disassembly needs to be considered as well as the need to address strict regulations and standards (eg. anti-seismic) in several European regions.
The EC Waste Directive mentions under Art 11- 2b that: ""by 2020, the preparing for re-use, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials, of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the list of waste shall be increased to a minimum of 70 % by weight.""
Scope:
Energy-efficient building concepts using new or adapted prefabricated components need to be developed, in order to implement construction processes allowing the reuse and recycling of different materials and structures while reducing energy use and minimising environmental impacts.
In the case of building retrofitting with traditional construction methods poor results are frequently obtained. Recent developments show that even with new constructions the use of recycled materials is still a challenge when prefabrication is concerned. There is a need to address material flows (on-site and off-site processes) and harmonize the way to acquire and use all the information related to the building and its stakeholders (procurers, builders, owners, users, operators, etc.) in order to radically modify the construction processes (e.g. lean construction and higher degree of industrial building prefabrication), and the off-site production of components (e.g. prefabricated components).
Proposals should cover the following areas:
Optimisation of recyclability properties of the materials and development of solutions to recycle and reuse construction materials and existing building structures in particular through the uptake by the manufacturing chain.
Innovative pre-fabricated elements solutions integrating the latest developments in recycling and reuse of CDW as well as in construction and installation processes which show clear evidence of technical and economic viability for structural and non-structural components with a life-cycle perspective.
The project should also address the demonstration of the recycling technologies in the construction or refurbishment of energy-efficient buildings representative of at least two different climatic zones across Europe, allowing for a high replication potential.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
CO2 savings (by min. 30 %), energy savings (by min 20%), and higher resource efficiency (minimum share of recycled materials in final product of at least 10-15 %) will ultimately contribute to a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy.
Creation of new value chains by expanding the size and attractiveness of CDW recycling and reuse for energy-efficient buildings construction and refurbishment, properly tackling non-technological barriers.
High replication potential of the solutions obtained, with the possibility to export EU technology worldwide.

The storage of thermal or electric energy needs optimised operational technical solutions in order to better manage and synchronise the overall supply and demand (at residential, district and urban level). Good management of the peak loads, especially stemming from an increase of renewable energy production, would reduce the overall energy consumption and the cost of operation of the installations.
Hybrid solutions are needed, inherently addressing the seamless conversion and integration of renewable electricity and heat, as to anticipate the future energy grid that will fully allow an exchange of different energy carriers. Such hybrid solutions form a next step in the electrification of the heat supply market.
To go beyond current state of the art on thermal storage (i.e. compact systems) for residential buildings, it is necessary to bring research activities in this field closer to pre-commercial stage, to demonstrate their technical and economic viability, and to optimise the operation of such hybrid solutions in view of combining them with the surplus of renewable electricity with low temperature heat and cooling demand.
In the EU, there are nowadays just a few examples of operationally integrated solutions for the optimal interaction in district networks, combining both electricity and heat/cooling energy supply and storage.
Efficient use of renewable energy in hybrid systems for the storage and generation of energy needs to be achieved.
Scope:
Proposals should develop advanced innovative high-density hybrid energy storage devices, targeting the efficient use and further increase of renewable energy in the built environment, and demonstrating its value in terms of flexibility in the energy systems. They should address both electrical and thermal applications and able to reach a rapid release.
Such hybrid approaches encompass different aspects, which may be addressed separately or coherently:
high efficiency conversion and storage of surplus renewable electricity into heat;
multifunctional use in both heating and cooling applications at different temperature grades;
different time scales, e.g. in seasonal storage of high temperature solar heat and peak-shaving in lower temperature heat–pump applications.
Research and innovation activities should address:
electricity applications, where the technologies covered may include batteries, flywheels and capacitors suitable for applications in the power range of several tens of KW to 1 MW as well as other technologies related to storage of large-scale power needed for district areas.
thermal applications, where these hybrid solutions should develop the high efficiency conversion and storage of surplus renewable electricity into heat. The hybrid system should take into account the optimal ²integration of various potential heat storage media. Therefore, preference will be given to systems that exploit chemisorption or physisorption technologies (solid/ liquid) and/or latent heat (PCM). The innovation part of the project should include the possibility that energy systems may be connected, and of merging energy from different sources, e.g. renewable electricity combined preferably with electric storage and heat, industrial waste heat, heat grids, ground systems.
Proposals are expected to cover the various aspects of the overall system, such as design, storage materials, interfaces with various components and auxiliaries (heat exchangers, reactor etc) and include monitoring and control of the overall technologies/ components (BEMS).
Proposals should preferably include demonstration pilots for both residential and district connected buildings in at least two different climatic regions. They also need to integrate strategies for optimal interaction with the energy grid, and assess the value of this integration in view of flexibility in the energy system.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.

Methodology, guidelines and effective operational tools are needed to ease the selection between renovation scenarios. The analysis should take into account life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, indoor environment quality, as well as user behaviour and acceptance. Research should lead to innovative concepts for a systemic approach to retrofitting which integrates the most promising cost-effective technologies and materials, in order to reduce heat losses through the building envelope and also the energy consumption by ventilation and other energy distribution systems, while increasing the share of renewable energy in buildings.
The new tools will help revalorisation of existing buildings in the long term, including the energy performance of the building as a factor of the total property value. This should be reflected in the definition of innovative business models where all relevant actors are involved, including public authorities and investors.
Proposals should aim at maximizing the capacity of replication of the developed concepts and methods for integrated sustainable renovation. Large-scale market uptake should be addressed, for example by targeting buildings with similar use conditions and/or comparable blocks of buildings or districts in need for renovation.
Proposals should show clear evidence of technical and financial viability of the solution through their application on real case demonstrations.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Reduction of at least 60% in energy consumption in order to reach the target of near zero energy compared to the values before renovation, while enhancing indoor environmental quality.
Decrease of installation time by at least 30% compared to typical renovation process for the building type.
Demonstration of a high replicability potential and of large market uptake capacity.
Affordability considering all costs involved, with a payback period below 15 years.
New generation of skilled workers and SME contractors in the construction sector capable of applying a systemic approach to renovation.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

","Innovation action
","20 September 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Integration of energy harvesting approaches is a major challenge, in particular the development and integration of different renewable energy sources at building and district scale.
The envelope should be considered as an active and/or adaptive skin that interacts with the external environment and strongly influences the building energy performance and indoor comfort. Indeed, in view of a large-scale deployment of nearly-zero energy solutions in existing buildings, besides reducing energy demand through highly insulating materials and reduction measures, the possibility to harvest energy in the building envelope is of great importance.
The district dimension should be taken into account, both because of a higher potential for integration and optimisation of renewable energy sources, and because of the potential of additional energy harvesting approaches.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at maximising the harvesting of renewable energy (for heating, cooling, electricity, domestic hot water, etc.) at building and district scale (e.g. exploiting large renewable energy source installations and heating and cooling networks). Research results should contribute to drastic energy saving and CO2 emission reduction while enabling massive replication in low zero energy buildings and energy self-sufficient districts. the focus is on a cost-effective and easy installation in a wide variety of buildings and surroundings.
Buildings are connected with various entities like suppliers and distribution system operators through different networks (internet, smart meter linked to the grid, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, etc.). Therefore, proposals should take into account an appropriate integration of monitoring and control systems for the developed solutions, combining, where relevant, additional functionalities such as safety and security.
Proposals should be flexible enough to cope with different designs and architectural concepts, with components being especially shaped and integrating different material combinations (such as glass, pre-casted elements, membranes).
The modular dimension is important to allow a cost-effective and easy installation in a wide variety of buildings and processing practices.
Proposals should enable a reduction of maintenance and operation costs, in particular when many sensors and actuators are cost-effectively distributed throughout the envelope.
Applicability in different geographical areas is important.
Clear evidence of technical and economic viability should be provided by validating and demonstrating the proposed adaptable envelope in real case retrofitting projects.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6.
A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requiring other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The cost related to new technologies should not exceed conventional standard building costs by more than 20%.
Demonstration of the replicability potential in a real case-study.
Solutions with a payback period of below 10 years.
The integrated harvesting systems will cover at least 30-40 % of the overall energy demand for new buildings and 20% for renovated buildings.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

","Coordination and support action
","20 September 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The most important benefit associated with the refurbishment of an existing building comes from improving the energy performance, which gives an essential contribution to reach the EU 2020 consumption goals, taking into account that buildings represent 40% of the energy use in the EU. A key challenge for its large-scale implementation is the necessity to manage a broader involvement of stakeholders representing different interests and different responsibilities influencing the potential solutions and actions. This regards not only the choice of technologies, but also the design and renovation methods, as well as a number of socio-economic issues.
Nowadays, decentralised energy generation technologies have been demonstrated in a number of building applications in Europe and beyond but large scale uptake and business deployment of these technologies is still in its early stage. Currently, the renovation level is about 1.2% of the building stock in Europe per year and it should increase, according to the European Performance Building Directive (EPBD), to 2 - 3 % per year until 2030. Innovative business models which allow consumers and the market to invest with confidence in long term operation, maintenance, reliability and service levels need to be developed.
Scope:
Activities should focus on the benchmark and the assessment of innovative business models, evaluating different refurbishment packages enabling the selection of the most attractive and efficient ones for different building types (residential/District Heating Cooling connected) and climatic conditions, taking the maximum advantage of user behaviour and geo-clustering.
Adequate assessment tools and the methodological challenges facing analyses addressing the issue of comprehensive analytical approaches in order to inform business decisions in this respect need to be discussed. Life cycle models as input to the decision making process in the feasibility phase of the renovation project also need to be considered.
Proposals need to assess different highly resource-efficient business models for refurbishing buildings including the assessment of the possibilities provided by public procurement of innovative solutions, appropriate combinations of public and private funding, or only private funding. These concepts need to be developed taking into account the building owners, the socio-economic impacts, and the current EU crisis.
Proposals should also develop effective methods for steering and governance especially paying attention to the local scale, including the variety of actions by cities and municipalities that can define obligations or encourage voluntary actions. In particular the business models developed should support the preparation of innovation-related public building procurements by local/regional/national authorities or at European level, taking into account the needs of the public sector with regard to high-performance buildings (new or retrofitted ones).
The business models should cover the complete cycle as from the design phase of the building: decentralised energy generation technologies, integration, installation, commissioning, operation, servicing and maintenance, etc. In this framework, activities should cover business model design and optimisation, market and customer segmentation approaches for decentralised energy generation, consumer behaviour and decision driver research for optimising business model structures, supply chain and concept delivery optimisation, new earning models and financing mechanisms. In addition, proposers should also seek solutions to increase participation of stakeholders, considering methods to engage end users living in the buildings/neighbourhood and methods to increase the interest and commitment of building owners and market partners.
Socio-economic impacts of refurbishment should be taken into account considering the possibly drastic effects of high renovation costs on house owners and tenants, and seeking possible solutions to reduce costs, as well as addressing the needed commitment by users to energy efficiency after renovation.
Clear evidence of technical, environmental and economic viability should be provided. The possibility to engage municipalities planning to integrate renewable energy sources in the built environment could be an added value.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 500000 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Cost-effectiveness of the renovation compared to current costs.
Adaptive renovation packages with high energy efficiency and low environmental impact.
Increased awareness of and commitment to improved energy-efficiency of the building stock.
Increased capacity of municipalities to effect the renovation of building stocks, in particular through the use of public procurement tools.
Better quality standards and performance guarantees while improving indoor environment and remaining cost-effective.
More involvement of customers/users in the integrated–innovative business model solutions.

JEAN MONNET NETWORKS (POLICY DEBATE WITH THE ACADEMIC WORLD)
WHAT IS A JEAN MONNET NETWORK?
Jean Monnet Networks foster the creation and development of consortia of international players (HEIs, Research Centres, Associations, etc.) in the area of European Union studies.
They contribute to gathering information, exchanging practices, building knowledge and promoting the European integration process across the world. This Action can also support the enhancement of existing networks supporting specific activities, notably fostering the participation of young researchers in EU-related themes.
These projects will be based on proposals, focused on activities that cannot be achieved successfully at a national level and require the involvement of a minimum of three partner organisations (including the applicant institution) from three different countries. Their aim is to undertake projects that have a multinational rather than a national dimension.
WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE SUPPORTED UNDER THIS ACTION?
Over the lifetime of a project, networks may typically realise a broad range of activities, such as for example:
gathering information and promoting results of methodologies applied by high-level research and teaching on EU topics;
enhancing cooperation between different higher education institutions and other relevant bodies throughout Europe and around the world;
exchanging knowledge and expertise with a view to mutually enhancing good practices;
fostering cooperation and creating a high knowledge exchange platform with public actors and the European Commission services on highly relevant EU subjects.
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF ORGANISATIONS PARTICIPATING IN A JEAN MONNET NETWORKS?
Jean Monnet Networks should become reference points in the European Union subject areas they cover. They will take the role of multipliers and disseminate knowledge; they will also contribute to collect and capitalize information as well as provide analysis and visions on specific subjects.
Higher education institutions coordinating Jean Monnet Networks have the final responsibility for their proposals. They are obliged to implement the activities described in their work programme during the entire duration of the grant."

Alliances for Innovation aim to strengthen Europe’s innovation capacity by boosting innovation through cooperation and flow of knowledge among higher education, vocational education and training (both initial and continuous), and the broader socio economic environment, including research.
They also aim to boost the provision of new skills and address skills mismatches by designing and creating new curricula for higher education (HE) and vocational education and training (VET), supporting the development of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets in the EU.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
These partnerships shall implement a coherent and comprehensive set of sectoral or cross-sectoral activities, which should be adaptable to future knowledge developments across the EU.
To boost innovation, the focus will be on digital skills as they are increasingly important in all job profiles across the entire labour market. Also, the transition to a circular and greener economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging professional needs for green skills and sustainable development.
Alliances for Education and Enterprises are transnational, structured and result-driven projects, in which partners share common goals and work together to foster innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets.
They aim to foster innovation in higher education, vocational education and training, enterprises and the broader socioeconomic environment. This includes confronting societal and economic challenges such as climate change, changing demographics, digitalisation, artificial intelligence and rapid employment changes through social innovation and community resilience, as well as labour market innovation.
Alliances for Education and Enterprises bring together enterprises and both higher education and vocational training providers to work together in partnership. Operating within one economic sector or several different economic sectors, they create reliable and sustainable relations and demonstrate their innovative and transnational character in all aspects. While each partnership must include at least one VET and one higher education organisation, they can address either both or one of these educational fields.
They intend to achieve one or more of the following aims:
Fostering new, innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning: fostering innovation in education design and delivery, teaching methods, assessment techniques, learning environments and/or developing new skills;
Fostering corporate social responsibility (e.g. equity, inclusion, climate change, environmental protection and sustainable development);
Stimulating a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial attitudes, mind-sets and skills in learners, educational staff and other workers, in line with the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (EntreComp https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC101581/lfna27939enn.pdf);
Improving the quality and relevance of skills developed and certified through education and training systems (including new skills and tackling skills mismatches);
Facilitating the flow and co-creation of knowledge between higher education and vocational education and training, research, the public sector and the business sector;
Building and supporting effective and efficient higher education and vocational education and training systems, which are connected and inclusive, and contribute to innovation.

SETTING UP A PROJECT
Each Alliance shall implement a coherent, comprehensive and variable set of interconnected activities to enhance innovation in higher education, vocational education and training and enterprises (including large, small and medium sized enterprises and social enterprises) and the broader socio economic environment.
Activities supported include:
Boosting innovation
Jointly developing and implementing new learning and teaching methods (like new multidisciplinary curricula, learner-centred and real problem-based teaching and learning, making greater use of micro-credentials);
Developing and testing continuous education programmes and activities with and within enterprises;
Developing and testing solutions to pressing social demands not addressed by the market and directed towards vulnerable groups in society; addressing societal challenges or relating to changes in attitudes and values, strategies and policies, organisational structures and processes, delivery systems and services;
Developing solutions for challenging issues, product and process innovation (through the collaboration of students, professors and practitioners).
Developing a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets, competences and skills
Developing new teaching methods and learning tools that incorporate transversal skills learning and application throughout higher education and VET programmes developed in cooperation with enterprises and aimed at strengthening employability, creativity and new professional pathways;
Introducing wherever appropriate a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in a given discipline, curriculum, course, etc. to provide students, researchers, staff and educators with the competences, skills and motivation to develop a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-set and to be able to confront various challenges in their educational, professional and private lives;
Opening up new learning opportunities through the practical experiences and application of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial competences and skills which can involve and/or lead to the launch of new services, products and prototypes, and the creation of start-ups and spin-offs;
Introducing more ""student-centred approaches"" with students tailor-making their own educational pathways.
Stimulating the flow and exchange of knowledge between higher education, VET, enterprises and research
Building inclusive and connected HE, VET systems and enterprises through mutual trust, cross-border recognition and certification, flexible pathways between VET and HE and fostering the mobility for learners and workers;
Apprenticeships and study field related activities in enterprises, which are fully embedded in the curriculum, recognised and credited; set-ups to trial and test innovative measures; exchanges of students, researchers, teaching staff and enterprise staff for a limited period; providing incentives for involvement of enterprise staff into teaching and research; analysis of research data.
Identifying resilience-related, market needs and emerging professions
Identifying market needs and emerging professions (demand side), enhancing the responsiveness of systems at all levels to labour market needs (supply side); adapting HE and VET provision to skills needs by designing and delivering transnational sector-wide curricula integrating work-based learning;
Identifying those skills that are needed in the public domain to solve societal challenges (e.g. climate change, health) and encourage resilience at societal and community level, including via the cooperation of HEIs and VET providers with national, regional and local authorities as well as the private sector to contribute to designing and implementing Smart Specialisation Strategies in regions;
Providing support to overcome the skills mismatch both for resilience and market needs.
Alliances for Innovation are required to apply EU wide instruments and tools, such as the EQF, ESCO, Europass, EQAVET and ESG, whenever relevant.
To try and test new curricula or new training and learning methods, Alliances for Innovation may organise learning mobility activities of students, teachers, researchers and staff in so far as they support/complement the main activities of the partnerships and bring added value in the implementation of the project's objectives.
EXPECTED IMPACT
Alliances for Innovation will be anchored in strategic and sustainable cooperation among vocational education and training, higher education and enterprises working together to boost the innovation capacity of Europe. They will considerably strengthen the synergies between both educational fields in fostering innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets. These Alliances among HE, VET and the enterprises are expected to contribute to the development of regional eco-systems and directly provide a valuable input to the economy, integrating workbased learning. While universities have research knowledge and data that allows them to directly provide input to small and medium sized enterprises to boost local economies, VET providers supply skills needed by enterprises and they are able to foster growth in the local economy.
At a larger scale, Alliances for Innovation are expected to target societal and economic challenges, both in education and employment, and take into account key areas such as innovation challenges, skills provision, climate change, green economy, demography, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Benefits can also be drawn from cooperation with large enterprises. The Alliances for Innovation will focus on the need of citizens and accelerate the modernization of HE and VET.
The Pact for Skills will not only establish a framework for the implementation of the other actions of the updated Skills Agenda, but also for the dissemination and exploitation of the project results of the Alliances for Innovation. In particular the results of the Blueprint Alliances for sectoral cooperation on skills will be used as a basis for the Pact for Skills sectoral large-scale partnerships.
In addition, the Alliances will help to implement the EU Communication on the Renewed Agenda for Higher Education (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017DC0247) and contribute to the creation of a European Education Area (https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area_en). They will also contribute to implement the EU Industrial and SMEs strategies (2021).
The Alliances for Innovation will also take into account the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and the Paris Declaration on Climate Change (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) as overarching parameters of the action, thus helping the European Commission to implement its new Green Deal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/european-green-deal-communication_en.pdf) and the Europe Recovery Plan (https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en).
Alliances for Innovation are meant to have a short and long term impact on the wider range of stakeholders involved, at individual, organisational and systemic level. This impact is expected to go beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations involved in the partnerships. It is expected that partnership and activities persist. For that, results/deliverables might not be stand-alone but be linked to/integrated into existing undertakings, schemes, projects, platforms, ventures etc.

JEAN MONNET ACTIONS IN THE FIELD OF HIGHER EDUCATION

The Jean Monnet Action in the field of Higher Education supports Teaching and research in the field of European Union studies worldwide.
By EU studies it is meant the study of Europe in its entirety, with particular emphasis on the EU dimension, from an internal but also from a global perspective.
The scope of EU studies can be varied so long as the EU angle is explored.
EU studies should promote active European citizenship and values and deal with the role of the EU in a globalised world, enhancing awareness of the Union and facilitating future engagement as well as people-to-people dialogue.
The Jean Monnet Action also strive to function as a vector of public diplomacy towards third countries, promoting EU values and enhancing the visibility of what the European Union stands for and what it intends to achieve.
The objectives and criteria to apply for Teaching and research are described below.

TEACHING AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
The Jean Monnet “Teaching and Research” actions will:
promote excellence in teaching and research in the field of European Union studies worldwide;  foster the dialogue between the academic world and society, including local and state level policy-makers, civil servants, civil society actors, representatives of the different levels of education and of the media;  generate knowledge and insights in support of EU policy-making and strengthen the role of the EU within Europe and in a globalised world;  reach out to a wider public and spread knowledge about the EU to the wider society (beyond academia and specialised audiences) bringing the EU closer to the public.
The action also strives to function as a vector for public diplomacy towards partner countries, promoting EU values and enhancing the visibility of what the European Union actually stands for and what it intends to achieve.
Modules: are short teaching programmes or courses in the field of European Union studies at offered at a higher education institution. Each Module has a minimum duration of 40 teaching hours per academic year for a duration of three years. Modules may concentrate on one particular discipline in European studies or be multidisciplinary in approach and therefore call upon the academic input of several professors and experts. They can also take the form of short specialised or summer programmes."

JEAN MONNET ACTIONS IN OTHER FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Learning about the objectives and the functioning of the European Union is an important part of promoting active citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination. There is a widespread lack of knowledge of the European Union and a lot of disinformation, these in turn increase people disenchantment about the Union and its policies. Teachers and trainers are keen to engage in opportunities for their own professional development; a significant number of teachers express the need to expand their competences for developing an inclusive classroom atmosphere using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and teaching in multilingual and multicultural classrooms. They also need opportunities for professional expansion regarding the European dimension of teaching at school, in particular on teaching about the European Union in engaging ways. The overall objective is to promote a better understanding, both in general education and vocational training (ISCED 1 – 4), of the European Union and the functioning of its Institutions
JEAN MONNET NETWORKS IN OTHER FIELDS OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Networks of schools and/or VET providers should serve the purpose of giving an international aspect to the new Jean Monnet strand and allow exchange of good practices as well as experiencing co-teaching within a group of countries. The activities will facilitate a common understanding on learning methodologies about European Union matters among practitioners working in different contexts, facing different challenges and constraints due the national legislations and the structure of the curricula. The objective of the networks will be twofold. On the one hand, the schools/VET providers will exchange information and practices on what and how they make their learners become more knowledgeable about the EU. On the other hand, teachers may have mobility experiences of a few days to organise and deliver co-teaching / co-tutoring with their partners.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
The Jean Monnet Networks aim to constitute the support to schools and VET providers for boosting knowledge on how to teach European Union subjects, they will also give an international edge to the learning exercise. Teachers’ exchange of knowledge (collaborative working on specific subjects and on methodologies, co-teaching experiences, common activities are the basis of the network activities. For example:
Exchanging information on content and promoting results of methodologies applied;
Enhancing cooperation between different schools/VET providers giving them international experience and a European standing;
Exchanging knowledge and mobility for co-teaching;
Fostering cooperation and creating a solid and sustainable knowledge platform among schools and VET providers."

JEAN MONNET TEACHER TRAININGS
Higher Education Institutions or Teacher Training Institutes/Agencies will organise activities under this action enabling teachers in schools and Vocational Education and Training (VET) providers to develop new skills, to teach and engage on EU matters, thus empowering them through a better understanding of the EU and its functioning. Teacher training bodies (both for initial teacher education and for continuous professional development for teachers) will strengthen their internal knowledge and skills on teaching about EU matters, and thus, leave teachers better equipped when introducing EU content in their activities. Teacher Training activities will support educational staff in schools and VET providers (ISCED 1 – 4).
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
The Jean Monnet Teacher Trainings aim to support schools and VET providers in planning, organising and delivering EU content in their curricular and extra-curricular activities. The main objectives are to:
allow schools and VET providers to build knowledge about the EU among their teaching staff;
offer structured training proposals on EU subjects for schools and VET providers, provide content and methodologies for teachers teaching at various levels, from different backgrounds and experience;
deliver specific individual or group training courses (modular, residential, blended or online) for teachers interested in the EU and willing to integrate EU subjects in their daily work;
foster the confidence of teachers in integrating an EU angle in their daily work."

SETTING UP A PROJECT
A Capacity Building project in the field of youth consists of four stages, which start even before the project proposal is
selected for funding e.g. 1) Project identification and initiation; 2) Project preparation, design and planning; 3) Project
implementation and monitoring of activities; and 4) Project review and impact assessment.

Participating organisations and participants involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages and
thus enhance their learning experience.
Identification and initiation; identify a problem, need or opportunity that you can address with your project idea in the context of the call; identify the key activities and the main outcomes that can be expected from the project; map the relevant stakeholders and potential partners; formulate the project’s objective(s); ensure the project’s alignment to the participating organisations’ strategic objectives; undertake some initial planning to get the project off to a good start, and put together the information required to continue to the next phase etc.;
Preparation, design and planning; specify the project scope and appropriate approach; outline clearly the methodology proposed ensuring consistency between project objectives and activities; decide on a schedule for the tasks involved; estimate the necessary resources and develop the detail of the project e.g. needs assessment; define sound objectives and impact indicators (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound); identify project and learning outcomes; development of work programme, activity formats, expected impact, estimated overall budget; preparing a project implementation plan and a sound and realistic communication plan including strategic aspects of project governance, monitoring, quality control, reporting and dissemination of results; defining practical arrangements and confirmation of the target group(s) for the envisaged activities; setting up agreements with partners and writing the proposal etc.;
Implementation and monitoring of activities: carrying out the project implementation according to plans fulfilling requirements for reporting and communication; monitoring ongoing activities and assessing project performance against project plans; identifying and taking corrective action to address deviations from plans and to address issues and risks; identifying non-conformities with the set quality standards and taking corrective actions etc.;
Review and impact assessment: assessing project performance against project objectives and implementation plans; evaluation of the activities and their impact at different levels, sharing and use of the project's results, etc.
HORIZONTAL ASPECTS TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN DESIGNING YOUR PROJECT:
In addition to complying with the formal criteria and setting up sustainable cooperation arrangement with all project partners, the following elements can contribute to increasing the impact and qualitative implementation of Capacity Building projects throughout the different project phases. Applicants are encouraged to take these opportunities and dimensions into account when designing their project.
Environmental sustainability
Projects should be designed in an eco-friendly way and should incorporate green practices in all its facets. Organisations and participants should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing the project, which will encourage everyone involved in the project to discuss and learn about environmental issues, reflecting about what can be done at different levels and help organisations and participants come up with alternative, greener ways of implementing project activities.
Inclusion and Diversity
The Erasmus+ Programme seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness across all its actions. To implement these principles, an Inclusion and Diversity Strategy has been devised to support a better outreach to participants from more diverse backgrounds, in particular those with fewer opportunities facing obstacles to participate in European Projects. Organisations should design accessible and inclusive project activities, taking into account the views of participants with fewer opportunities and involving them in decision making throughout the whole process.
Digital dimension
Virtual cooperation and experimentation with virtual and blended learning opportunities are key to successful projects. In particular, projects are strongly encouraged to use the European Youth Portal and the European Youth Strategy Platform to work together before, during and after the project activities.
Common values, civic engagement and participation
Projects will support active citizenship and ethics, as well as foster the development of social and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy. The focus will also be on raising awareness on and understanding the European Union context in the world.

WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?
This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for
each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the
lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in
the call.
The EU grant per project will vary from a minimum of 100.000 € and a maximum of 300.000 €.
How is the project lump sum determined?
Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following
points:
a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into ‘project management’, ‘training’, ‘organization of events’, ‘mobility preparation and implementation’, ‘communication and dissemination’, ‘quality assurance’, etc.);
b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the estimated costs showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);
d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such us dissemination of information, publishing or translation).
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals, against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action.
Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.
The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.
More details are described in the model Grant Agreement available in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP)."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The primary goal of Cooperation Partnerships is to allow organisations to increase the quality and relevance of their activities, to develop and reinforce their networks of partners, to increase their capacity to operate jointly at transnational level, boosting internationalisation of their activities and through exchanging or developing new practices and methods as well as sharing and confronting ideas. They aim to support the development, transfer and/or implementation of innovative practices as well as the implementation of joint initiatives promoting cooperation, peer learning and exchanges of experience at European level. Results should be re-usable, transferable, up-scalable and, if possible, have a strong transdisciplinary dimension. Selected projects will be expected to share the results of their activities at local, regional, national level and transnational level. Cooperation Partnerships are anchored to the priorities and policy frameworks of each Erasmus+ sector, both at European and national level, while aiming at producing incentives for cross-sectoral and horizontal cooperation in thematic areas.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
Cooperation Partnerships aim at:
Increasing quality in the work, activities and practices of organisations and institutions involved, opening up to new actors, not naturally included within one sector;
Building capacity of organisations to work transnationally and across sectors;
Addressing common needs and priorities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport;
Enabling transformation and change (at individual, organisational or sectoral level), leading to improvements and new approaches, in proportion to the context of each organisation;
SECTOR SPECIFIC PRIORITIES
In the field of youth, priority will be given to actions that contribute to the core areas of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027: engage, connect and empower young people. A particular focus will be on strengthening cross-sectorial cooperation that allows for greater synergies across different areas of actions that matter for young people, promoting youth participation in various scales and formats and supporting active citizenship of young people, notably youth at risk of social exclusion.
Specific priorities for the youth field include:
Promoting active citizenship, young people’s sense of initiative and youth entrepreneurship including social entrepreneurship: The priority aims to foster active citizenship among young people, notably through volunteering and acts of solidarity, and thereby strengthen young people's sense of initiative, particularly in the social field, and support their communities. Projects under this priority could also promote entrepreneurship, creative learning and social entrepreneurship among youth. Intercultural dialogue, knowledge and recognition of diversity and promotion of tolerance are key to this priority.
Increasing quality, innovation and recognition of youth work: The priority aims to promote the recognition and validation of youth work and informal and non-formal learning on all levels, and support quality development and innovation in youth work. This includes capacity-building of youth workers in their online and offline practices, as well as support to the development and sharing of methods to reach marginalised young people, prevent racism and intolerance among youth, and the risks, opportunities and implications of digitalisation.
Strengthening the employability of young people: The priority aims to strengthen young people’s key competences and basic skills. The youth sector plays an important role in easing the transition of young people from youth to adulthood, including supporting their integration into the labour market. Activities focusing on the inclusion and employability of young people with fewer opportunities (including NEETs), with particular emphasis on young people at risk of marginalisation and those with a migrant background, are at the core of this priority.
Reinforcing links between policy, research and practice: This priority addresses the need for stronger links between policy, research and practice in the youth field to provide improved evidence of needs and facilitate policy making. Activities to promote better knowledge about the situation of young people and youth policies in Europe and beyond will be of importance to this priority.
WHICH ARE THE CRITERIA TO BE MET TO APPLY FOR A COOPERATION PARTNERSHIP?
In order to be eligible for an Erasmus+ grant, project proposals for Cooperation Partnerships must comply with the following criteria:
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Who can apply? Any participating organisation established in a Programme Country can be the applicant. This organisation applies on behalf of all participating organisations involved in the project.
Which types of organisations are eligible to participate in the project?
Any public or private organisation, established in a Programme Country or in any Partner Country of the world (see section “Eligible Countries” in Part A of the Guide) can participate in a Cooperation Partnership. Organisations established in Programme Countries can either participate as the coordinator of the project or as a partner organisation. Organisations in Partner Countries cannot participate as project coordinators.
Irrespective of the field impacted by the project, Cooperation Partnerships are open to any type of organisation active in any field of education, training, youth, sport or other socio-economic sectors as well as to organisations carrying out activities that are transversal to different fields (e.g. local, regional and national authorities, recognition and validation centres, chambers of commerce, trade organisations, guidance centres, cultural and sport organisations).
Depending on the priority and the objectives addressed by the project, Cooperation Partnerships should involve the most appropriate and diverse range of partners in order to benefit from their different experiences, profiles and specific expertise and to produce relevant and high quality project results.
Participation of associated partner organisations
In addition to the organisations formally participating in the project (the coordinator and partner organisations), Cooperation Partnerships may also involve other partners from the public or private sector that contribute to the implementation of specific project tasks/activities or support the promotion and sustainability of the project.
Within an Erasmus+ project, these partners will be called “associated partners”. For eligibility and contractual management aspects they are not considered to be project partners, and they do not receive any funding from the Programme as part of the project. However, in order to understand their role within the partnership and have a global picture about the proposal, their involvement in the project and in the different activities needs to be clearly described in the project proposal.
Number and profile of participating organisations
A Cooperation Partnership is a transnational project and involves minimum three organisations from three different Programme Countries.
There is no maximum number of participating organisations in one partnership.
All participating organisations must be identified at the time of applying for a grant.
As a general rule, Cooperation Partnerships target the cooperation between organisations established in Programme Countries. However, organisations from Partner Countries can be involved as partners (not as applicants), if their participation brings an essential added value to the project.
Priorities addressed
To be considered for funding, Cooperation Partnerships in the field of Youth submitted by European NGOs must address either:
at least one horizontal priority
and/or
at least one specific priority relevant to the field of youth that is mostly impacted.
Venue of the activities
All the activities of a Cooperation Partnership must take place in the countries of the organisations participating in the project, either as full or as associated partners.
In addition, if duly justified in relation to the objectives or implementation of the project:
Activities can also take place at the seat of an Institution of the European Union, even if in the project there are no participating organisations from the country that hosts the Institution.
Activities involving sharing and promotion of results can also take place at relevant thematic transnational events/conferences in Programme or Partner Countries.
Duration of project
Between 12 and 36 months.
The duration has to be chosen at application stage, based on the objectives of the project and on the type of activities planned over time.
The duration of a Cooperation Partnership may be extended, upon justified request by the beneficiary and with the agreement of Executive Agency, provided that the total duration does not exceed 36 months. In such a case, the total grant will not change.
Where to apply?
To the Education, Audiovisual and Cultural Executive Agency, based in Brussels
European NGOs, sector of youth - Call ID: ERASMUS-YOUTH-2021-PCOOP-ENGO
The same consortium of partners can submit only one application and to one Agency only per deadline.
When to apply? Applicants have to submit their grant application by 20 May at 17:00:00 (Brussels time).
Eligible learning, teaching and training activities
The partnership may organise learning, teaching and training activities for staff, youth workers, learners and young people in order to support project implementation and the achievement of the project objectives.
The learning, teaching and training activities can take any form relevant for the project and may involve more than one type of participants, individually or as a group. The format, purpose and the type and number of participants in the proposed activities will be described and justified as part of the project application.
Eligible participants in learning, teaching and training activities include:
teaching and non-teaching staff such as professors, teachers, trainers and other staff working in participating organisations;
youth workers;
invited teachers and experts from non-participating organisations; - apprentices, VET learners, higher education students, adult learners, and school pupils from participating organisations;
young people from countries of the participating organisations.
sport staff members such as coaches, managers or instructors; athletes; referees
Applicant organisations will be assessed against the relevant exclusion and selection criteria. For more information please consult Part C of the Guide.
SETTING UP A PROJECT
A Cooperation Partnership project consists of four stages, which start even before the project proposal is selected for funding: planning, preparation, implementation and follow-up. Participating organisations and participants involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages and thus enhancing their learning experience.
Planning (define the needs, objectives, project and learning outcomes, activity formats, schedule etc.);
preparation (planning of the activities, development of work programme, practical arrangements, confirmation of the target group(s) of envisaged activities, set up of agreements with partners etc.);
implementation of activities;
follow-up (evaluation of the activities and their impact at different levels, sharing and use of the project's results).
Horizontal aspects to be considered when designing your project:
In addition to complying with the formal criteria and setting up sustainable cooperation arrangement with all project partners, the following elements can contribute to increasing the impact and qualitative implementation of Cooperation Partnerships throughout the different project phases. Applicants are encouraged to take these opportunities and dimensions into account when designing Cooperation Partnership projects.
Environmental sustainability
Projects should be designed in an eco-friendly way and should incorporate green practices in all its facets. Organisations and participants should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing the project, which will encourage everyone involved in the project to discuss and learn about environmental issues, reflecting about what can be done at different levels and help organisations and participants come up with alternative, greener ways of implementing project activities.
Inclusion and Diversity
The Erasmus+ Programme seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness across all its actions. To implement these principles, an Inclusion and Diversity Strategy has been devised to support a better outreach to participants from more diverse backgrounds, in particular those with fewer opportunities facing obstacles to participate in European Projects. Organisations should design accessible and inclusive project activities, taking into account the views of participants with fewer opportunities and involving them in decision making throughout the whole process.
Digital dimension
Virtual cooperation and experimentation with virtual and blended learning opportunities are key to successful Cooperation Partnerships. Projects in the field of youth are strongly encouraged to use the European Youth Portal and the European Youth Strategy Platform to work together before, during and after the project activities.

","ERASMUS Lump Sum Grants
","20 April 2021
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The European Youth Together action targets youth organisations at grass-root level which want to establish partnerships across borders, i.e. which aim at adding a European dimension to their activities and at linking these activities to EU youth policies, most notably the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027. The purpose is to encourage new applications from organisations not well established yet at European level. To this end, the action primarily consists in supporting activities aiming at connecting EU level youth organisations and grassroots NGOs operating at local levels (rural, cities, regions, countries) that will benefit from developing cross-border activities.
The overall structure of the action takes into account the growing size of the youth sector, the changing trends in youth participation and the need for more sustained and stable funding support in the youth domain161. It also takes into account the need to better cover the great diversity of youth organisations across Europe and to respond to the identified needs for both grassroots activities and large co-operation projects within Europe.
OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION
European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting cross-border partnerships that will run in close cooperation with young people from across Europe (Erasmus+ programme countries). These networks will organise cooperation, exchanges, promote trainings (for instance for youth leaders) and allow young people themselves to set up joint projects through physical and/or online activities.
Contributing to and promoting the EU Youth Goals as well as the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027162 constitute important thematic priorities for the action. The European Youth Goals are also reflected in the President von der Leyen Commission’s political guidelines163. The ongoing 18 months’ cycle164 of the Youth Dialogue and its priorities is equally a basis for this European Youth Together action.
Finally, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, responses are required to mitigate its socio-economic impact on youth, including capacity building and specific measures to deal with Covid-19 crisis recovery in the youth sector. When doing so, youth networks should consider ways of forging solidarity and inclusiveness, which concur with challenges related to digital skills and green lifestyles.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
The action seeks to specifically support:
The promotion and development of transnational structured cooperation, online and offline, between different youth organisations so as to build or strengthen partnerships focusing on solidarity and inclusive democratic participation of all;
The implementation of EU Frameworks and initiatives such as country specific recommendations from the European Semester165 as far as they relate to the youth area;
Initiatives to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and in society by organising trainings, showcase commonalities among young Europeans and encourage discussion and debate on their connection to the EU, its values and democratic foundations, including by providing a meaningful voice to youth in the framework of the Covid-19 recovery process;
The participation of under-represented groups of young people (e.g. vulnerable and socio-economic disadvantaged youth) in politics, youth organisations and other civil society organisations;
New ways to empower youth organisations in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Indicatively, this could include enhancing collaboration between youth organisations in a digital context by using relevant nonformal learning methods and organisational models including alternative modes of exchanges and mutual aid.
ACTIVITIES
The activities proposed must be directly linked to the general and specific objectives of the action and must be detailed in a project description covering the whole period of the grant as instructed in the relevant “setting up a project” section and the impact section.
Activities shall be of cross-border nature and may be performed at European (Erasmus+ Programme Countries), national, regional or local level.
Examples of relevant activities:
Activities facilitating access and participation of youth in EU policy activities taking place at all levels of a society (local, regional, national, European) as well in different institutional contexts (formal institutions, nonformal co-peration and learning, informal exchanges etc.);
Mobility activities including exchanges for the purpose of networking and/or benefitting from non-formal or informal training;
Awareness-raising, information, dissemination and promotion activities (seminars, workshops, campaigns, meetings, public debates, consultations, etc.) on EU policy priorities in the field of youth;
Foster strategic cooperation, exchange of ideas, collaborative working, and co-creation and relevant nonformal methods to shape and discuss bottom-up EU youth policy initiatives, partnerships and projects between young people, youth organisations, policy and decision-makers as well as researchers and other relevant civil society actors. This includes initiatives and events for developing Youth European NGOs/Civil Society organisations / EU-wide networks
Explore the views of politicians about young people’s proposals for democratic systems, including the views and aspirations of not-engaged youth, barriers and enablers to engagement among young people who do not have experience of existing participatory forms, and foster new spaces for youth political engagement and action across Europe.
Explore a revived understanding of the meaning and benefits of active citizenship for EU youth, including in a post-COVID context, and in light of the European Green New deal at the heart of recovery, as well as intragenerational differences in youth representation, and the changing patterns of youth representation in the EU.
Support the development of user friendly, standardised methods, tools and innovative collaboration methods for the NGO youth sector, including developing new youth community-based initiatives, skills and know-how for monitoring and evaluation of existing activities in a results driven manner, demonstrating the value of youth participation in civil society.
It is optional to include mobility activities in this action. The mobility activities for young people must underpin the main objectives of the project and offer a significant added-value to the project and to the young persons concerned.

Applicant organisations will be assessed against the relevant exclusion and selection criteria. For more information please consult Part C of this Guide.
SETTING UP A PROJECT
A ‘European Youth Together Grassroots’ project consists of four stages, which start even before the project proposal is selected for funding e.g. 1) Project identification and initiation; 2) Project preparation, design and planning; 3) Project implementation and monitoring of activities; and 4) Project review and impact assessment. Participating organisations and participants involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages and thus enhance their learning experience.
Identification and initiation; identify a problem, need or opportunity that you can address with your project idea in the context of the call; identify the key activities and the main outcomes that can be expected from the project; map the relevant stakeholders and potential partners; formulate the project’s objective(s); ensure the project’s alignment to the participating organisations’ strategic objectives; undertake some initial planning to get the project off to a good start, and put together the information required to continue to the next phase etc.;
Preparation, design and planning; specify the project scope and appropriate approach, decide on a schedule for the tasks involved; estimate the necessary resources and develop the detail of the project e.g. needs assessment; define sound objectives and impact indicators (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound);
identify project and learning outcomes; development of work programme, activity formats, expected impact, estimated overall budget; preparing a project implementation plan including strategic aspects of project governance, monitoring, quality control, reporting and dissemination of results; defining practical arrangements and confirmation of the target group(s) for the envisaged activities; setting up agreements with partners and writing the proposal etc.;
Implementation and monitoring of activities: carrying out the project implementation according to plans fulfilling requirements for reporting and communication; monitoring ongoing activities and assessing project performance against project plans; identifying and taking corrective action to address deviations from plans and to address issues and risks; identifying non-conformities with the set quality standards and taking corrective actions etc.;
Review and impact assessment: assessing project performance against project objectives and implementation plans; evaluation of the activities and their impact at different levels, sharing and use of the project's results, etc.
HORIZONTAL ASPECTS TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN DESIGNING YOUR PROJECT:
In addition to complying with the formal criteria and setting up sustainable cooperation arrangement with all project partners, the following elements can contribute to increasing the impact and qualitative implementation of ‘European Youth Together projects’ throughout the different project phases. Applicants are encouraged to take these opportunities and dimensions into account when designing their project.
Environmental sustainability
Projects should be designed in an eco-friendly way and should incorporate green practices in all its facets.
Organisations and participants should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing the project, which will encourage everyone involved in the project to discuss and learn about environmental issues, reflecting about what can be done at different levels and help organisations and participants come up with alternative, greener ways of implementing project activities.
Inclusion and Diversity
The Erasmus+ Programme seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness across all its actions.
To implement these principles, an Inclusion and Diversity Strategy has been devised to support a better outreach to participants from more diverse backgrounds, in particular those with fewer opportunities facing obstacles to participate in European Projects. Organisations should design accessible and inclusive project activities, taking into account the views of participants with fewer opportunities and involving them in decision making throughout the whole process.
As a transversal principle, participating organisations should pursue strategies to connect to young people at grassroots level from a diversity of backgrounds. This covers the involvement of a diverse youth population with fewer opportunities, including those from remote/rural areas and/or with a migrant background.
Therefore, all the activities should contribute to widening both the outreach of young people and their active engagement so as to ensure a diversity of voices are brought together.
Digital dimension
Virtual cooperation and experimentation with virtual and blended learning opportunities are key to successful projects.
In particular, projects are strongly encouraged to use the European Youth Portal and the European Youth Strategy Platform to work together before, during and after the project activities.
Common values, civic engagement and participation
Projects will support active citizenship and ethics, as well as foster the development of social and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy. The focus will also be on raising awareness on and understanding the European Union context.
EXPECTED IMPACT
The granted projects should demonstrate their expected contribution to EU youth policy by:
helping to improve the capacity of the youth sector active at grassroots level to scale up their activities and work transnationally towards building inclusiveness, solidarity and sustainability including promoting transnational learning and cooperation between young people and decision makers;
building on the objectives of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027 and more specifically by demonstrating how they are contributing to the ‘Engage-Connect-Empower’ priorities of the Strategy;
building on outcomes of the European Youth Goals, the Youth Dialogue and other youth debate projects and opinion surveys related to the future of Europe and linking them to policy development at local/regional/national/European level;
building on country specific recommendations from the European Semester as far as they relate to the youth area;
improving the involvement of young people in democratic life, in terms of active citizenship and engagement with decision-makers (empowerment, new skills, involvement of young people in project design, etc.);
upscaling existing best practices and outreach beyond local levels (rural, cities, regions, countries) and the regular network(s) including making good use of digital means to stay connected under all circumstances even in situations of remoteness, isolation or confinement;
disseminating their results in an effective and attractive way among young people involved in youth organisations, so as to pave the way for more systematic partnerships, and also among youngsters who are not
affiliated to youth structures or those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.
AWARD CRITERIA
Relevance of the project (maximum score 30 points)
Purpose and EU added value: the proposal establishes and develops a project that supports policies at EU level relevant for youth – most notably the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027. The proposal clearly demonstrates the EU added value at a systemic level, generated through its trans-nationality and potential transferability.
Objectives: the proposal objectives are relevant to the general objectives of the action and at least one of its specific objectives; moreover, the proposal objectives are specific and clearly defined, achievable, measurable, realistic and timely; they address issues relevant to the participating organisations and of a clear added value to the chosen target groups.
Needs: the proposal demonstrates that is based on a thorough needs assessment based as far as possible on verifiable facts and figures supported by general and specific data relevant to all countries and organisations in the consortium. A clear needs analysis linking to the concrete realities of applicants, partners and target groups is expected.
Youth engagement: the partnership demonstrates that it is able to secure an active engagement with a diverse youth population such as those from remote/rural areas, with a migrant background, and/or from disadvantaged social backgrounds already from the design phase of youth related activities
Quality of the project design and implementation (maximum score 30 points)
Planning: The proposal is clear, complete and of high quality and includes appropriate phases for preparation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the project based on robust project management methodologies.
Methodology: The implementation is based on suitable methodologies; the objectives are consistent with the activities and are clearly outlined, with logical links between the identified problems, needs and solutions; the work plan is coherent and concrete; there are suitable quality control measures and indicators to ensure that the project will be duly implemented with the required quality, in scope, in time and within budget; there are concrete and suitable risk management and contingency plans.
Cost effectiveness: the proposed budget is coherent, detailed enough, suited for the implementation of the project and designed to ensure the best value for money. The resources assigned to work packages are in line with their objectives and deliverables. The budget caters to the needs of grassroots organisations and vulnerable young people in order to encourage their inclusion in the Erasmus+ programme.
Quality of the partnership and the cooperation arrangements (maximum score 20 points)
Configuration: the partnership involves an appropriate mix of complementary organisations with the necessary profiles, skills, experience, expertise and management support to achieve its objectives; the added value of the for-profit organisations is clearly demonstrated, if involved in the consortium.
Geographic composition: the partnership demonstrates capacity to reflect the European economic, social and/or cultural diversity through its geographic composition (i.e. coverage of East, West, North and South areas across Europe) so as to ensure a truly pan European cooperation.
Local NGOs development: the partnership has the ability to develop the capacities and knowledge of local NGOs that are not already well established at European level to achieve enhanced peer-to-peer collaboration between NGOs across Europe.
Commitment & tasks: the distribution of responsibilities and tasks in the partnership is clear and appropriate; the coordinator shows high quality management and potential for coordination of transnational networks and leadership in complex environments.
Cooperation arrangements: the governance mechanisms proposed will ensure an effective coordination, decision-making, communication and conflict resolution between the participating organisations, participants and any other relevant stakeholders.
Youth engagement: young people are suitably involved in all stages of the project implementation and youth inclusion is addressed at all stages and levels of the project, providing empowering roles and/or concrete strategies to ensure their diverse participation.
Impact (maximum score 20 points)
Impact: the potential impact of the project on participants and partner organisations is high – in particular towards expanding the grassroots organisations’ focus of national, regional or local activities not yet cross border in nature where activities were scaled up or developed at EU level during and after the project lifetime, as well as on the youth community at large. The expected results display the understanding and capacity of the applicant and partners to communicate the European Union’s values particularly in regard to citizenship.
Dissemination: the proposal demonstrates capacity to undertake youth outreach and ability to communicate effectively on problems and solutions of the communities they represent to a broader global audience; in particular, the proposal provides a sound plan for the communication and dissemination of results and includes appropriate targets, activities and tasks distribution among partners, relevant timing, tools and channels to ensure that the results and benefits will be spread effectively to policy makers and are accessible to end users within and after the project’s lifetime.
Sustainability: the proposal clearly identifies how the outcomes of the project could contribute to changes at system level in the youth sector both within the project lifetime and beyond, with high potential to enable long lasting cooperation at EU level and/or inspire new EU youth policies and initiatives.
To be considered for funding, applications must score at least 60 points, also taking into account the necessary minimum pass score for each of the four award criteria (i.e. minimum 15 points for the categories ""relevance of the project"" and ""quality of the project design and implementation""; 10 points for the categories of ""quality of the partnership and the cooperation arrangements"" and “impact”. For ex aequo cases, priority will be given to the scores awarded for the award criterion “relevance” and then “impact”.
As a general rule, and within the limits of existing national and European legal frameworks, results should be made available as open educational resources (OER) as well as on relevant professional, sectorial or competent authorities’ platforms. The proposal will describe how data, materials, documents and audio-visual and social media activity produced will be made freely available and promoted through open licences, and does not contain disproportionate limitations.
WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?
This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call.
Maximum EU grant per project is 150,000 euros
How is the project lump sum determined?
Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following points:
a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into ‘project management’, ‘training’, ‘organization of events’, ‘mobility preparation and implementation’, ‘communication and dissemination’, ‘quality assurance’, etc.);
b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;
c) The applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the estimated costs showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);
d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such as dissemination of information, publishing or translation).
Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals, against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action.
Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.
The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.
The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.
More details are described in the model Grant Agreement available in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP)."

Objectives
Advanced Grants are designed to support excellent Principal Investigators at the career stage at which they are already established research leaders with a recognised track record of research achievements. Applicant Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal.
Size of ERC Advanced Grants
Advanced Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of EUR 2 500 000 for a period of 5 years. The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration.
However, up to an additional EUR 1 000 000 can be requested in the proposal to cover (a) eligible ""start-up"" costs for Principal Investigators moving to the EU or an Associated Country from elsewhere as a consequence of receiving the ERC grant, and/or (b) the purchase of major equipment and/or (c) access to large facilities. As any additional funding is to cover major one-off costs it is not subject to pro-rata temporis reduction for projects of shorter duration. All funding requested is assessed during evaluation.
Profile of the ERC Advanced Grant Principal Investigator
ERC Advanced Grant Principal Investigators are expected to be active researchers and to have a track record of significant research achievements in the last 10 years which must be presented in the application. There is little prospect of an application succeeding in the absence of such a record, which identifies investigators as exceptional leaders in terms of originality and significance of their research contributions.
Thus, in most fields, Principal Investigators of Advanced Grant proposals will be expected to demonstrate a record of achievements appropriate to the field and at least matching one or more of the following benchmarks:
10 publications as senior author (or in those fields where alphabetic order of authorship is the norm, joint author) in major international peer-reviewed multidisciplinary scientific journals, and/or in the leading international peer-reviewed journals and peer-reviewed conferences proceedings of their respective field;
3 major research monographs, of which at least one is translated into another language. This benchmark is relevant to research fields where publication of monographs is the norm (e.g. humanities and social sciences).
Other alternative benchmarks that may be considered (individually or in combination) as indicative of an exceptional record and recognition in the last 10 years:
5 granted patents;
10 invited presentations in well-established internationally organised conferences and advanced schools;
3 research expeditions led by the applicant Principal Investigator;
3 well-established international conferences or congresses where the applicant was involved in their organisation as a member of the steering and/or organising committee;
International recognition through scientific or artistic prizes/awards or membership in well-regarded Academies or artefact with documented use (for example, architectural or engineering design, methods or tools);
Major contributions to launching the careers of outstanding researchers;
Recognised leadership in industrial innovation."

Scope:
The ERC wishes to strengthen national and local support to potential ERC applicants, in particular to those from countries with weak participation in the ERC programme.
Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated ERC National Contact Points (NCPs) with a view to identifying and sharing good NCP practices and raising the general standard of support to ERC applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors and experiences.
The activities will be tailored to harmonise the quality of the services provided between the more and less experienced NCPs and level the quality of support provided to ERC applicants between more and less competitive countries in the ERC’s calls.
Various activities may be included, such as joint workshops, coaching, twinning/ tripling, webinars and other IT tools and fora for enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training sessions and organisation of workshops/meetings.
An integral part of the project will be the organisation of transnational workshops for coaching potential ERC applicants with all stakeholders involved in the ERC application process, and the provision of support for dedicated local ERC stakeholder events. The travel and subsistence expenses of participants should be covered for both types of event.
Special attention will be given to enhancing the competence and capacity-building of ERC NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. Building up cooperation with other relevant stakeholder networks to increase the support to potential ERC applicants will also be encouraged.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the ERC and should not overlap with actions foreseen in other NCP networks.
The actions shall be implemented under the guidance of a group comprising representatives of the NCP project, of the ERC Working Group on Widening European Participation and of the ERCEA.
The evaluation of the potential impact of the project will take into account in particular whether the consortium has a good representation of NCPs from more and less competitive countries in the ERC’s calls.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged.
The maximum duration of the project shall be for 36 months."

Objectives
ERC Synergy Grants are intended to enable minimum two to maximum four Principal Investigators and their teams to bring together complementary skills, knowledge, and resources in new ways, in order to jointly address ambitious research problems.
The aim is to promote substantial advances at the frontiers of knowledge, to cross-fertilize scientific fields, and to encourage new productive lines of enquiry and new methods and techniques, including unconventional approaches and investigations at the interface between established disciplines. This should enable transformative research not only at the forefront of European science but also to become a benchmark on a global scale.
Applicants Principal Investigators must demonstrate the synergies, complementarities and added value that could lead to breakthroughs that would not be possible by the individual Principal Investigators working alone.

","07 May 2020","Scope:
Objectives:
The ERC Proof of Concept Grants aim to maximise the value of the excellent research that the ERC funds, by funding further work (i.e. activities which were not scheduled to be funded by the original ERC frontier research grant) to verify the innovation potential of ideas arising from ERC funded projects. Proof of Concept Grants are therefore on offer only to Principal Investigators whose proposals draw substantially on their ERC funded research.
Size of ERC Proof of Concept Grants:
The financial contribution will be awarded as a lump sum of EUR 150 000 for a period of 18 months. The ERC expects that normally proof of concept projects should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, projects will be signed for 18 months. Given this initial flexibility, extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.
The lump sum offered will cover the beneficiaries' direct and indirect eligible costs for the project: if the project is implemented properly the amounts will be paid regardless of the costs actually incurred. Specifically, the lump sum has been designed to cover 100% of the eligible direct costs and indirect costs calculated by applying a flat-rate of 25% to the direct cost categories.
Profile of the ERC Proof of Concept Eligible Principal Investigator:
All Principal Investigators in an ERC frontier research project, that is either ongoing or has ended less than 12 months before 1 January 2020, are eligible to participate and apply for an ERC Proof of Concept Grant.

Deadline date","Objective:
Background and policy context
In 2020, over 15 500 children and adolescents were diagnosed with cancer, with over 2 000 young patients losing their lives to it. In fact, cancer is the principal cause of death by disease in children beyond the age of one. Up to 30% of children affected by cancer suffer severe long-term consequences. The number of childhood cancer survivors continues to grow and comprehensive care, treatment and follow-up are essential to help young patients make a good recovery and enjoy an optimal quality of life. There is a need for multidisciplinary and proactive approaches to healthy cancer survivorship, as well as for improved social networking and establishment of communication and information sharing platforms tailored specifically to young adult cancer survivors, which are well demonstrated instruments to improve the quality of life of children and young adult cancer survivors.
This action supports the implementation of the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan objective to put childhood cancer under the spotlight and implements the EU4health Programme’s general objective of improving and fostering in the Union (Article 3, point(a)) through the specific objectives in Article 4, points (a),(g) and (j) of Regulation (EU)2021/522.
Objectives pursued
The action will improve the quality of life of children and young adult cancer survivors through improved social networking and the use of a platform to improve the links amongst individuals, patients, cancer survivors, and social and health professionals active in cancer prevention and care across the Union.
Building on the experiences gained by several organisations, non-governmental organisations and cancer care institutions active in childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers, the action has the ambition of establishing the new ‘EU Network of Youth Cancer Survivors’ through federating the mentioned bodies to create a Union-wide platform to support the promotion of targeted actions and initiatives, covering the main areas which are of demonstrated benefit to improve the quality of life of young cancer survivors. The activities will be designed taking into account those key factors that may influence childhood cancer survivors’ participation in social networking and programmes tailored to their needs, such as the resources accessed by individuals through a broad range of social connections (‘social capitals of individuals’), social support, family interaction, self-efficacy and self-reported quality of life.
Children, adolescents and young adult survivors will be at the core of the actions and will be the main actors in linking with their countries and/or organisation. A conference will give the possibility to show and share the results of the activities implemented and on-going across the Union, and to discuss as widely as possible the needs and challenges. The EU Network will also be open to establish international links through direct contacts with partners outside the Union or through links with international organisations. Particular attention will be given to actions limiting the disruptive impact of cancer on the education of children and young people affected by cancer. This will happen with the involvement of patients and of formal and informal carers, on a voluntary basis.
Scope:
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
The activities funded will be as follow:
- Preparatory activities (first 6 months of the initiative). Through meetings and parallel consultations to define / agree on structure, modus operandi, secretariat, annual programme, and other operational and organisational needs, including a costing exercise of the EU Network.
- Launch of the EU Network (February 2022) – To be organised in the European Parliament and comparable to the launch of the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan in February 2021.
- Starting the activities of the Network through ad hoc missions/webinars/workshop, with the direct involvement of EU Network delegates and ‘Ambassadors’.
- First general assembly of the Network Q3 2022.
- Throughout the project, wide visibility of the actions/initiatives of the EU Network will be requested.
Expected Impact:
Expected results and impact
The action is expected to result in an expansion of the current support to improve the quality of life of young cancer survivors through networking, targeted actions, linking with existing organisations at Union and international level, and through highly visible periodical events to show the impact of the work done, and the future challenges.
The action will improve communication between children and adolescent cancer survivors, formal and informal carers, and civil society, and will strengthen the knowledge on how to better recognise the risk of getting cancer, and how to make a difference in the lives of young people with cancer and survivors, and allow them to learn how to become an advocate to bring key messages and knowledge on cancer survivorship to civil society.
Specific action-level indicators for reporting purposes
The applicants will include the following specific action-level indicators and related reporting activities in their proposals:
- number of events, meetings and discussions organised;
- number of documents produced for information and dissemination;

Background and policy context
Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan will seek to ensure that people in the Union have the right to access affordable, preventive and curative healthcare of good quality, as called for under the European Pillar of Social Rights. High-quality cancer care depends on a number of factors including access to essential medicines and innovation.
The large majority of current radiation technologies used in medicine address cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the quality and safety of these medical applications needs to be harmonised across the Union as it is evident that disparities exist in the applied level of such standards. In addition, the supply of radioisotopes used for cancer diagnosis and treatment is still not constant and subject to interruptions, therefore measures should be developed to ensure their sustainable supply, in particular in the long-term.
This action supports the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan objective to ensure high standards in cancer care and implements the EU4Health Programme’s general objective of improving and fostering health in the Union (Article 3, point (a)) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (a) and (g) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.
Objectives pursued

Cloud federation enables cloud providers to expand their business globally and easily adjust to unexpected increases in demand through dynamic resource brokerage. The dynamicity of mobile users and applications coupled with the advent of different devices and sensors make it difficult for the cloud provider to predict in advance the need for the cloud resources required to fulfil the application's requirements. Mobile cloud services require the support of very scalable cloud platforms in order to provide optimal services to mobile users especially for services and data hosted and executed across borders.
Advancements are needed in the area of Cloud Resource Brokerage that will provide effective utilization and optimization of heterogeneous resources (such as storage and communications) for mobile applications and services in federated cloud environments.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
The focus of the joint research will be the development of an innovative cloud resource brokerage platform where advanced Cloud technologies are supporting the unpredictable mobile application needs to address the challenges (i.e., heterogeneity, ultra- scalable resource provisioning & availability, computing offloading, code portability, data integrity, context-awareness, quality of service, etc.) stemming from different application domains in business and societal contexts. The technologies developed should take into account interoperability, and portability issues and aim towards future standardization. The technologies developed should be validated through relevant mobile applications requiring a federated Cloud environment, in which services and data can be hosted and executed efficiently across borders.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Credible demonstrations based on cross-border business and/or societal applications of robust interoperable technologies for mobile applications on cloud platforms.
Concrete implementations of interoperable solutions for Cloud resource brokerage technologies that are candidates for standardisation.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Even though the development of PEMFC components and stacks for transport applications have reached a mature level in which the operational performance specifications are met, certain aspects like manufacturability, production efficiency and production cost have a large improvement potential since they have not been the focus up to this point. Currently, stack production is based on a number of well-established and time efficient processes, while others are still inefficient with respect to cycle time, cost, yield and reliability. To enable a cost efficient production and thereby marketable products in the transport sector it is of paramount importance to address manufacturing and production issues.
Moreover, there are several production steps that haven’t been thoroughly investigated regarding cost reduction potential in a serial production and integration capability in automated lines.
Scope:
This topic is intended to include process development of critical steps of PEMFC stack manufacturing, including the production of component engineering samples. The topic is not intended to cover basic research on new materials nor fundamentally new cell and stack designs. Also demonstrations of full pilot lines are excluded. The fuel cell system manufacturing is explicitly excluded from this topic since it is addressed in topic FCH-01.3-2016. The overall process chain must be considered for the sake of the analysis of cycle time, covering the complete value chain including the development of inline non-destructive control tools in order to reduce the amount of defective components. Potential project proposals should have the main focus on the development of manufacturing technologies specific for PEMFC components and stacks for transport applications. The successful consortium must show evidence that critical bottlenecks specifically related to the stack and/or stack component manufacturing, including e.g. end-of-line testing and stack conditioning are addressed. The minimum TRL for stacks and stack components is 5.
Projects should achieve at least a manufacturing readiness level, MRL of 7* (Capability to produce systems, subsystems or components in a production representative environment) at project end, starting from a MRL of 5 (Capability to produce prototype components in a production relevant environment).
To demonstrate advancement with respect to the state-of-the-art on four critical parameters: cycle time, manufacturing cost, yield and reliability of the production process, project proposals are expected to cover the following top-level objectives:
Development of manufacturing technologies, beyond state of the art, specific to the PEMFC stack production processes, equipment and tools
Transpose established automotive industry best practices on production and quality to the manufacturing of PEMFC stack and stack components, such as (but not limited to) lean manufacturing, Kaisen, six sigma
Identification of bottleneck processes in stack or stack component production lines
Identification and revision of critical sub-processes (e.g. low yield/high cost)
Improvement, modification, adaptation or even new development of at least two critical stack or stack component production steps
Integration of inline non-destructive quality control tools
Adaptation of stack and/or stack components design to optimize manufacturability
Development of QA strategies relevant for the transport sector compatible with ISO/TS 16949
Duplication with already funded project VOLUMETRIQ (topic FCH-01.2-2014) should be avoided. Consortium should include at least one transport OEM and one or more stack component supplier(s), stack developer and manufacturer with existing cell/stack design and a partner specialized in manufacturing automation and production systems.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
A maximum of 2 projects may be funded under this topic.
*For more information on the use of MRL in this topic, please see Section 3.3 Call management rules
Expected Impact:
Expected impacts of the project include:
Demonstrate that with the improvements in the production process and eventually some product changes, the stack production can be increased from few 100 stacks/year up to 50,000 stacks/year in 2020, for a total power range about 5 MW per year with a single line.
Produce engineering samples of the improved design for manufacturability of at least two relevant stack components, including their product validation.
Validate in hardware, with cycle time measurement, cost analysis and statistical evaluation, the performance of the improved stack production steps.
Validate the performance of the full stack (or stack component) production in an existing production line upgraded with the optimized process steps.
Achieve components yields > 95% for the improved stack component production steps
Feedback and structure the project results into future stack and stack component development."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Driven by the demand for optimised aircraft performances, reduced operating and maintenance costs, increased dispatch reliability, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and quieter aircrafts, and the rapid growth of air traffic for the coming years, both commercial aircraft industry and general aviation are respectively pushing towards the concept of more electric aircraft (MEA) for which electricity is initially used for non-propulsive systems, and for an all-electric aircraft. As highly efficient power generation systems, fuel cell systems can play an important role in the development of the MEA concept.
Target applications range from cabin/hotel loads (5-20 kW), to emergency power units (15-50 kW), Auxiliary Power Units (superior to 50 kW) or regarding general aviation to the light aircraft propulsion systems (> 40 kW). Besides commercial aircraft industry and general aviation, electrical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have also shown interest for fuel cell technology as a key means to offer an improved endurance and range mission capability. Previous (Boeing 2008, DLR A320 ATRA 2011, Antares DLR 2009 and 2012, FCH-JU SUAV 2011) and current (FCH JU funded HYCARUS) projects have demonstrated and confirmed the potential of fuel cell technology to match aircraft needs and have helped identify main remaining challenges and bottlenecks.
Main challenges for fuel cell based energy generation systems for the aircraft industry include the fuel cell system weight and volume, the required extended lifetime and reliability to comply with aircraft operation and maintenance schedules, the ability of the technology to demonstrate compliance with the specific aerospace airworthiness certification requirements (essentially related to safety considerations) , the cost effectiveness of the corresponding fuel cell system designs and their full integration into the aircraft.
Scope:
The objective of the project is the design, development and demonstration under realistic operating conditions (TRL5-6) of an autonomous electric power generation system for non-intrusive applications for auxiliary or emergency power generation.
The consortium should be established to gather required competences and background knowledge to address the above mentioned challenges and the following key objectives:
Fuel cell system electric power output of at least 10 kW, according to target application power range;
Pure hydrogen fed fuel cell system;
Develop corresponding key components and subsystems to achieve compliance with aerospace requirements (weight and power density, safety, lifetime, materials selection, DO160, EASA CS-VLA, EASA CS23 etc) with a particular focus on key equipment such as fuel cell, air compressor and H2 storage and distribution subsystem. Later, industrialisation and target aircraft installation should be strong key drivers for any of the considered prototype developments and this should be well documented in the proposal;
Implement simulation and model-based design methodology for optimal design trade-offs (performance, durability) and definition of most suitable control strategies;
Demonstration of FC system compliance with applicable aerospace Regulations Codes and Standards (RCS) for the considered application and identification of amendments/evolutions of existing RCS when required;
Demonstration of system operation and performance under realistic operating conditions representative of the selected application mission profile (validation of operating strategies and assessment of their impact at system level);
Experimental demonstration at laboratory level of system prototype durability and assessment of system reliability and maintainability under real operation;
Perform economic assessment and derive fuel cell system Total Cost of Ownership for the selected target application including refueling and system maintenance.
Throughout the project, particular attention should be given to meet the best achievable trade-off between performance, lifetime, reliability, maintainability and system power density. Safety is hereby to be maintained at the required level. Project activities may enable even higher safety levels.
Proposals are also encouraged to consider preparation of flight test demonstrations to be conducted after completion of the project, in order to reinforce demonstration value and representativeness and better prepare for future commercialisation of the technology within the 2025 time frame.
The consortium should include at least one aircraft OEM or one Tier 1 aircraft industry OEM.
The TRL at the start of the project should be 3-4 and the project should aim to reach a TRL of 5-6 at completion.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In the context of a global reduction of emissions from the transportation sector, the decarbonization of the mid and heavy-duty (HD) truck fleets, such as those used for the transportation of goods from logistic centers to urban-based retail outlets but also those used in long-haul services represents a major challenge.
For the various needs linked to payloads and urban/suburban access requirements, the 19 to 44 (gross weight) tons range is meeting the expectations of the truck market.
Furthermore, urban areas are increasingly facing air quality degradation through, amongst other contributors, delivery trucks equipped with ICE technologies and emitting local pollutants, e.g. particulates, NOx and noise. Consequently, an increasing number of cities across Europe have decided or are in the process of deciding, to restrict access to urban areas of diesel fueled HD vehicles.
Alternative truck technologies such as battery and fuel cell technology offering adequate performance must therefore be developed and implemented to replace the diesel trucks and alleviate the emissions problems. For the required daily ranges and payloads in question, hydrogen can offer a very promising zero emission alternative. Opening the scope to 19 tons class allows the vehicles to enter the most restricted urban areas.
Scope:
The project aims at demonstrating at least 15 mid or heavy-duty (19+ tons) trucks in total, used for long-haul traffic and in interurban areas.
The trucks should fulfill the following requirements:
The powertrain should be based on hydrogen fuel cells and electric motors;
The truck should integrate a fuel cell system from 85 to 300 kW (net power), depending on the truck size and type of use;
Availability > 90% of the operation time (excluding preventive maintenance time);
The truck consumption target in kg of H2 / 100 km should be defined in the proposal;
The expected Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) should address the 19 to 44 tons Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR) truck segment;
The FCE truck should be designed to meet end-users’ needs and therefore should be able to perform the same tasks as the equivalent diesel truck, notably assure a one-day operation with one refueling or two refueling when a mid-day refueling is feasible;
For standardization reasons, the hydrogen tanks should be based on an existing standard (e.g. 350 and/or 700 bar, liquid hydrogen storage systems;
The range of the trucks should be sized according to the end-users’ needs; it is however, typically expected to be in the range of 400 to 1000 km autonomy between refuelings;
The hydrogen consumption should be provided and monitored according to the delivery routes profile.
Each site should demonstrate a fleet of minimum 4 FCE trucks and each of the related refueling station should have the adequate capacity to supply the hydrogen. Existing stations, or upgrades thereof, would be prioritized. In addition, the hydrogen production and delivery to the refueling station should reduce the FCE trucks CO2 emissions by at least 50%, as compared to the emissions of the equivalent diesel trucks, calculated on a well-to-wheel basis. The necessary trucks refueling protocol put in place should be made available to the FC and H2 community in order to log and share the experience gained.

The proposal is expected to contain minimum three different demonstration sites in at least two different countries, with a minimum of 15 trucks in operation during the project. As the focus is on long-haul, the number of trucks >26 tons should represent minimum 80% of the total.
The trucks should be operated for minimum two years (minimum of 30 000 kilometers per truck and per year), including the time to maintain and repair the trucks.
The TRL for trucks at the start of the project should be 6 and the project should aim to reach a TRL of 8 at completion.
While the operation costs that are specific to the FCE technology are considered eligible, the costs incurred by the operation, similar to the ones for the equivalent diesel solution (typically driver costs or non FCE-specific maintenance), are not eligible.
Some actors are positioning themselves to develop FCE trucks, whether being in the USA or in Europe (eg. Scania/ASKO, COOP/Swiss Hydrogen, VDL/Colruyt). In the USA we can mention the Project Portal from Toyota, Nikola trucks, Kenworth or Loop Energy. It is thus of outmost importance that Europe moves also quickly on this and the consortium should demonstrate how the proposed solution is competitive with regards to solutions mentioned here above, but also identify in which conditions the operation of the trucks could be continued after the end of this publicly funded project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 12 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 4-6 years
Expected Impact:
The project should contribute to developing a new business model on FCE trucks that has never been demonstrated beforehand, therefore specific dissemination actions should be foreseen to promote the project, share the experience gained and present the lessons learned.
The final target is to operate zero CO2 emissions, long distance transportation truck fleet, together with the refueling infrastructure and the delivery of significantly decarbonised hydrogen (according to CertifHy project recommendations [15]).
As the technology is just being implemented for the first demonstration projects, the costs associated are expected to be still important. The funding in the frame of this project is meant to fill this gap with the state of the art solution. In the frame of the project, the consortium should demonstrate how this gap is filled, based on a TCO analysis.
Existing and/or new hydrogen refueling stations will be heavily utilized thanks to the large hydrogen consumption expected for the type of truck (30 to 50 kg H2 estimated per refueling) and therefore generate a quicker learning curve that will help the deployment of the hydrogen infrastructure.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Regulations for indoor operations of vehicles and the intensified discussion on air quality for industrial areas (harbours, chemical sites, wholesale markets) demand zero emission drive trains for various kinds of vehicles. Electric vehicles are commonly regarded as the suitable answer. Considering that most operators are procuring battery electric vehicles to meet air quality regulations, the challenge for fuel cell logistic and production vehicles will be to demonstrate the distinct operating advantages of those in comparison to battery solutions. For example, battery-based solutions are often lacking a sufficient operating time in industrial applications (especially in sites with 3 working shifts or 14 hours of operation per day), need relatively long time for recharging, require precious space for the recharging infrastructure or for the storage of replaceable batteries, are unable to work in refrigerated areas and are therefore, not suitable as a replacement of conventionally propelled vehicles.
Previous EU/FCH 2 JU projects on FC based Material Handling Vehicles (MHV) like HAWL, HyLIFT-DEMO and HyLIFT-Europe and especially the success of FC forklifts in the USA (more than 20,000 units in operation) have shown the general technical feasibility on one hand and a realistic potential of an economic operation on the other. However, costs for both FC based logistic vehicles and the necessary infrastructure are still too high in comparison to battery or combustion engine-based solutions. Likewise, beyond forklifts (<3.5t) other logistic vehicles have still to be decarbonized and/or their market is not yet activated. The availability and cost argument are also the main reason why potential customers are still hesitating with procurement of FCVs. These projects have also shown that besides the cost topic there are also hurdles on the end user side e.g. when applying for the permission to install hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in buildings and training of the personnel. In order to decarbonize industrial and logistic environments, there is the need of going beyond MHVs and consider the big picture of the whole ecosystem: trucks, loaders, vans, and other specialized vehicles yet to be decarbonized. End users are also still missing certain types of FC logistic vehicles for their specific demands (max. load, outdoor suitability).
Tackling successfully this challenge presents an enormous advantage for the technology: once industry customers are convinced of the environmental and economic benefits of a FC based solution, the ecosystem can be quickly replicated in plants worldwide as typical for these manufacturing or logistic companies.
The challenge of this topic is to demonstrate that the environmental and operational benefits do materialize in a real industrial or logistic ecosystem, thus paving the way to its replication.
The project should therefore not only focus on removing existing hurdles on the cost side of the vehicles and infrastructure (Total Cost of Ownership perspective) but also on regulatory, financial and operational (e.g. availability) aspects. The following specific challenges have to be met:
1. A further reduction of the capital cost of the fuel cell logistic vehicles in line with increased volume (total and per site) by:
Eliminating technological barriers identified in previous projects such as availability and reliability;
Fully developing the necessary supply chain with focus on a healthy and diversified European value chains (e.g. drivetrain, FC stacks and systems, tanks among others) and second sources for related services, including availability of trained personnel, spare parts etc. in order to bring this technology on a parity with conventional technologies;
Designing modular and standardized systems allowing an integration to various vehicles.
2. Reduction of the operational costs, including fuel, infrastructure, down times, production shift optimization or maintenance cost;
3. Identification and quantification of the remaining barriers to market, with a special focus to the user side: permitting procedures, safety aspects (ATEX [1]), training of operators and creation of a higher acceptance of this technology;
4. Enlarging the variety of FC based MHV for special purposes which are able to operate in challenging conditions like outdoor (both in cold and very hot conditions), refrigerated warehouses, paper/cement industry (heavy loads and dusty environment) while highlighting the use cases in which FC vehicles are advantageous compared to existing battery solutions;
5. Creation of a basis for future larger procurements like common specifications and standards for both vehicles and infrastructures, establishment of cross-border procurement groups etc.;
6. Creating synergies with already existing green hydrogen production facilities or development and demonstration of an onsite-production of green hydrogen, which is commercially feasible also for SMEs. Operators could also benefit from the existing supply chain of green hydrogen.
[1]: The term ""ATEX"" applies to atmospheres that are potentially explosive due to the possible presence of dusts vapours or gases that are likely to ignite or explode (https://www.hsa.ie/eng/Topics/ATEX_and_Electrical_Apparatus/Atex_Regulations_-_Frequently_Asked_Questions/)
Scope:
Projects should demonstrate at least 250 fuel cell logistic vehicles such as forklifts, trucks, vans, loaders or other relevant industrial vehicle at two end-user sites with a minimum of 50 vehicles per site. The sites should be chosen such that different operational scenarios (e.g. type of goods produced, indoors/outdoors, cold/hot climate, dusty environment, etc) are demonstrated. One single site for the demonstration could also be considered to demonstrate the impact of a higher critical mass of vehicles in one location. Reasons for the choice of site(s) should be explained by the applicants/consortium.
The project should be open to different industries such as and not limited to logistic hubs, car industry, ports and airports, refrigerated warehouses, heavy industry or ceramic industry. The vehicles can also operate outside the site grounds but should be connected to the logistic process of that site.
The demonstration should include necessary and relevant support of cost-efficient hydrogen supply infrastructure and the hydrogen generated should be green hydrogen (i.e. from biomass or from electrolysis based on renewable energy) at least in one of the locations.
It is expected that the vehicles to be deployed in all sites fulfil the following conditions:
Vehicle type A: trucks (gross vehicle mass >3.5t) or tow tractors (load carriers) for net loads >3t - minimum of 10 units and at least 3 units per site;
Vehicle type B: vans, small trucks (gross vehicle mass <3.5t) or tow tractors (load carriers) for net loads <3t - minimum of 10 units and at least 3 units per site;
Vehicle type C: logistic vehicles, of all weight classes, which either a) have not yet been previously converted to zero-emission or b) work currently with batteries but whose operation with fuel cells is deemed more advantageous and where the conversion is required (forklifts for net loads >3.5t could be also included) - minimum of 10 units and at least one unit per site;
Vehicle type D: forklifts for net loads <3.5t - minimum of 30 units and at least 3 units per site.

Although the proposed topic includes the powertrain integration of FC systems in vehicles in which a fuel cell system has not yet been integrated, it should not include however the development of the powertrain components. The technology to be installed in the vehicles should reflect and go beyond the achievements from the previous FCH 2 JU supported projects (HyLift-Demo, HyLift-Europe, HAWL etc) and should represent the newest state-of-the-art from the EU supply chain. Development of further FC logistic vehicle platforms and the adaptation to certain ambient condition could be also in scope of this topic. In order to assess the reliability, performance and availability of HRSs, vehicles and the overall operation, a data monitoring and analysis system should be put in place. This data should extract value for the next technology generation as well as for the logistic operation itself.

The project is expected to reach the following requirements in terms of performance and safety:
Operation under application specific indoor/outdoor environmental conditions including cold/freezing ambient conditions, freeze start capability at -20°C on system level. Data monitoring and evaluation should be installed to evaluate the influence of different operation conditions on the performance;
1, 2 and 3 shift or 14 hours daily operation scenarios should be demonstrated;
LCA (‘cradle to grave’) of environmental performance of vehicles, infrastructure and energy source. Assessment should be carried out according to the requirements of the FC-HyGuide guidance document available at http://www.fc-hyguide.eu;
The required hydrogen refuelling station should be designed and operate in high utilization scenarios under strict availability requirements (> 98% from planned operation time);
FC systems eligible for funding should address specific European safety standards such as EN 62282-2:2012 Fuel cell technologies - Part 2: Fuel cell modules and EN 62282-4-101:2014 FC Systems Industrial Trucks Safety or EC79/2009 Hydrogen-powered Motor Vehicles as well as have to be CE marked or certified according to applicable EU directives for off-road and on-road vehicles
The competitiveness (on TCO basis) in comparison with incumbent technology or state-of-the-art technologies (ICE, LA/LI battery) at the fleet level for a specific site, should include investment, maintenance and service expenses, hydrogen consumption, other operational costs and disposal/recycling. “CertifHy Green H2“guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform to ensure that the hydrogen consumption is of renewable nature.

As regards harmonization of regulatory framework:
In case two sites are chosen, it would be advantageous to be selected from two EU countries in order to be able to evaluate differences in the regulatory framework for both the permitting of the operation of hydrogen-propelled vehicles and of the installation of a hydrogen-refuelling infrastructure in buildings;
Differences and hurdles should be identified, safety criteria and concepts for indoor operation and refuelling of trucks, vans or MHVs as basis for standardization shall be developed and proposals for an EU wide harmonization be made.
The minimum operational period for any vehicle demonstrated in the project should be at least:
Vehicle type A: 24 months and 30,000 km (trucks); 24 months and 2,500 hours of operation (tow tractors);
Vehicle type B: 24 months and 30,000 km (vans and small trucks; in particular, 36 months should be considered for vans); 24 months and 2,500 hours of operation (tow tractors);
Vehicle type C: 12 months and 1,000 hours of operation;
Vehicle type D: 36 months and 4,000 hours of operation.
Refuelling infrastructure (new installation or upgrade of existing one and/or optimized refuelling procedure, e.g. through robot) as well as green hydrogen generation capabilities should be also in scope of the project.
FC systems should be analysed for power degradation and efficiency over the operation period.
The project results should be presented to at least two relevant international events raising the awareness of potential customers and/or policy makers for this technology.
It is expected that consortium comprises end users at each site committing themselves to demonstrate a minimum of 50 MHV and industrial vehicles at the start of the project and at least two vehicle manufacturers and hydrogen infrastructure suppliers. The commitment should be secured by at least Letter Of Intent (LOI) in the proposal and by way of pre-orders or similar before signature of the Grant Agreement. The participation of a research organisation or academia is also recommended.
TRL at the start of the project:
Vehicle type A: 5-6
Vehicle type B: 5-6
Vehicle type C: 4-5
Vehicle type D: 7-8
TRL at the end of the project:
Vehicle type A: 6-7
Vehicle type B: 6-7
Vehicle type C: 6
Vehicle type D: 8-9
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 10 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
In order to increase the leverage effect of the FCH 2 JU contribution, the possibility of co-funding from national/regional initiatives could be considered.

Expected duration: 4 - 5 years.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
It is expected that vehicle architectures will change significantly in the next few years due to major trends in the automotive industry: the increase of electro mobility based on battery technology, which demands flat design spaces in car underbodies and the increasing technology readiness level of autonomous driving, which causes significant vehicle transformations including use of car interiors. Passengers will require space for free movement, which implies among other changes, body structures without central tunnel.
Today gasoline and diesel vehicles share the same installation spaces. Similarly, it would be extremely beneficial if hydrogen drive and battery systems could also share the same vehicle architecture. The integration of both energy systems in the same car body would enable economies of scale, simplify and reduce engineering and manufacturing processes and allow flexible production, which could buffer demand fluctuations. Due to the expected above changes in future car bodies, installation spaces designated for the integration of energy storage cannot be used efficiently with conventional type IV hydrogen cylinders tanks.
The major challenge today is the integration of hydrogen storage systems that fulfil customers’ autonomy range expectations. Development of novel and innovative tank concepts is therefore necessary, in order to be able to integrate hydrogen drive systems into after-2020 future vehicles. The main challenge consists of packaging high pressure hydrogen storage vessels (which used to have cylindrical geometries in conventional pressure vessels) into a rectangular shape for battery spaces while complying with current type-approval regulations EC 79/2009 [20] and UNECE Regulation No.134 [21]. Finding a tank design concept while fulfilling requirements for certification as well as realizing a high storage volume for acceptable vehicle ranges is one of the main obstacles.

[21] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.129.01.0043.01.ENG
Scope:
The core goal of this project is the development and validation of an innovative hydrogen 70 MPa tank system in a conformable shape that can be integrated in light-duty vehicles with flat architectures, unsuitable for conventional cylindrical Type IV (Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel, COPV) tanks.
The new storage system concept should take into account especially industrial manufacturability, mechanical safety, low permeation, fire resistance, low costs, high gravimetric and volumetric efficiency, and meet type approval requirements. It should also be compatible with SAE J2601 [22] and allow fast refueling according to SAE J2601 refueling protocols.
It is expected that the new storage system would need to fit into a design space of 1800 x 1300 x 140 mm³. The geometry and concept of the tank system is however not defined yet. The system can consist of one or more separate vessels that are linked in order to form the tank system.
The project should address the analysis, simulation, hardware validation and the Computer-Aided Design, CAD-based vehicle integration of the chosen concept.
It is expected that at least 10 prototypes will be built-up and major performance tests will be conducted in order to validate the concept according to current type-approval regulations. If a concept is chosen such that it shows a tank system consisting of several identical vessels linked to form the tank system, one prototype means one vessel; a vessel defines a closed containment with a separate valve.
The following tests are expected to be performed:
Non-destructive geometric/gravimetric characterization (on at least 2 prototypes);
Burst pressure (on at least 3 prototypes);
Pressure cycle tests (on at least 3 prototypes);
Permeation (on at least 1 prototype);
Fire resistance (on at least 2 prototypes);
The project should contribute to safety and type-approval standards for conformable hydrogen vessels (especially critical tests like drop and impact test).
TRL at the start of the project: 2 and TRL at the end of the project: 4.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
The consortium should consider collaborating with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) and using its High Pressure Gas Tank Testing Facility (GASTEF) for conducting hydrogen cycle tests to complement the performance tests requested above.
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
[22] https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j2601_201003/
Expected Impact:
The project should represent a new approach of mobile hydrogen storage in the EU and, if successful, will generate a true breakthrough, opening the door of the FCEV technology for all types of future vehicle concepts. A prototype would then need to be developed and built within the envelope of the installation space, and the project should result in:
Prototypes designed for storing hydrogen gas at a nominal working pressure of 70 MPa;
Developing an understanding for main requirements in future design space;
Understanding of manufacturing hurdles and solutions;
Demonstration that future fuel cell electric vehicles can share vehicle architectures with battery electric vehicles;
Better understanding for temperature changes inside the pressure vessels with new geometries due to hydrogen fueling and defueling;
Necessary steps for certification and standardization of investigated pressure vessel geometries should be shown (especially critical tests like drop and impact test).
The project should measure its impact through the following KPIs:
Volumetric efficiency (according to the FCH 2 JU target for 2024):
Within the H2 tank system > 0.033 kg H2/L system;
Within the estimated design space (1800 x 1300 x 140 mm³) > 45 % (stored H2 volume within design space volume);
Gravimetric efficiency (according to the FCH 2 JU target for 2024) > 5.7 %;
Costs for tank system < 400€/kg H2;
Permeation < 46 cm³/h/l at 55 °C (according to UNECE Regulation No.134);
No leakage or burst of the vessel may occur under an engulfing fire affecting the whole tank at a temperature higher than 590 °C for a duration of at least 10 minutes, according to UNECE Regulation No.134;
Burst pressure > 157.5 MPa (according to UNECE Regulation No.134);
Hydraulic pressure cycle test: no leakage before 11,000 cycles and no burst before 22,000 cycles at 87.5 MPa (according to UNECE Regulation No.134).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European urban areas are increasingly facing deterioration of their air quality. Among other contributors, urban trucks performing a number of services are emitting local pollutants (CO, NOx, PM, HC) which cause bad air quality. Thus, from a healthcare perspective, local pollution in urban areas and city centers are becoming a growing concern for an increasing number people and public authorities.
At the same time a drastic GHG reduction of emissions in the growing road freight sector is needed to meet long term climate and energy targets..
With the hope to quickly improve air quality, several big European cities have already decided to limit the access to urban areas of diesel-fueled heavy duty-vehicles. Many others are considering applying the same approach. However, this strategy risks to increase the number of conventional light commercial vehicles circulating in city centers, generating traffic congestion and, consequently, worsening tail-pipe emissions of toxic pollutants.
Therefore, local authorities expect that industry makes available advanced and more sustainable solutions for urban logistics, including innovative zero emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
In this context, the first “all-electric” truck prototypes (powered exclusively by batteries) have been evaluated in Europe. The main conclusion of such experimentation trials is that these vehicles have largely insufficient driving range. Payload penalty and charging time are also major issues, penalizing profitability for loaders and making very unlikely the commercial success of this kind of vehicles.
Fuel Cell technologies may dramatically improve the driving range of these vehicles providing the operational attributes necessary to replace diesel trucks. A fuel cell truck should have the same daily operation behavior and payload as its diesel version (e.g. refuelling time), while proposing an acceptable payload in comparison with an “all-electric” vehicle.
Scope:
The topic calls for deployment and demonstration of Fuel Cell urban truck fleets, where urban truck stands for a truck having a Gross Vehicle Weight between 3.5 tons and 20 tons, which performs daily back-to-base mission within an urban area.
The project should cover the manufacturing, deployment and evaluation by real end-users in a real operating environment of a series of at least 10 urban trucks and the related infrastructure. The trucks should be deployed in at least two major European cities willing to improve their urban logistics via the utilization of innovative transportation solutions.
FC trucks
The fuel cell truck should be derived from a hybrid or electric platform to limit the risks linked to the electrification of the whole power train and the integration of the fuel cell system and can be equipped with a battery in order to manage energy braking recovery and power demand peaks.
Nevertheless, it is required that the fuel cell and hydrogen system provides at least half of the energy needed for performing its daily duty.
The trucks should be designed to meet end-users’ needs and the behavioral features of the conventional trucks usually circulating in the cities hosting the project.
The cities shall ensure a high involvement in promoting these technologies, and in particular, facilitating the deployment and the exploitation of the new urban trucks.
The fuel cell trucks are expected to comply with the following requirements:
>20,000h vehicle operation lifetime initially, minimum 25,000h lifetime as project target
The key power source of vehicles must be a fuel cell system or an hybrid solution with a battery and a fuel cell range extender
Fuel cell system MTBF >2,500 km
Availability >90% (to be measured in available operation time)
Tank-to-wheel efficiency >42%, for trucks measured in real cycles.
Series production ability has to be shown
It will be important to demonstrate that the fuel cell trucks will be able to fulfill requirements for urban delivery, assuring one day of operation without refill.
The funding per truck should be the lesser of 1500€/kW installed FC system or 300,000 €
The minimum operational period for any truck demonstrated in the project is 24 months.
HRS
The project should also include hydrogen refuelling stations with suitable capacities to meet the operational requirements of an urban truck fleet of at least 5 units.
The challenge is to maintain high levels of station availability, identify the right level of system redundancy and ensure fuel availability during the entire year.
HRS are expected to comply with the following requirements:
HRS are to be designed to allow for supply of at least 5 urban trucks daily for cost effective HRS operation.
A target availability of the station of 98% (measured in usable operation time of the station providing redundancy for service and maintenance) should be adopted
Inclusion of the HRS designs developed under earlier programmes (including the 2014 call) to show integration of concept and cost down potential of hydrogen production and storage for larger fleets as well as the potential to scale up capacity.
The cost of dispensed hydrogen offered in the project needs to be consistent with the national or regional strategy on hydrogen pricing. Cost improvements due to increased hydrogen production capacity and especially higher utilization rates of the HRS is anticipated in the course of the project (target at the pump < 9 €/kg excl. taxes)
The maximum funding per HRS is 400,000 €, excluding on-site production equipment.
Overall
Beyond demonstration of the technology the participating cities shall ensure the communication of their efforts to other cities/regions in Europe and beyond and use appropriate channels/fora to share their experience within the project.
Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html.
It is recommended that the project is co-funded by national, regional or private sources in order to demonstrate a strong commitment towards clean propulsion and emission free public transport. Co-funding needs to be fully secured before the signature of the grant agreement to ensure timely realisation of the project.
Proposers should provide a clear evidence of:
political support for the project together with commitment to further involvement in the roll out must be provided as part of the proposal, through a Letter of Intent
a comprehensive exploitation-plan for the project should also form part of the proposal.
The consortium should include trucks fleet providers/operators, trucks OEMs and FC systems integrators, refuelling infrastructure operators, fuel retailers, industrial players, local and regional bodies, as appropriate and relevant to the effective delivery of the programme. The involvement of SMEs is highly encouraged. To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping.
The following TRLs are at least required:
6 for the mid-range trucks at start of project
7 for the HRS at start of project.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million per project. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 4-5 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the project provides a significant step towards successful market introduction of FC trucks by reducing their cost significantly while increasing their maturity, reliability and lifetime. It is also expected that by using FC systems (preferably already demonstrated successfully in FC-passenger cars) in other road transport applications, like trucks and vans, the uptake of FC technology and cost reduction of FC and FC system components is significantly increased.
Hydrogen refuelling stations for larger fleets of will be heavily utilised and therefore generate a bigger learning effect in comparison to underutilised stations for other applications. This is a precondition on the pathway towards commercial operation of refuelling infrastructure. It shall increase the confidence of fleet operators in reliable fuel supply and demonstrate the viability of fuel cells for trucks. Furthermore it is expected that the new fleet stations contribute to the build-up of a European-wide hydrogen refuelling network.
The project should identify and disseminate:
Lessons learnt from implementing and operating urban trucks for early adopters
Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the impact of the technology on public health and urban living (e.g. comparison against incumbent technology, in situ measurement etc.)
Professional dissemination of information on the activities of the project to the broad public is seen as a key part of the demonstration project. It should especially be foreseen to communicate the benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells in public transport. Regional authorities should support the project with communication."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
PEMFC system technology has demonstrated its maturity for automotive application, but still does not meet the cost requirements for a broad market introduction. The reasons are diverse, including proprietary system architectures and component concepts, low volume and lack of a competitive chain of suppliers. Standardisation of interfaces and system components is considered to be an efficient pathway to reduce cost, accelerate market introduction of automotive fuel cell technology. Moreover development and qualification of a capable European supplier base is of major importance to strengthen Europe's competitiveness in the emerging international market for fuel cell electric vehicles.
For the sake of clarity, by standardisation is meant the development of common components and their interfaces and not the developments of new standards and regulations.
Whereas standardisation of refuelling infrastructure is approaching maturity, on the fuel cell system component level the variance is still very high and needs more alignment. Each manufacturer of a fuel cell system typically develops and uses its own components and interfaces, mainly based on proprietary requirements, whereas the similarity of requirements appears to be high (compare with “Auto Stack”* specification).
*FCH JU funded project AutoStack; http://autostack.zsw-bw.de
Scope:
Components suitable for OEM-wide standardisation include air supply, fuel supply, valves, sensors, cooling, water management, DC/DC converters, current connectors, etc. In addition, some of these components affect safety classification of fuel cell systems and must be qualified and tested in order to comply with Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL*) standards. Differentiation between OEMs is expected with regard to fuel cell architecture, fuel cell stack and system controls and, therefore, these should not be the focus of the project.
Successful proposals must address the following objectives:
identify and select a minimum of three components or subsystems suitable and relevant for standardisation
align specifications and interfaces for each component and subsystem
define and agree on standardized verification, validation and qualification test protocols
benchmark components and subsystems in conjunction with their operating range with the state-of-the-art. This includes testing of available market components and engineering samples from project partners
develop and build the selected components and test them against the agreed specifications
generate inputs for further development of advanced PEMFC system components in order to fulfil broader requirements of OEMs
if meaningful, liaise with relevant ISO and IEC committees and transfer of recommendations for standardized system components and subsystems to industry codes & standards
assess the cost impact upon standardisation
The consortium should include at least two automotive OEMs, a fuel cell system integrator, and relevant suppliers to the automotive industry capable of fulfilling automotive standards. To strengthen the industry consensus and acceptance of the proposed component standardisation, participation of further OEMs and main automotive suppliers is highly recommended, even if only with an observer role. The components to be standardized are expected to be at least TRL 4 at the start of the project and TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million each would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
*ASIL is a risk classification scheme defined by the ISO 26262 - Functional Safety for Road Vehicles standard
Expected Impact:
The expected impact must include:
Industry supported recommendations for aligned interfaces and specifications for key PEMFC system components
At least three PEMFC system components or subsystems modified, adapted and built to the recommended specifications/interfaces, including the component validation in an existing complete PEMFC system
A set of standardised verification, validation and qualification test protocols for selected components
Transparency on the reduction of development and manufacturing costs leveraged by standardisation
Clear added value for the competitiveness of the European component supplier base
Reduced certification efforts based on dissemination of a white paper for industrial standards"

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Despite significant improvements achieved over the recent years, the level of utilisation of both Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) and Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS) remains well under the level currently experienced with conventional technologies.
For FCEVs, the low level of utilisation is defined in terms of limited number of vehicles being in operation in the field and of limited number of kilometres driven per year, thus limiting conditions in usage allowing for a real field experience to be gained.
For HRS, typical utilisation rates are in the range of 5 to 10% on average compared with the 90%+ level encountered in forecourts distributing more conventional fuels. Limitations in improved HRS technology reliability and operations are therefore faced.
This situation is calling for a large scale “market test” with sufficient vehicle numbers per station to generate relevant data based on demonstration of the HRS under high load conditions. Moreover, the project will target a B to B market, gaining experience in higher mileage and more bearable business case for the infrastructure operator. Building on the achievements obtained today through the launch and follow-up operations of large scale FCEVs and HRS demonstration projects [1], it is now necessary to revisit the conditions of such demonstrations in order to allow a pre-commercial evaluation of the FCEVs & HRS technologies.
With respect to the above, consideration to controlled fleets operators can provide such necessary conditions. Fleets of vehicle are also attracting increased attention from public authorities and private stakeholders involved in transport decarbonisation.
[1] Such as the FCH2 JU funded projects HyFive, H2ME and H2ME2 in Europe
Scope:
This topic calls for a large scale pre-commercial demonstration project covering of FCEVs and HRSs under high utilization conditions such as those encountered by commercial fleets operators.
Vehicles
For vehicles, the project will consist in identifying at least two operators of commercial fleets of vehicles such as, but not limited to, taxis, light commercial vehicles parcel delivery services but also potentially new mobility services such as car sharing.
The identified fleet operators will cover the roll-out of at least 180 FCEVs in total with a minimum deployment of 60 FCEVs per site / geographical location, in at least 3 sites.
The vehicles can comprise OEM supplied passenger cars and utility vehicles (light duty vans). The FCEVs are expected to be using a fuel cell system as the key power source and 70MPa storage.
The minimum operation for vehicles is 90 000 km per vehicle within the project with annual mileages equal to the average values observed currently for the equivalent vehicles performing comparable services, running on more conventional fuels. Commercial arrangements for extending operations after the end of the project are expected to be provided.
HRS
In this topic, the focus is on demonstrating the feasibility to operate HRS under pre-commercial conditions in terms of utilization rate.
The minimum number of HRS needed to fulfil the H2 demand and the geographical coverage of the FCVs fleet operated at a given location must be considered.
The HRS must be designed to investigate the specific problems arising from the need to provide high volumes of hydrogen per day while offering satisfactory service to HRS customers in terms of refuelling duration per vehicle and availability (back to back refuelling performance).
When addressing the utility vehicle market or local fleets (as is the main intent of this topic), HRS facilities may be located on private grounds, with or without public access. The latter should be favoured, as long as several other customers are identified as long term users of the HRS. Whenever appropriate to the fleet operators, the use of existing HRS, for example HRS being deployed for FCH JU projects, must be considered subject, when required, to the implementation of upgrades designed to bring the performances of the HRS in line with the users' expectations.
The targeted operation for the HRS is at minimum 5 years (operation beyond the project life is expected and should be demonstrated in the proposal).
Safety assessment shall include the social acceptance dimension.
Overall
Measurement, monitoring and evaluation of specific vehicle and fuelling station parameters should be done using methodologies such as those used in current projects funded by the FCH JU1. The project shall prepare for the use of low-carbon hydrogen and aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the hydrogen refuelled by at least 50% on a well-to-wheel basis as compared with new gasoline and diesel vehicles. The results of the CertifHy Project should be taken into account in the analysis of the total well-to-wheel emissions.
A formal, inclusive and creative dissemination programme is required which ensures that the lessons learnt by the project are made available to wider public. In particular, it should be ensured that countries considering development of similar FCEVs/HRS roll-out initiatives should have an easy access to information generated by the consortium.
Proposal may include some provision for funding support to existing HRS upgrades (performance and availability/reliability focus)
Proposers should provide a clear evidence of:
A comprehensive strategy for commercialization, including (novel) ways to attract the customers by appropriate customer value proposition scenarios
An evidence of political support for the project together with commitment to further involvement in the roll out must be provided as part of the proposal, through a Letter of Intent
Justification of the way in which the project will contribute to de-risking commercialization of FCEVs in Europe
A comprehensive business-plan for the project should also form part of the proposal. Where contributions from end users to vehicles’ costs are assumed, this should be clearly indicated in the project proposal
The consortium should include vehicle fleet operators, , refuelling infrastructure providers and operators, and other actors as appropriate and relevant to the effective delivery of the programme.
The following TRLs are at least required:
8 for FCEVs at start of project and 8 - 9 at the end
7 for the HRS at start of project and 7 – 8 at the end.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million per project. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 6 years with minimum 4 years of operation
Expected Impact:
The learning experience obtained is specifically intended to trigger further technological improvements of both stations and vehicles and to provide the necessary experience and confidence on the part of investors and policy makers in the business plans for the multi-billion euros of investments needed to establish the HRS infrastructure required for mass market roll-out.
Therefore priority will be given to proposals presenting a comprehensive programme to gather new learning from the project in terms of: customer acceptance, techniques for the operation of a station network, business models for national HRS roll-out, FCEV reliability operated at a high mileage level, technology performance (and requirements for improvement, using the HyLights methodology.
Vehicles
At least 80% of the vehicles to be deployed in the project should be designed to meet the requirements resulting from the severity of usage facing the fleets (e.g. availability, durability)
Technical targets for vehicles:
>6,000h vehicle operation lifetime
The key power source of vehicles must be a fuel cell system (full traction FCEV)
Vehicle range > 500 km
Availability >98% (to be measured against available operational time)
Tank-to-wheel efficiency >45%, measured in the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC)
The funding contribution will not exceed 20 k€ per vehicle.
HRS
Assessment of progress towards overcoming the barriers to the roll-out of FCEVs (it is expected that substantial advances in comparison to the state-of-the-art to five of nine of the issues below will be proposed and trialled in the project):
Quality Assurance issues around hydrogen purity: Progress towards definition of an industry acceptable hydrogen quality compliance system is targeted. Current investigations made at ISO level to be followed.
Achieving a high level of availability for HRS: Improvements towards 98% HRS availability
Improved efficiency/performance for HRS:
level of back to back vehicle performance to be defined as function of the fleet operational constraint
Increased availability of hydrogen from renewable sources: level of targeted decarbonization of the hydrogen fuel must be defined according to the national/regional sustainable on-going production roadmap(s) (whenever available.)..
Furthermore, HRS are expected to comply with the following requirements:
High capacity HRS facilities are encouraged for fleet refuelling. The minimum refuelling capacity should be 200 kg of daily refuelling capacity for all stations. Back-up solutions to be considered and clearly described.
The cost of dispensed hydrogen offered in the project needs to be consistent with the national or regional strategy on hydrogen pricing. Cost improvements due to increased hydrogen production capacity, and especially higher utilization rates of the HRS, is anticipated in the course of the project. On the other hand the efforts required to lower the carbon footprint could offset these improvements. Thus, the target at the pump is fixed at 10€/kg excl. taxes.
The fulfilment of the ISO standard 14687-2 is not compulsory for the Hydrogen purity and has to be at least 99.999 % but the actual quality of refuelled hydrogen shall be duly controlled and justified with regards to fuel cells performance preservation.. Vehicle refuelling process must comply with SAE J2601 (2014) and IR communication needs to comply with SAE J 2799. Exceptions may be allowed, if justified by the application."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The present PEMFC stack technology for automotive application shows limitations (performances, durability, production cost) which appear to be difficult to overcome by incrementing each component such as membrane, catalyst or MEA. In order to reach the OEMs targets and to prepare the next generation of stack for transport applications and in order for Europe to stay competitive versus North America or Asia, new disruptive stack concepts are needed involving new stack architecture, new materials and new processes.
For a next generation with higher performance new concepts considering the stack as a whole and no more as the sum of individual components have to be investigated. In this approach, each stack component will be designed and optimized simultaneously, as part of a more complex system.
Scope:
To develop a higher performance stack for automotive application, all components (BBP, GDL, MPL, electrodes, and membrane) have to be designed accordingly, in a full size single cell approach. For this purpose, there has to be a focus on interface optimisation between components where new material and processes will have to be investigated, in order to optimise performance and durability while decreasing production cost. An integrated solution at the single cell level is highly recommended.
Beyond performance increase, thanks to new design and associated processes, new stack architecture allowing a simplified BOP will be privileged in order to have a global system approach for system cost reduction. As an example, new stack concept working at lower pressure without compressor is among the possible solution.
New innovative material solutions (such as new membrane) will be also a disruptive way to be associated to the previous challenge.
Furthermore, new concepts for stack integration and interfaces with BOP will have also to be investigated (integrated terminal plates, innovative connection with BOP…).
The selection between best material/process solutions should be justified and documented, possibly through modelling.
TRL start: 2 and TRL end: 3.
The consortium should include component and stack suppliers, component-testing organisations. The project should build on the activities and results reached in previous or existing FCH 2 JU projects, e.g. Autostack or Autostack Core projects, dealing with stack and stack component development.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
Expected Impact:
The main impacts to be addressed are the following:
Power density > 2 W/cm2 at 0.66 V;
Volumetric power density > 5 kW/l at nominal power;
Specific power density > 4 kW/kg at nominal power;
Durability: > 6,000 hours;
Stack production cost < 20 €/kW (for > 100 000 units/year);
Stack max operating temperature of 105 °C;
The outcome will be at least a short-stack (minimum power 5 kW), to be tested with AST protocol representative for at least 6 month real operative conditions.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Shipping contributes significantly to local air pollution in major harbour areas and around 3% of global CO2 emissions. Shipping is bound to grow together with global trade and against other sectors decarbonising more quickly. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has found that GHG emissions from ships have already increased by 70% since 1990 [33] and the European Commission strategy [34] estimates that without action the global share of shipping's GHG emissions may reach 17% by 2050. IMO has set a 50% reduction target for emissions related to maritime transport by 2050 compared to 2008, and an ambition of full decarbonization by 2100. In this context, the shipping market is forced to identify more sustainable fuels on the route to full decarbonisation and adopt new technologies for on-board energy conversion for all its fields (cargo, passenger ferries, cruise, service/supply vessels…).
Hydrogen as a fuel can enable zero-emission shipping in both GHG and pollutant emissions. However, the volumetric energy density of gaseous hydrogen is a limiting factor in terms of range which is critical for several types of ships. Hydrogen in its liquid form at approx. 20Kelvin (LH2) is a promising solution to address this issue but little knowledge related to the handling and use of LH2 within the shipping sector exists today due to a lack of demonstration projects. In turn, it hampers the progression of its inclusion in relevant regulations. Similarly, managing LH2 within a port environment (where industrial clusters users of hydrogen are often found) is yet to be demonstrated, with its subsequent learnings.
There are currently several challenges associated with using liquid hydrogen as a fuel in shipping:
The total system's energy and power density as well as redundancy should be adequately secured for the specific applications;
Not sufficiently mature/developed regulations, codes and standards (RCS), apply currently to hydrogen-related technologies in maritime environment. The time-consuming and ship type specific Alternative Design process may exhibit an unavoidable challenge, as IMO rules are not yet in place;
Market deployment, cost reduction strategies (including maintenance for marine environments) leading to viable business models need to be developed;
The public domain needs to be addressed, ensuring the acceptance of these new propulsion systems by the shipping industry and public.

[34] https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/shipping_en
Scope:
The scope of this topic is to develop a prototype of a maritime power system operating on LH2 including bunkering concept with the potential for scaling-up (for larger amount of stored energy in adequacy with a 20 MW system, preferably fuel cell based), ensuring minimisation of hydrogen loss/leakage/boil-off. The system should be capable to deliver to the ship propulsion and/or on-board energy needs. The prototype's scalability needs to be proven ensuring the capability to completely replace prevailing ship propulsion systems.
A reference ship should be selected for the ship’s operational profile, the power/energy requirements and volume/weight constraints defined. A type of ship within an early adopters' segment of maritime transport preferably with potential for extensive use and widespread deployment is recommended, to secure the overall impact of the effort.
The proposals should address the following technical components/issues of the prototype system:
LH2 fuel supply/bunkering infrastructure;
LH2 storage and distribution in a ship, with a minimum of 1.5 tons of tank capacity;
A power system of minimum 2 MW output, preferably based on fuel cell technology; other conventional technology solutions (such as combustion engines) could be offered, but their development is not considered within the scope of the topic and therefore not supported by funding;
Evaluate the technical feasibility and the benefit of cogeneration to provide additionally heat to the ship and, if possible tri-generation including cooling;
Identify best configuration of electrical architecture for an optimal integration (e.g. AC/DC grids, power management system, batteries, etc…), allowing for hybridizing potential with different combination of fuel cells, batteries, super cap, or combustion engines if desired;
The performance, durability and efficiency of the prototype system should be demonstrated according to the operational profiles defined by the reference ship. The project should include an operational/testing period of at least 12 months (including both winter and summer season) and a minimum of 3,000 operational hours. Bunkering to sustain the normal operational profile of the system should be considered;
Scalability to suit larger 20 MW applications should be proven at design phase including definition and design of physical on-board integration and interconnection with other main ship’s systems (e.g. fuel, electric, thermal) for the 20 MW scale system with corresponding energy storage requirements.
In addition, the project should address the regulatory, economic and societal issues such as:
Address and contribute to develop regulations, codes and standards (RCS) needed for shipping application, including the safety issues related to H2 fuelling protocols/bunkering and the H2 fuel storage;
Establish/include a ship design where storage of LH2 is fully integrated into the ship, in order to pave the way for more integrated solutions and contribute to the establishment and further development of maritime rules and guidelines for selected H2 powered vessel design(s) in line with class/flag/port approval requirements;
Assess and propose suitable business models, to foster further commercialisation of technical hydrogen solutions both on board the vessel and bunkering/refuelling;
Quantify the potential for cost reductions as the hydrogen technologies mature and define the necessary roadmap;
Assess the advantages of using hydrogen systems in combination with the liquid hydrogen (LH2) in terms of emission reduction during operation, noise reduction, availability and reliability;
Discuss /share experiences with the shipping industry to contribute to raise awareness of the potential of hydrogen-based technology, and accelerate the development of LH2 for different types of ships;
Define training requirements for operator and crews.
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
The project should closely follow the developments in the IGF Code Correspondence Group at the IMO [35], works of the European Sustainable Shipping Forum (Sub-group on alternative fuels) [36] and relevant work of the certification bodies.
Finally, the following activities should be also included:
Validate in laboratory system components' performance, durability and efficiency for use profiles defined by reference ship application;
Evaluate ship’s performance through two dimensions Least Cost Path (LCP) Analysis: horizontally i.e. spanning the entire lifecycle of the ship and vertically i.e. assessing the overall impact of fuel chain (production, distribution and utilization) for prototype while the LH2 market matures;
Evaluate the economics of the proposed solution and lay out a pathway towards a positive business case through the entire value chain;
Define a go-to market strategy supported by marine industry and ships operators;
Address project’s activities complementing the projects funded under the following calls:
Horizon 2020: LC-MG-1.8-2019, “Retrofit Solutions and Next Generation Propulsion for Waterborne Transport” [37];
FCH-01-2-2019 “Scaling up and demonstration of a multi-MW Fuel Cell system for shipping” [38].
TRL at start of the project: 5 and TRL at the end of the project: 7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
“CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform39 to ensure that the hydrogen produced and used is of renewable nature.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 8 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 5 years (including 12 months of ship operation, all seasons included).

Expected Impact:
As the aim of this topic is to develop and demonstrate a prototype of a large hydrogen system capable of providing large autonomy under usual maritime operational conditions, it should prove that the developed technology is viable on-board a given vessel and that the scalability is possible for providing full propulsion and auxiliary loads for ships.
The expected impact should include:
Validating that the power system may reach a durability of 25,000 h (by applying AST protocols);
Demonstrating the relevance of LH2 as a solution to decarbonise relevant segments of the shipping sector;
Approval of specific ship type following the Alternative Design process, thereby facilitating faster deployment of more ships of same type;
Ensuring that appropriate training processes are in place to safety manage LH2 both in a port environment and on a ship;
Demonstrating an availability of 97 % for the entire prototype system during operation;
Improving environmental performance of waterborne transport towards achieving a goal of low-to-zero-emission;
Increasing EU's competitive lead in green shipping technology;
Fostering further development of regulations, codes and standards for maritime hydrogen applications;
The proposed solution, when implemented in a vessel, should be able to reduce the CO2 and NOx emissions by 90%, compared to incumbent technologies (i.e., heavy fuel oil converted in combustion engines), in a tank to wake perspective.

Achievement of the automotive cost targets for a broader market introduction. This is mainly due to carbon fiber costs, conventional manufacturing processes not developed for high productivity and architecture concepts that are not compatible with mass production. To tackle this challenge, significant advances with respect to mechanical reinforcement, architectural optimization and compressed overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) manufacturing are required.
Vessel and ancillary component (tank valve, pressure regulator) integration in the vehicle in order to ease assembling procedures and maximize customer available volume.
Hydrogen refuelling times truly comparable to those of conventional fuels require an extended temperature range of the COPV. Likewise being able to extract the maximum hydrogen mass flow independent of the state of charge (SOC) calls for the ability of the COPV and the complete fueling system to operate at lower temperatures.
Increase the acceptance of COPVs for hydrogen storage in automobile applications by means of a higher safety level. It is necessary to ensure, that COPVs can be transferred into safe mode during thermal incidents.
Scope:
Development of new and/or optimized tank geometries having the same storage performances and providing an enhanced integration in the car space at comparable price.
Define standardized interfaces and objects in order to gain from the economy of scales.
Improve filling and venting tolerance of COPV (e.g. enhanced liner materials and multi-material assembling materials and techniques to increase mechanical and temperature tolerance (e.g. real -40°C H2 filling, - 60°C cold filling, +100°C).
Development and assessment of COPV innovative and flexible manufacturing processes for very large production capacity (objective to decrease the manufacturing time by a factor of 3)
Development of a cost-reduction strategy (increased materials efficiency, weight and volume reduction, manufacturing optimization, cost-efficient storage geometries/designs)
Miniaturization and integration of tank components, e.g. on-tank valve, pressure regulator
Development and validation of numerical tools (probabilistic models) to optimize COPV performance and durability and reduce cost and manufacturing discrepancies
Provide input to revised regulation codes and standards for storage tanks for compressed hydrogen.
For the protection against the worst-case scenario of the failure of the TPRD, a leak-before-burst vessel design should be developed. In this connection the failure mechanism of the vessel has to be studied. Furthermore, systems for detecting local fires and efficient fire protection systems as additional security measures are to be evaluated.
TRL at start: 4
TRL at end: 6
The consortium should include at least one vessel supplier, one pressure component developer and an OEM. The consortium should build on experience from past projects in the field (at national or European level) in order to push the most promising materials and technologies to higher TRL/MRL.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
Coherent strategy defining the ultimate weight/cost savings achievable with conventional COPV and/or novel geometries and/or novel architecture strategies providing the best trade-off.
Development of new automated and flexible manufacturing processes, equipment and tools in coherence with mass manufacturing with a significant impact on:
COPV manufacturing yield (target: Increase productivity by a factor of 3)
Reduced performance scattering (Standard deviation of burst pressure reduced by 30%)
Improved filling/venting tolerance of storage systems (temperature range: -60°C to +100°C) to sustain fast-filling and unrestricted extraction.
Provide technical and performance validation of prototypes with respect to EU standards (e.g. EC79)
Produce whitepapers for RCS and/or maintenance guidance
Demonstrate leak-before-burst vessel designs and fire detection and protection concepts.
The following KPIs are expected to be reached at the tank system level in compliance with the MAWP:
Volumetric capacity: 0.023Kg/l (2020)
Gravimetric capacity: 5%"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European urban areas are increasingly facing deterioration of their air quality. Among other contributors, urban trucks equipped with current ICE technologies performing number of services are emitting local pollutants (CO, NO, PM, HC) which cause bad air quality.
Thus, from a healthcare perspective, local pollution in urban areas and city centers are becoming a growing concern for an increasing number people and public authorities.
With the hope to quickly improve air quality, several big European cities have already decided to limit the access to urban areas of diesel-fueled heavy duty-vehicles. Many others are considering applying the same approach.
Therefore, local authorities expect that industry makes available advanced and more sustainable solutions for urban logistics, including innovative zero emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
The first urban logistics truck prototypes powered exclusively by batteries have largely insufficient driving range. Payload penalty and charging time are also major issues, penalizing profitability for loaders and making very unlikely the commercial success of this kind of vehicles.
On the other hand, Fuel Cell technologies may dramatically improve the driving range of these vehicles providing the operational attributes necessary to replace diesel trucks.
An urban fuel cell truck should be able to accomplish the same daily mission as its diesel version (e.g. refueling time), while proposing an acceptable payload in comparison with an “all-electric” version.
Among the different possible urban truck applications, one of the most promising for the implementation and commercialization of Fuel Cell technologies, is that of garbage trucks, i.e. heavy duty trucks specially designed and used to collect municipal solid waste and haul the collected waste to a solid waste treatment facility
Scope:
The topic calls for deployment and validation of at least 10 Fuel Cell urban garbage trucks. The trucks will be operated in different European cities willing to improve their urban logistics via the utilization of innovative solutions. They should be deployed covering at least 3 sites with a minimum of 2 trucks per site. The garbage trucks should have Gross Vehicle Weight comprised between 16 and 26 tons. Said trucks should integrate a FC of at least 40 kW and be able to perform daily back-to-base missions within the urban area where they will be employed.
In the frame of the foreseen project, the garbage trucks should be manufactured, deployed and their behavioral performances should be validated by real end-users in a real operating environment.
The FC trucks object of the present call should be derived from a hybrid or electric platform to limit the risks linked to the electrification of the whole power train and the integration of the fuel cell system and can be equipped with a battery essentially aiming to manage energy braking recovery and power demand peaks.
Nevertheless, it is required that the fuel cell and hydrogen system provides at least half of the energy needed for performing its daily duty.
The trucks should be designed to meet end-users’ needs and the behavioral features of the conventional garbage trucks usually circulating in the cities hosting the project.
The cities shall ensure a high involvement in promoting these technologies, and in particular, facilitating the deployment and the exploitation of the new urban trucks.
The fuel cell trucks are expected to comply with the following requirements:
> 20,000 h vehicle operation lifetime initially, minimum 25,000 h lifetime as project target
The key power source of vehicles must be a fuel cell system or an hybrid solution with a battery and a fuel cell
Fuel cell system MTBF > 2,500 km
Availability > 90% (to be measured in available operation time)
Tank-to-wheel efficiency > 42%, for trucks measured in real cycles.
Series production ability has to be shown
It will be important to demonstrate that the fuel cell garbage trucks will be able to fulfill the typical requirements of this application, assuring one day of operation without refill.
The funding per truck should be the lesser of 1800€/kW installed FC plus 650 €/kg stored H2 or 300,000 €.
The minimum operational period for any truck demonstrated in the project is 24 months or 8000 hours of operation.
Beyond demonstration of the technology the participating cities shall ensure the communication of their efforts to other cities/regions in Europe and beyond and use appropriate channels/fora to share their experience within the project.
It would be preferable if the project is co-funded by national, regional or private sources in order to prove a strong commitment towards clean propulsion and emission free public transport. In this case, co-funding should be fully secured before the signature of the grant agreement to ensure timely realization of the project.
Proposers should provide a clear evidence of:
political support for the project together with commitment to further involvement in the roll-out must be provided as part of the proposal, through a Letter of Intent
a comprehensive exploitation-plan for the project should also form part of the proposal.
The consortium should include trucks fleet providers/operators, trucks OEMs and FC systems integrators, industrial players, local and regional bodies, as appropriate and relevant to the effective delivery of the program.
The following TRL is at least required: 6 for the FC truck at start of project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million per project. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic
Expected duration: 4-5 years
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the project provides a significant step towards successful market introduction of FC trucks by reducing their cost significantly while increasing their maturity, reliability and lifetime. It is also expected that by using FC systems (preferably already demonstrated successfully in FC passenger cars) in this road transport application, the uptake of FC technology and cost reduction of FC and FC system components is significantly increased.
Existing and/or new hydrogen refueling stations will be heavily utilized due to the large H2 consumption expected for this type of heavy-duty trucks and therefore generate a bigger learning effect in comparison to under-utilized stations for other applications. This is a precondition on the pathway towards commercial operation of refueling infrastructure. It shall increase the confidence of end-users and fleet operators in reliable fuel supply and demonstrate the viability of fuel cells for trucks.

The project should identify and disseminate:
Lessons learnt from implementing and operating urban heavy-duty trucks for early adopters
Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the impact of the technology on public health and urban living (e.g. comparison against incumbent technology, in situ measurement etc.)
Professional dissemination of information on the activities of the project to the broad public is seen as a key part of the demonstration project. It should especially be foreseen to communicate the benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells in public transport. Regional authorities should support the project with communication."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Costs associated to the hydrogen refuelling station represent a large share of the overall hydrogen costs in transport applications, with a strong impact on the business models of hydrogen mobility. Large scale refuelling (e.g. hydrogen passenger cars, busses and trucks fleets, rail transport as well as maritime applications) expected in the next years will require hydrogen refuelling stations with capacities of 1 t/day or more, at pressure levels of 350 bar or 700 bar (i.e. 450 bar or 900 bar at the station). CAPEX and OPEX (energy costs + maintenance) of the station can represent 3 €/kg H2 or more. About 50% of these costs are related to the compression, making this component a significant bottleneck for FCV deployments, as also found in fuel cell bus demonstration projects (CHIC, CUTE. HYTRANSIT…). In particular, operational expenditures are critical in the context of large-scale stations. These costs include energy, maintenance, as well as the indirect costs induced when a station is out of order.
Currently available mechanical hydrogen compressors are too costly for large-scale applications and lack the desired durability, efficiency and reliability. This results in high operational and maintenance costs. Lack of reliability of mechanical compressors is due to the large number of moving parts, the challenge of guaranteeing the tightness of high-pressure moving parts, and the lifetime of membranes (~2000 h).
Breakthrough disruptive technologies exist (including electrochemical and metal hydride compressors) and promise significant reduction of total cost of ownership of hydrogen refuelling stations because of the elimination of mechanical compressor disadvantages. However, the maturity of these technologies has to be increased with respect to capacity, durability, lifetime and reliability. None of these technologies has demonstrated until now the ability of providing sufficient flow rates for large-scale applications at reasonable costs. Previous FCH 2 JU funded projects have enabled the development of small prototypes (PHAEDRUS, COSMHYC). However, no large-scale system has been developed to date, as the focus was set on 200 kg/day stations, corresponding to the needs of the market introduction of passenger cars.
Therefore, there is a need for major improvements to meet the criteria of large refuelling stations, both at the scale of the core technology (focus on kinetics and scale effects in selected materials, impact of improved kinetics on life time and performances, architecture of core components) as well as for the system integration (design of entire system, innovative concepts adapted to larger scale, choice of adapted auxiliaries). In addition, the new technologies currently require the use of critical raw materials (such as platinum or rare earths) in most of the developed concepts.
Scope:
This topic calls for proposals to develop and test at pilot scale an innovative compressor concept for hydrogen refuelling stations that is able to provide large flow rates (50 kg/h or more) at affordable costs and is well adapted for at least one representative transport application (350 bar or 700 bar). The compression concept should include either one of the disruptive technology (e.g. electrochemical or metal hydrides; any other disruptive technologies can be eligible if an appropriate argumentation is provided) or a combination of hybridised compression technologies, including at least one disruptive technology.

Hydrogen should contribute to the integration of renewable energies into the European energy mix. Therefore, the compression concept should be able to use hydrogen from different sources (onsite electrolysis, biogas reforming, hydrogen bottles and pipeline). Consequently, the allowable inlet pressure should be low (preferably in the range of 20 bar, or lower).
The project should contribute to increase the maturity level of at least one disruptive compression technology. In particular, it should enable to:
decrease the degradation of the technology down to at least the same level as mechanical compressors;
reduce the use of critical raw materials;
demonstrate an improvement of the reliability and availability of the HRS;
decrease the total costs of ownership of the HRS;
improve the efficiency of the hydrogen value chain by decreasing the electricity consumption.
Proposals should plan to assess the overall economic feasibility of the proposed compression concept, addressing operational and installation cost of the system, benchmarking with current HRS systems and including potential impacts on the rest of the station (storage, cooling etc.). The total cost of ownership (TCO) of the compression concept should be calculated, as well as the economic impact of the concept on the overall costs of the hydrogen refuelling station.
In the case of a hybridised system, the project should include modelling of the hybridised compression system in order to demonstrate that the proposed solution represents a techno-economic optimum.
The project should include demonstration of the performance of the compression concept by long term tests (a period of at least 6 months) in a relevant environment, for example a hydrogen refuelling station without public access or an outdoor test facility, at minimum 1/10 of real scale.
TRL start: 3 and TRL end: 5.
The consortium should include component suppliers, component testing entities, hydrogen system integrators or operators. The project should build on the activities and results reached in previous or existing FCH 2 JU projects, such as PHAEDRUS, COSMHYC or H2REF.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2.75 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
The following KPIs should be reached:
Development of a compression concept from low pressure (in the range of 20 bar or less) to 450 bar or 900 bar (deviations are acceptable if justified by the proposed concept), being able to use hydrogen from different sources (onsite electrolysis, biogas reforming, hydrogen bottles and pipeline) and to reach flow rates of at least 4 kg/h and show scalability in order to reach 80 kg/h or more (corresponding to 2t/day or more) on the mid-term. The concept should take into account the change of scale compared to small compressors in the early design phase;
Demonstrate perspective for overall investment costs reduced down to < €2000/kg H2/day, reaching < €1000/kg H2/day on the long term for a system of 1t/day or more. Demonstrate the potential for low electricity consumption for large installations (< 4 kWh/kg for a suction pressure similar to current HRS and < 8 kWh/kg for a very low suction pressure, i.e. < 5 bar);
Demonstrate maintenance costs of less than 5% of the investment costs per year;
Demonstrate availability of more than 95%;
If the technologies implemented induce the use of critical raw materials, demonstrate significant improvements in reducing or even avoiding the use of these critical raw materials (including platinum and rare earths, as defined in the MAWP of the FCH 2 JU); Critical raw materials should represent no more than 10% of the total investment costs of the compressor;
Demonstrate less than 1% performance decay in 1000 hours of operation;
This topic will contribute to meeting the techno-economic objectives 3 and 5 of the MAWP, by reducing the dependency from critical raw materials as well as the operating and capital costs of the hydrogen infrastructure.
In addition, the project should:
Provide recommendations supporting further technology developments, enabling future large scale production of low-costs compression systems for large flow rates;
Demonstrate that innovative compression concept does not introduce additional contaminants in the hydrogen so that ISO 14687:2-2012 quality can be fulfilled.

High temperature electrolysers (HTE) can potentially replace fossil energy input with renewable electricity for the generation of hydrogen, for example in refineries and chemical industry, whereby available waste heat from the plant improves the efficiency of the electrolysis process.
This topic is aimed at a step change improvement in high temperature electrolyser technology to enable future commercial introduction.
This improvement can be on the level of the cell, stack or system layout. To develop a wider market, medium term targets for this technology are in relationship with step change and improvement in performances of the technology, trying to overcome some of the actual limiting factors and / or introducing novelties in the cell, stack and system layout able to catch better performances (e.g. current densities, cells and stacks dimensions, stack pressurization).
The improved high temperature electrolyser technology must be tested in a relevant environment.
In agreement to the MAWP, targets related to efficiency, OPEX, pressure, lifetime and cost of hydrogen need to be addressed and fulfilled by the high temperature steam electrolysers covered by that topic.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on the development, and testing in a relevant environment, of a low-cost, high-temperature electrolyser system, targeting the following improvements which are in line with the MAWP targets, without compromising the other targets included in the MAWP:
Larger cells and stacks compared with the state of the art, for both atmospheric or pressurized operation: for atmospheric operation a value of at least 50 kW (electrical) per stack is targeted; for pressurized operation, a value of 10 kW (electrical) per stack is targeted;
Improve total electrical efficiency to above 75% based on higher heating value, in agreement with the MAWP KPI (> 2023 value);
Cost reduction through use of standard industry components (power electronics, heat exchangers,..), to decrease the cost of the hydrogen produced below 6.9 €/kg, in agreement with the MAWP KPI (2020 value);
All these improvements being done in conjunction with extended dynamic operation without decreasing the durability.
In addition, the proposal should address at least one of the following optional targets:
higher flexibility in start / stop, increasing 10 times the SoA performances;
high pressure electrolysis with hydrogen output pressure of at least 30 bars;
other step-change improvement in high temperature electrolysis.
The expected electrolysis system, including stack, balance of plant and power electronics, should be developed at a relevant scale. If an atmospheric system is considered, a minimum value of 50 kW electrical is considered, while it should exceed 10 kW in the case of a pressurized system.
Projects should feature:
Integration of the targeted improvement in a complete electrolyser system;
Coupling, including thermal management, of the system with a (waste) heat source;
Demonstration of the system in a relevant environment for at least 2000 hours.

a techno-economic analysis of the technology, including projected hydrogen production cost as function of relevant parameters (electricity price, capital cost, stack lifetime, utilisation);
a life-cycle analysis including CO2 footprint in using the electrolyser;
recommendations for further development needs for commercialisation.
Testing should be done in accordance to the FCH JU harmonised testing procedures developed by the JRC in collaboration with European industry and researchers.
It is expected that the technology starts at TRL 3 and reaches TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The consortium should include at least one SOEC stack/module manufacturer, research institutions and academic groups.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
More than 90% of total hydrogen demand comes from large industrial applications, e.g. chemical, refinery and metal works. Today, the vast majority of this hydrogen is produced centrally from natural gas using steam reformers at very low costs (<3 €/kg). Steam reformers typically have capacities of up to 10,000 kg/h hydrogen production and emit 8-11 kg CO2 per 1 kg of hydrogen. Large-scale, efficient electrolysis technologies to produce green hydrogen from renewable electricity could significantly reduce those emissions, if costs can be reduced.
High temperature steam electrolysis (SOEC) has the potential to decrease green hydrogen costs to a level close to fossil hydrogen, as it can use low-cost waste heat or steam at low temperatures (< 200°C) from industrial process to reduce the electrical energy requirement. With availability of steam the electricity consumption can be reduced to <40 kWh/kg. This promises a significant reduction of hydrogen costs for industrial applications.
With support from FCH 2 JU, steam electrolysis has reached TRL 4-5. The challenge is now to scale-up the technology to a level relevant for industrial customers, bring the steam electrolysis closer to the TRL of PEM and alkaline electrolysers and show a perspective for the reduction of hydrogen costs close to steam reformer level.
Furthermore, the proof of the high efficiency, degradation rates and stack lifetime requires long-term testing under industrial conditions. This is key for achieving competitive hydrogen costs in industrial applications, as well as the reduction of CAPEX of steam electrolysers from today’s 10-12 M€/(t/d) to below 3 M€/(t/d). The reduction of CAPEX requires large-scale application and an increase in production volumes.
A scale-up to ‘megawatt class’ is considered an important milestone in system development in the electrolysis industry, when targeting large scale applications. At this scale, specific costs of balance of plant components become more competitive and industrial, more affordable components can be used in the electrolysis systems.
Scope:
This topic calls for a large-scale steam electrolyser with an output of at least 15 kg/h to be demonstrated in a relevant industrial environment (iron and steel works, refinery, or industry with excess heat / steam that uses H2). The system must use renewable electricity either through direct connection to a renewable power source or through a contractual relationship with a renewable power source (e.g. via a power purchase agreement). In the latter case, the procedure and pitfalls as well as learnings and best practices should be reported. The electrolyser system needs to be equipped with all necessary ancillary equipment for steam and electricity supply as well as hydrogen processing to meet the customer’s expectations in terms of purity, volume and pressure.
The electrolyser should operate for at least two years, whereas a scheduled stack replacement is not foreseen within this time period.
The demonstration should validate prospects for the business case for industry-scale steam electrolysis. The valorisation of any side product (e.g. oxygen) within the industrial environment should be investigated aiming to improve the business case.
The project should aim to the following:
Development of an improved steam electrolyser system of at least 15 kg/h hydrogen production capacity and demonstration in an industrially relevant environment to benchmark the requirements from the industrial hydrogen consumer against the capability of fossil-based systems. The evaluation will consider innovative business models that could motivate industrial consumers to switch from fossil-based systems to renewable ones;
A cumulated production of at least 50 tons of renewable hydrogen;
Specific electricity consumption (beginning-of-life): < 40 kWhel/kg (<3.6 kWhel/Nm³) @ rated power based on external steam supply and without compression; the steam must be provided by the industrial source directly or created from waste heat. The electrical production of steam for the electrolysis is not eligible within this project;
Demonstrate the hot start from min to max power in less than 5 mins, to provide secondary grid balancing services, as well as the capability of steam electrolysers to follow the fluctuations of renewable power production;
Average specific electricity consumption (over the project period) should be documented;
Demonstrate the production of renewable hydrogen, based on the definition of the CertifHy project [19];
Maintenance and repair costs will be reported and compared to a target of 225 €/(kg/d)/year by 2020, as well as the CAPEX target of 4,500 €/(kg/d) by 2020 and recommendations to meet this target will be given;
Perform a techno-economic analysis that proves the feasibility of the business case over the lifetime of the system. This analysis should also incorporate the expected operational behaviour of the system during lifetime due to stack degradation;
The grid connection costs, electrolyser costs and the electricity costs for the commissioning phase are eligible for funding. Electricity costs during demonstration / business operation are not eligible and should be covered through the sale of hydrogen.
The proposals should provide the evidence that a suitable electrolysis system can be made available for the project.
The consortium should include at least the electrolyser developer and an industrial hydrogen consumer, who can substitute a substantial amount of its present fossil hydrogen demand with hydrogen production out of steam electrolysis.

Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy intensive industries (EII) including food, pulp and paper, basic chemicals, refining, iron and steel, nonferrous metals (primarily aluminum), and nonmetallic minerals (primarily cement) consume around one quarter of the energy in Europe and are a large contributor to GHG emissions. The majority of the energy currently comes from hydrocarbons such as coal, natural gas and oil.
Hydrogen is often the only solution to substitute carbon-based reducing agents, gases, and fuels that brings significant GHG emission reductions, especially if the hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources. The reason why renewable hydrogen has not yet been rolled-out at a significant scale in EII is due to the high production costs of hydrogen, as well as a slow adaptation rate to emerging technologies in EII such as electrolysis.
The high-temperature electrolyser (HTE) technology is well suited for EII as the availability of low-grade heat sources helps to improve the process efficiency and hence the production costs compared to low-temperature electrolysers (PEM, AEL). The project aims to scale HTE to a level that starts to have recognition in EII while simultaneously presenting the world’s largest HTE. Current HTE technologies have not yet demonstrated the MAWP 2020 targets for efficiency, durability and costs at (i) megawatt scale and (ii) over a relevant period of time. In order to show that these targets can be met in short-term and to increase industrial awareness and confidence, at least 24-month demonstration at an industrial site is needed. Significant efficiency gains should be achieved by fully integrating the HTE into the specific EII processes.
As durability is one of key hurdles to market penetration, it is important and urgent to address degradation effects and robustness of auxiliary equipment such as steam supplies or hydrogen compression and purification. Here, former system projects have shown that combining HTE with compression and hydrogen purification is a special challenge.
Only few HTE stack technologies have been demonstrated on an intermediate scale so far to offer a fast path to scale-up based on full system experience. To ensure the longer-term take-up of the most efficient stack technology, at least 2 different stacks are to be physically benchmarked in a relevant system environment (hotbox test) at 10 kWSOE level and economically evaluated within the project in order to identify the available stack options for further upscaling.
Scope:
This topic calls for a large-scale multi-megawatt high-temperature electrolyser to be demonstrated in EII under realistic market conditions by using renewable electricity. Steam should be provided, at least partially, from an external source (e.g. from waste heat) in order to illustrate the superior efficiencies of HTE compared to low-temperature electrolyser systems.
The demonstration should prove an economical business case for HTE by generating hydrogen at competitive prices. Prospects for the business case should be solid and well justified. The valorization of any side product (e.g. oxygen or power management) within the industrial environment should be considered too.
It is expected that the project would:
Address a particular EII and propose the integration of an HTE. The HTE should be benchmarked against alternative solutions and the advantages of the selected process route for further development under the proposed project should be explained;
Manufacture, integrate and operate an HTE at the level of a large pilot (>60 kg/h hydrogen) over a period of at least 36 months;
Provide a benchmark stack test of at least 10 kWel with at least 2 different stack technologies;
Perform long term operation under realistic operation including cycles for at least 16,000 h (long-term testing);
Provide information on integrated process efficiency, electricity and steam consumption, and hydrogen consumption;
Evaluate the expected environmental performance – at the very least GHG emissions reduction potential (at the level of the full process route, including production of hydrogen),
Minimize the use of any critical raw materials and other major environmental burdens;

Special importance should be given to degradation effects resulting from contaminations either from steam supplies or from the materials that are used inside the system; efficiency degradation rates lower than 0.5%/1000 h at constant hydrogen should be achieved.
The system should consist of a number of HTE modules to enable larger flexibility in operation. Industrial applications typically require different hydrogen qualities up to 5.0 as large differences exist and need to be investigated individually for every application. The project should address whether a pre-treatment of e.g. water/steam, constructional changes in the electrolyser or an after-treatment of hydrogen is the most economical solution in terms of CAPEX, OPEX and achievable hydrogen quality. Furthermore, the project should prove high availability, low maintenance requirements and high efficiency of compression and hydrogen purification systems in combination with rigid requirements of HTE systems in terms of pressure and load fluctuations.
The project should propose future strategies to tackle the issue of constant hydrogen demand of the EII processes and the intermittent availability of renewable energies for the production of renewable hydrogen (e.g. through hybrid power purchasing models, polygeneration or small Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) with renewable gas, large scale hydrogen storage). Therefore, “CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be issued through the CertifHy platform to ensure that the hydrogen production is of renewable nature.
A higher thermal and chemical integration of the electrolyser into downstream processes can increase overall efficiency and complexity. Likewise, the utilization of the oxygen produced via HTE has an impact on overall efficiency. Any other auxiliary systems necessary for the specific EII process should be assessed for trade-offs in terms of added value gained against CAPEX and OPEX expenditures to ensure optimal integration of the HTE modules in the plant.
TRL at start: 7 and TRL at end: 8.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 7 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 4 - 5 years.
Expected Impact:
One of the main impact would be building of the world’s largest HTE in EU and demonstration thereby of its both technological and industrial leadership in SOC technology. The demonstration of an HTE as a chemical energy supply for energy intensive industry processes significantly lower the carbon footprint in a specific showcase, integrated in an industrial environment, using renewable electricity. Thanks to the superior efficiencies of HTE, with electricity consumptions of ≤ 40 kWh/kg H2 if operated with steam from exhaust heat, competitive hydrogen prices can be achieved in many industries.
A successful validation of HTE module(s) on multi-megawatt scale and achievement of the KPIs listed below will increase maturity and credibility of the technology. The direct comparative benchmarking of various stacks will favor the emergence of a more specialized/structured supply chain, offering system integrators qualified options for system developments in their specific context.
The project should also reduce the gap between HTE and low-temperature electrolysis such as PEMEL and AEL. The stack benchmarking should also identify the available stack options for further scaling and prepare the path for large cost reductions due to increased production volumes.
A technology comparison will improve the credibility and competitiveness of multiple players in this field. Together with very large potential market, a successful product launch will strengthen the EU industry’s position globally and creates prospects for future jobs.
The target KPIs according to MAWP 2024 (Annex 2) have to be met on the electrolyser system level:
Electricity consumption @nominal capacity: ≤ 39 kWh / kg (of hydrogen)
Availability: ≥ 98 %
Capital Cost: ≤ 2,400 € / (kg/d)
Stack production loss rate: ≤ 1.2 %/1,000 h
Operations & Maintenance cost ≤ 120 €/(kg/d)/year
The project should present a commercially acceptable service and maintenance concept that shows that O&M cost of ≤ 120 €/(kg/d)/year can be achieved.

The direct conversion of solar energy to hydrogen remains a fundamental goal for the forthcoming energy economy based on renewable sources. It is therefore important to develop new and less expensive technologies for obtaining hydrogen by water photo splitting using sunlight. These aims are fully based on the recommendations from the ongoing Green Hydrogen Study.
To bring photo-electrolysis to a commercially viable level, main efforts have so far been focused on the development of new photo-catalytic materials with high efficiencies at lower costs. Systems with relatively high efficiency are usually composed by expensive and often chemically unstable materials, while other less sophisticated systems do not yet have satisfactory yields. While benchmark materials have been established over the past few years, none of the materials is close to being optimised yet. In fact, a basic problem remains to be solved which is the development of both novel semiconductors with superior electronic properties and optimal potentials, additionally showing a high capability of absorbing the visible components of sunlight.
In order to further advance the technology towards the market, the materials research must be accompanied by development of reliable and highly flexible photo-electrolysis devices that operate at high solar-to-hydrogen-efficiencies and exhibit lower production costs. Advanced device engineering is required to maximise electrode performance, optimise the mass and current transfer characteristics, and prevent corrosion and photo-corrosion. An operative prototype with significant hydrogen production, able to consider the effect of variable solar illumination, has not been developed yet.
Scope:
Aim of the project is the development of full technology (i.e. materials selection, prototype development, techno-economical evaluation) for direct water splitting from sunlight, followed by a demonstration of up scaling and the set-up of a prototype production equipment. A photo-electrochemical approach, employing either single-photo-electrode cells or tandem cells should be followed for this purpose. A pure photocatalytic approach cannot be excluded a-priori, but it should be clearly demonstrated to be applicable for the developed system.
Goals should be obtained considering a wide variety of solids, with particular attention to cheap and chemically robust systems (e.g. metal oxides, nitrides, Si-based materials). A preliminary screening using both theoretical (band gap and band energies calculations) and experimental tools (photosensitivity, charge separation capability) is required in order to identify suitable system to be tested in a true photocatalytic apparatus.
Proposals should also aim at the development of an innovative device that is able to overcome the limitations occurring in current state-of-the-art technologies. The new cell concept should be development based on optimized photo-catalysts to be suited for large-scale production processes, as demonstrated by a prototype system.
The proposals should put their main emphasis on following topics:
selection of materials with optimised photocatalytic properties
proof-of-concept for a new photo-electrolysis device concept for decentralised hydrogen production
demonstration of solar-to-hydrogen reliable and efficient conversion at demonstrator scale
investment cost for the new technology estimated by a socio-techno-economical assessment
Projects are expected to start at TRL 3 and to reach at least TRL 5.
Proposals should build upon experience and results from previously funded projects both on national and European level on component and system development.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 4 years
A maximum of 1 project will be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
A real proof of concept and not a simple benchmarking is mandatory as a result of the project.
Expected outcomes from the project are the following:
Full analysis (e.g. definition of materials, project of the system, BoP, effect of a variable solar irradiation, thermal management) of photocatalytic systems for direct hydrogen production from sunlight
A prototype system with an exposed surface higher than 10 m2 has to be developed with selected material, including full gas control (i.e. hydrogen and oxygen collection, purification, online analysis, storage, etc.) Optimized management of the prototype should be demonstrated
Specific targets to be obtained by the prototype system are the following:
H2 production demonstrated > 15 g/h or 10 KgH2 over the complete running time
Efficiency > 5 %
Running time > 6 months with a degradation lower than 10% under harsh operating conditions
H2 cost < 5 €/kg H2
The materials selected and most promising should be upscaled and proved through in-field testing
A cost analysis of the developed technology must be performed"

Isolated areas in Europe (e.g. villages, alpine refuges or 1000s of islands) have high electricity generation cost, due to the special challenges posed by the remoteness in terms of difficult access, harsh climate, low population density. The production of electricity in these areas generally derives from combustion plants powered by fossil fuels and the cost of electrical energy in these areas is heavily dependent on the high cost of these fossil fuels (i.e. the installation cost, the service logistics and the fuel transport) due to the remote location.
Today, numerous islands have significant renewable energy capacity or plan to invest in this sector. However, most of these isolated energy systems have not yet been able to guarantee their independence from fossil fuels. This is mainly because of the renewables intermittency and the lack of long term (weeks, months) energy storage solutions for these remote locations.
The specific challenge of the topic is to demonstrate in isolated micro-grids and/or off grid sites the implementation of reliable and clean integrated power solution based on electrolyser and fuel cell technology to secure cost-effective power supply, with the following site characteristics:
Accessibility for installation, service and maintenance is complex and expensive (transport and time);
Current power supply is not reliable (many power outages);
Import of fuel is expensive resulting in high electricity price (at least 0.25 Euro/kWh);
Use of fossil fuel and CO2 emissions are high;
Local commitment to go for 100% renewables energy system;
Storage of local energy sources is not in place today.
Scope:
The goal of this topic is to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of fuel cell technologies generating electrical energy in off-grid or isolated micro-grid areas, as stand-alone solution integrated with electrolyser and renewables.
Fuel cell technologies in the power range of 5-200 kW will be demonstrated in at least 2 sites as stand-alone and back-up power supply of technical installations (i.e. telecommunications equipment or similar) OR as end user power supply in off-grid or micro-grid remote areas. A minimum of 250 kW total power production (fuel cell) will be demonstrated. This will allow addressing different load requirement of isolated sites (e.g. remote businesses or housing/schools).
Existing sources of renewable energy will be used. Demonstration of electrolyser, storage equipment and fuel cell system is in the scope of the project. The size of the electrolyser will be defined according to the specific site requirements (i.e. type and size of the local renewable source, and especially time profile of the renewable along the day/week).
The project should:
Validate real demonstration units in representative applications of isolated micro-grid or off-grid areas, in order to enable suppliers, end users and general stakeholders to gain experience throughout the value chain; and
Demonstrate the added value of hydrogen based power-to-power energy storage solutions with respect to alternative technologies in terms of economics, technical capabilities and environmental benefits.
Demonstrate a successful operation for a cumulated duration of at least 2 years
Further objectives:
Demonstration through field applications of the advantages of innovative technologies (hardware or software) including, but not limited to, monitoring, control, diagnostics, lifetime estimation, new BoP components;
Demonstration of cost efficient solutions to the remote area, service and maintenance challenges;
Online monitoring of operating conditions, load demands and system output will provide initial data to determine the overall efficiency of the system within the testing period;
Optimization of power electronics to guarantee a proper integration of electrolyser and fuel cell products with the renewable source and end user/microgrid.
The project will be open to all fuel cell technologies.
Field demonstration usage data, efficiency, reliability are to be reported.
The proposals should represent a step forward former micro-grid and off-grid project results.
The consortium will include EU electrolyser and fuel cell system manufacturers, relevant suppliers for Balance-of-Plant components and research institutions or academic groups.
International collaboration in this field is highly encouraged, especially with IPHE members.

Expected Impact:
Following the topic from AWP2015 related to the development of electrolysers for hydrogen production in off-grid applications, this topic will focus on demonstration of integrated fuel cell-based energy solutions in off-grid remote areas or isolated micro-grid.
This demonstration must not only raise public awareness; it should be used to establish confidence in technology, business models and market readiness with end-users and authorities of isolated territories.
The project should focus on the following impacts:
Energy independency at the local scale, with maximum recovery of locally available RES;
Reduction of the cost of energy to the final users;
Reduction of use of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions;
Reduce CAPEX in line with KPIs at 2020 of the MAWP: 3M€/(t/d) for electrolysers and 4,500€/kW for fuel cell systems. Proposals able to achieve improvements on the MAWP targets will be given preference.
Increase system lifetime to more than 15 years.
Demonstrate a viable solution and a replicable business case.
Improvement of energy supply security and reliability.
Supplier and user experience of installation/commissioning, operation, maintenance and use of fuel cell power generation.
To enable generalization of the field experience obtained, benefit from experience worldwide and facilitate technology replication, it is desirable that the selected project could feed into relevant ongoing standardization activities on fuel cells during the project.

There is a need to increase the share of renewable resources in final energy consumption and achieve increases in energy efficiency. In the objectives and vision of the FCH-JU, hydrogen production from low carbon sources represents a valuable possibility to promote the decarbonisation of the energy system in a sustainable way. Thus, there is a need to in the near term identify pathways leading to low-cost hydrogen production technologies with near-zero net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from highly efficient and diverse renewable sources.
The distributed production of hydrogen (d/dt H2<500 Nm3/h) is one of the interesting approaches to introduce hydrogen as an energy carrier in the near term. This approach requires less capital investment for the smaller capacity of hydrogen, and it does not require a substantial hydrogen transport and delivery infrastructure. Such hydrogen production will use locally available feedstock and power in compact systems.
The specific challenge is to demonstrate the potentials of alternative and sustainable utilization of biogas, bio-alcohols and other biofuels as renewable fuels for a decentralized bio-hydrogen production in the form of more compact and efficient reforming technologies.
The objective of generating renewable hydrogen from biofuels is proving different possible options for the fuel cell industry, especially for application in the distributed energy market. There is a need to have many energy sources as possible to feed different types of FC (especially SOFC, MCFC, HTPEM) with renewable hydrogen to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and to improve the air quality (through the production of clean energy) in different parts of a country (cities, farms, industry, remote areas, etc..) with availability of biofuels.. In addition, the development of small-scale units, easily integrable with FCs, can help to revitalize the clean energy market that is of interest, i.e. for energy providers, companies that deal with materials (catalysts, components), software and hardware (control and monitoring systems).
Scope:
This topic calls for proposals to develop compact reformers that can be applied cost-effectively at small scale in the distributed production of hydrogen from biofuels. In general, the efficiency, the start-up time and the durability should be improved as well as the thermal management and the reduction of the thermal mass of the reformer. Moreover, the use of less pure renewable feedstock (e.g. clean biogas containing CO2 and or other pollutants and contaminants) directly in the reformers is a technological aspect that can be considered to indirectly reduce the feedstock purification cost and consequently the H2 production cost.
The reformer technology should address the following aspects:
range: 100 – 500 kg/day H2, for distributed applications in farms, municipalities, small power houses
hydrogen purity: 99,9%
demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of small units (100-500 kg /day H2) able to process renewable raw materials derived from biomass feedstock
improve the efficiency of hydrogen production through a better heat integration of the different reformers components; flexibility to process less clean biofuels
In addition, projects should support development of optimized and more compact systems, tolerant to variable amount and typology of raw materials. Thus, the proposals should demonstrate a high degree of process/reactor improvement to decrease the total required systems volume, increasing bio-fuels conversion and hydrogen yields, moreover, achieving higher overall energy efficiencies, as well as overcome heat and mass transfer limitations to increase the H2 production rate.
The project should demonstrate the economic feasibility of producing hydrogen to support integration of renewable biomass energy sources into the energy systems at distributed level.
The following objectives should be addressed:
Design and construction of bio-fuels reforming units, including BoP for thermal, gas and electrical management, demonstrating the following:
Min - max H2 production capacity: 100 - 500 kg/ day
H2 quality : 99.9%
Load variation : 20-100%
Min cold starts: 50 / year
Cold start up time: < 2 h
Start up after stand by : 15 min – immediately
Reactor & system modularity
System size and weight: Process intensification by integration of reformer catalysts and heat exchangers and burner
Control hardware, protocol/algorithms improvements for stand-alone operation
Assessment of the techno-economic performance in comparison to other state-of–the-art technologies
Demonstration of a business plan and service strategy during the project that will be replicable and validated in the chosen market segment after the project
Projects are expected to start at TRL 3 and to reach TRL 5.
Proposals should indicate the specific business case and development steps planning to reach higher TRLs > 6.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 4 years
A maximum of 1 project will be funded under this topic.

Expected outcomes from the project are to develop reactor and system design for renewable H2 produced on-site with the following features:
Total cost of H2 (including CAPEX, OPEX) between 0.3-0.5 €/Nm3

For hydrogen energy technologies to be able to compete in the energy storage market, the power-to-power round trip efficiency must be improved reducing at the same time costs.. Using two separate devices, namely an electrolyser and a fuel cell means both will be used part time, which increases the investment cost. Solid Oxide Cells (SOC) are intrinsically reversible and thus can be operated either in electrolysis mode to produce hydrogen from steam, or in fuel cell mode to produce electricity, depending on the needs. Thus, only one device is required, which is operated almost full time with fewer start/stops. In addition, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) and Solid Oxide Electrolysers (SOE) can achieve higher efficiencies while in SOFC mode electricity can be produced from H2 and/or CH4 using the same device, offering an additional flexibility.
The ability of reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC) devices to perform real dynamic cycling between power storage and power generation modes (SOE to SOFC and back) while keeping an acceptable degradation is still to be demonstrated though. Improvements to cell materials and construction are required as well as enhancements to system level issues of steam supply management, gas composition change during inversion from one mode to the other, thermal management, etc. The extensive cycling requirements to create a commercial rSOC system that can be coupled to renewable energy production systems such as wind and solar power has not been addressed to date.
Scope:
This project will focus on enabling more widespread integration of renewables through the use of r-SOC technology. Two business cases can be particularly addressed:
first, the renewable energies storage in off-grid remote areas, or in non- or low-interconnected islands, where there can already be an early market driven by emerging renewables curtailment and very high fossil generation costs [1];
second, eco-building or eco-districts, where renewable energies like PV are installed where energy storage is required to achieve consistently high penetration rates of PV production and increase profitability of PV investment while minimizing the amount of power purchased from the grid: this market has a short term, economically viable use. For residential houses, storage can allow increasing the consumption of local electricity generation from the 20-40% “natural” self-consumption to values above 50% [2], and either hydrogen or solid state battery storage or a combination of both is the most suitable option [3]. For commercial buildings where consumption profiles can be very different over a week (e.g. week-end with less or no consumption and potentially high production), the need of storage is even more evident in order not to curtail the PV production, and hydrogen-based P2P system can avoid the installation of MW-size battery systems. In addition, H2 produced can be used as fuel for vehicles if needs exist, and in case of H2 shortage, rSOC operating in fuel cell mode can be fueled with natural gas, thus offering flexibility and convergence of multiple usages.
For both cases, the rSOC technology, which allows a higher power-to-power efficiency and a maximized utilization rate, is beneficial for OPEX and CAPEX respectively. The development of these market segments will allow creating technological learning so that the larger energy storage market could be also assessed in the near future with such systems. In the project, one of those business cases, or any other documented business case will be targeted.
The following specific issues should be addressed:
Component development and system design for dynamic and reversible operation (e.g. high efficiency both in fuel cell and electrolysis mode, gas tightness, high durability in long term operation);
System operation strategies to manage switches from SOFC to SOEC operation mode: these should be aligned with ongoing normative and standardisation activities;
Reversible operation with both H2 and CH4 (SOFC) and steam (SOEC);
Optimise fuel utilisation and steam conversion rates to 80-85 % in both SOFC and SOEC mode on system level;
Develop a smart concept for electrical connection to decrease cost for power electronics;
Power modulation 50 - 100 % in fuel cell mode, H2 production rate modulation 70 – 100 % in electrolysis mode;
Minimise thermal losses and optimise thermal integration for maximum efficiency;
Demonstrate at system level a power of 50 kW (electrical) in electrolysis mode, and up to 20 kW (electrical) in fuel cell mode;

Expected Impact:
The project should show a functional rSOC system operating in both modes allowing a proper validation of the performance characteristics (efficiency, modulation, operation dynamics) for future application scenarios. The following KPIs are expected to be reached at system level:
200 full cycles from SOFC to SOEC and back during operation with minimum degradation (<2%/1,000 h);
Overall electrical energy efficiency target in electrolysis mode on steam ³75% (HHV), which is aligned with MAWP KPI (value for 2023);
Overall electrical energy efficiency target in fuel cell mode on methane ³ 55% (LHV), which is aligned with MAWP KPI (value for 2020 and 2023);
System operation time of >7,000 h;
Fuel utilisation and steam conversion rate of >80 % on large stack module level;
rSOC system CAPEX < 3.6 M€/(t/d) (electrical input in electrolysis mode), in a series production of 1,000 units/year. While no CAPEX target is set for high temperature electrolysis in the MAWP, the above values, by comparison to the KPI 2 for alkaline and PEM water electrolysis, is close to the 2018 value. For fuel cell mode it corresponds to a value of 3750 €/kW (electrical output), which is aligned with MAWP 2023 KPI for commercial mid-size fuel cells."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Increasing penetration of intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) on the grid requires large energy storage capacity. According to the analysis of CertifHy [51], EU´s demand for hydrogen in 2030 will reach 10 million tonnes, of which 17.3 % should be produced by renewable sources to fulfil the goals for the energy transition. A large share of this green hydrogen will be produced by electrolysis in areas of low electricity prices associated to renewable power from photovoltaic or wind. High-temperature steam electrolysis exhibits the highest electrical efficiency among existing water electrolysis technologies for hydrogen production with the potential of further enhancing efficiency when high-temperature heat is used for supplying steam. Therefore, it has also the potential for producing renewable hydrogen very cost –efficiently.
Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) technology has already been developed to TRL 7 including the coupling with industrial waste heat. Most of the applications rely on steady state operation of the SOE process. However, in the cases where the electrolyser is placed in the area of inexpensive electricity generation, e.g. by photovoltaics, such heat is not available all the time or not available at all. The obvious conclusion is to consider renewable heat since concentrated solar power systems are available at medium – big scales, economic and efficient in areas where photovoltaic electricity is inexpensive.
The challenge is to leverage the SOE´s efficiency by integrating renewable heat to produce renewable hydrogen with the highest efficiency among all water electrolysis technologies. As a result, renewable hydrogen will be efficiently produced in large amounts at places where both solar heat and renewable power are available. A specific challenge is given by the need of optimising the coupling of high-temperature steam electrolysis with two intermittent sources: renewable electricity and high temperature solar heat.
Dedicated solar steam generators with steam storage and handling are necessary to buffer the intermittent nature of solar heat and avoid thermal cycling of the SOE in variable operation. Furthermore, an optimized heat integrated system concept is necessary. Still due to the dynamic operation during start up and shut down cycles, steam temperatures will vary. This will demand for a SOE core technology robust enough to cope with temperature transients and gradients. This requires detailed investigation of operational models optimized for such a combination. The focus is on performance and durability of SOE in a relevant testing environment, given the fluctuations of renewable energy sources. The challenge includes understanding how fluctuating operating conditions affect the SOE core, the identification of operational strategies that are safe for the SOE, and which implications are expected on system efficiency and economics considering the production of hydrogen.

Scope:
SOE technology on cell, stack and system levels has been developed in various FCH 2 JU projects such as SOPHIA, Eco, SelySos and HELMETH52. Additionally, scale-up of high temperature electrolysers into the MW industrial-scale with integration of the waste heat in the process has already started (projects GrinHy and GrinHy 2.0).
Thermal integration of heat into SOE by using solar heat from Concentrated Solar Plants (CSP) or from power-to-heat (PtH) systems has only been a subject in the project SOPHIA so far. It was demonstrated that coupling of a SOE with CSP power plant can reduce the electricity demand of the SOE from the grid to less than 5% of the annual operating time, and can achieve a higher energetic efficiency and sustainability index compared to a photovoltaic system.
In a wider context, the project should couple high-temperature electrolysis with solar heat or power-to-heat sources at different levels from stack box to multi-kW scale and larger system level to investigate operational behaviour in detail. This should result in the identification and provision of practical technical solutions resulting from the specific operating conditions given by the coupling with intermittent RES for electric power and heat.
The project should cover the following topics:
Build-up of a stack box and a system with power capacity higher than 20kWel, including a SOE system, a solar steam source, or other renewable heat sources;
Investigation of the dynamics of the heat and electricity supply and the reactions of the SOE, under typical cycling conditions (e.g. day-night). System design should focus on solutions to maintain the SOE core warm during night. The sensitivity of SOE towards steam temperature variations caused by solar radiation volatility and / or upon dynamic operation should be investigated. A strategy should be formulated for buffering the fluctuation of heat and electricity and safe operation regimes for the SOE core also by modifying SOE stack and/or module design;
The specific operating conditions for the proposed solution should be specified (e.g. steam temperature) and determined versus the specific technology scale (e.g. number of stacks) clarifying the upscaling potential and conditions;
Perform a concept design study for a heat Integrated SOE system scale-up towards units of 100 MWel with heat supply from a large-scale renewable heat source such as a CSP plant and electricity from renewables.
TRL at start of the project: 3 and TRL at the end of the project: 5.

Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell or electrolyser components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 4 years
Expected Impact:
Integration of renewable heat will lower the cost of hydrogen produced by high-temperature solid oxide electrolysers at places without cheap steam sources. It will support the deployment of hydrogen use for lowering the carbon footprint. The project should therefore have the following impacts:
Demonstrate ≥ 98% availability and the production of hydrogen by operation of > 1,000 h with production loss < 1.2%/kh;
The SOE with renewable heat integration shall demonstrate electrical efficiency ≥ 85% based on LHV and specific energy consumption of <39 kWh/kg H2 in a market-representative relevant environment;
Make SOE technology a suitable path for cheap green hydrogen production in places where both renewable heat and electricity are available and without a waste steam supply (e.g. from industry);
Efficient operation strategy of SOE coupled with two RES (electricity and heat) for facilitating RES integration in the grid and grid balancing.
The successful achievement of the project should:
Set the ground for efficient concepts of hydrogen production from renewable sources directed to sector coupling between electric and gas grids, involving SOE;
Unlock new market opportunities that shall act as an additional driver for scaling-up the European SOE technology and contribute to further reduce CAPEX;
It is expected that the deployment of RES, particularly solar thermal solutions, will leverage from the results of the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Hydrogen storage and delivery are essential components of future fuel cells and hydrogen-based technologies. Depending on applications, different sizes of storage of hydrogen close to the final use may be necessary, e.g. industrial scale storage is required to deal with imbalances between supply and use of hydrogen, those caused by fluctuations in availability of renewable electricity.
Storage and handling of hydrogen in gas phase often needs significant amount of energy for hydrogen compression up to at least 350 bar. This process is usually performed with mechanical instruments (i.e. compressors, pumps), with low efficiency and heat losses. Therefore, the use of low-pressure (i.e. lower than 50 bar) alternatives based on hydrogen carriers could decrease CAPEX and OPEX of hydrogen storage significantly.
The basic aspects of hydrogen carrier technologies are well established, but the demonstration to efficiently store and/or deliver hydrogen is still in an early stage of industrial development and while the basic aspects of individual components of such a storage solution are well established, there has not been a lot of research that focused on a proof-of-concept that demonstrates this storage solution from end to end.
Further developments and demonstration in applications with larger market potential (like e.g. low-pressure hydrogen storage in residential applications for medium to long-term energy storage or at off grid locations) are necessary.
Scope:
Novel energy efficient, compact and cost effective hydrogen carrier solutions should be developed for hydrogen storage in grid independent energy supply systems, e.g. for on-site hydrogen production from renewables connected to green hydrogen supply to FC (HT-PEFC, SOFC, etc.) to be used in stationary applications.
Safety issues for hydrogen storage and delivering should be specifically addressed. Suitable normative related to hydrogen handling using carriers should be considered. The use of non-Critical Raw Materials is highly recommended.
The projects should demonstrate a prototype of a storage system based on hydrogen carriers for an application with significant market potential, in order to move hydrogen carriers out of niche markets. The integration of the prototype system from a hydrogen production to delivering is required within the project. The results of the project will support the management of variable sources in applications at the medium – large scale, such as energy generation from power plans based on renewable sources.
Projects should achieve a break-through in increased energy efficiency and compactness of the complete system with respect to current technologies, as well as reduction of necessary hydrogen compression steps, optimizing the complete hydrogen storage and delivery chain. Depending on selected storage technology, a purification step might be included.
Project work should encompass a complete energy and cost analysis of the state-of-the-art in the specific application, including cost for hydrogen and energy supply, cost for storage including hydrogen processing as well as depreciation of system components.
The overall achieved improvements in increasing energy efficiency and safety, while reducing cost for the system itself and its maintenance should be investigated in a techno-economical evaluation of the developed system.
A LCA of the concept should be included to evaluate the potential improvement in energy efficiency and environmental performance of the complete system with respect to current technologies. The LCA should contemplate also the management of raw and waste material, as well as other recycling issues.
Based on a specific business case, the amount of H2 to be stored should be clarified and a cost analysis of the whole hydrogen storage and delivering chain should be provided.
Proposed projects should have at least one industrial partner (carrier and/or storage system production) in the consortium, to both exploit the results and prove a business case for the developed hydrogen storage solution based on the particular hydrogen carrier.
Projects within the scope of call topic FCH-02-6-2017 (Liquid organic hydrogen carrier) are not eligible for this call.

Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
The expected achievement from the project is a proof of concept of a hydrogen carrier system for stationary storage, integrated with hydrogen production from renewables and use in energy supply devices (e.g. FC). This application area is expected to provide promising export markets for the European industry.
A medium-scale prototype system with developed carriers should be demonstrated by the end of the project with a capacity of ≥ 50 kg H2 and integrated with an existing application, including hydrogen storage and delivering steps. Optimized hydrogen and thermal management should be demonstrated. The system should demonstrate a safe operation and maintenance along the whole chain, including toxicity and health aspects. An added value to the proposal is the hydrogen production and use as a part of the project, however their cost is not eligible in the proposal.
The KPIs for hydrogen storage include the whole process for carriers’ hydrogenation as well as dehydrogenation. All of the following specific KPIs should be obtained and demonstrated:
Target of hydrogen stored capacity for in-field testing > 50 kg H2;
Carrier volumetric density > 0.1 kg H2/litre;
Discharge energy use from sources external from the prototype system < 5.0 kWh/kg H2, i.e. less than 15% of the energy content of hydrogen per kg;
Total round-trip energy efficiency > 70% including compression, energy supply to store and BoP, etc.;
Loading and unloading of hydrogen has to be demonstrated in the carrier for at least 250 cycles and in the prototype for at least 50 cycles, with acceptable loss of storage capacity less than 0.2 % per cycle;
Hydrogen purity at point of delivery at least 99.99 %.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) technology is mainly considered for stationary applications. The number of units installed is growing continuously around the world, for a wide range of power (kW to MW). One of its main advantages is that it can be easily fed by different fuels, not only pure hydrogen as it is the case with other fuel cell technologies. Currently, the reference fuel is natural gas abundantly available throughout EU at low cost. Fuel cells operated with natural gas from the grid reduce already significantly the amount of CO2 generated compared to other conventional heat and power generation systems thanks to their higher efficiency, however not entirely.
In order to reach the target of greenhouse gases emissions reduction set by the EU, a reduction of the carbon footprint of the fuel has to be considered, for example by using renewable gases like biogas or hydrogen. In addition, in order to promote the storage of intermittent renewable energies through the power-to-gas concept, blending hydrogen with natural gas into the existing natural gas network is expected, though several questions remain open like the maximum admissible percentage of H2 in the natural gas and the seasonal variability of the content. The challenge is to have SOFCs able to operate under variable fuel mixtures whilst maintaining acceptable levels of performance.
Scope:
The project should develop and demonstrate in a relevant environment a stationary solid oxide fuel cell system capable to operate under variable fuel mixtures with high electrical efficiency, high heat quality, long lifetime and able to reach the cost level of conventional fuel cell systems.
The project should evaluate the operation of stationary SOFCs designed for conventional natural gas over a wide range of gas compositions including H2 mixture in natural gas from zero to 100% and additions of biogas in the gas grid.
In order to take advantage of the long and costly development done so far on natural gas fed SOFC and of the high number of units already installed, it is expected that the project focuses on the adaptation of existing SOFC systems design made for natural gas to varying mixtures, with the aim of developing the next generation of “flexifuel” fuel cell systems.
The project consortium should include at least 2 SOFC system manufacturers based in EU or H2020 Associated Country.
The project should:
Evaluate experimentally at lab scale on stack and system level, how the change of fuel can modify the performance and the durability of the fuel cell, taking in particular into account the thermal management, which will be more complex and might affect SOFC lifetime;
Implement required BoP components allowing the operation window from zero to 100% H2 in natural gas and with additions of purified biogas (CH4 and CO2, no pollutants);
Define and validate an operation strategy adapted for a flexifuel operation;
Demonstrate in relevant environment conditions and at system level, for at least 9 months, the operation in such flexifuel operating conditions; it should involve change of fuel (from 100% natural gas or biogas (potentially varying composition of biogas) to 100% H2, going through different levels of H2 admixtures in natural gas/biogas;
Address safety and certification aspects in a suitable manner taking into account all relevant directives and regulations. These activities should take into account other FCH 2 JU projects working in this area. The project should bring the fuel cell system developed as close as possible to certification considering the applicable legal basis.

Expected Impact:
Flexifuel operation of SOFC systems should target to cover long-term EU policy perspectives. Consequently, the project is expected to have the following impacts:
Demonstration of long-term operation (> 6000 h) at stack level with degradation rate below 1%/1000h in the operation window from 0 to 100% H2 in natural gas, thus proving the tolerance of H2 content in natural gas up to 100%;
Demonstrate that BoP components are compatible for this wide range of gas composition, by qualifying them for the 0-100% H2 in natural gas range in laboratory and by integrating them in SOFC systems;
BoP components allowing to reach the CAPEX targeted by the 2024 MAWP values [56];
Demonstrate the operation at system level in relevant environment, with an electrical efficiency >48% LHV for the whole operation window from 0 to 100% H2 in natural gas, a behaviour and a degradation rate similar to natural gas fed SOFC systems, and with availability >90% over the operating duration (9 months minimum);
Confirmation that flexifuel operation mode allow to reach the lifetime and efficiencies targeted by the 2024 MAWP values, thus demonstrating that SOFC systems are fully hydrogen ready;
Decrease of CO2 emissions of SOFC by at least 40% during operation as compared to a standard natural gas fuel cell fed system;
Demonstrate that the primary energy reduction through cogeneration is available also to pure hydrogen networks.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Solid oxide fuel cell technology for stationary applications is approaching the market. More and more demonstration systems are installed. One important cost aspect is the SOFC unit and its lifetime and durability, which still determine large part of the total costs. While durability studies on SOFC stacks or modules have been carried out comprehensively using advanced methodology, there is only limited monitoring of the state of the SOFC during operation in the field available or not even existing at all. That is a costly problem as the systems cannot counteract properly if a SOFC stack starts to malfunction or to degrade fatally. A stack monitoring and diagnostic methodology is therefore needed to evaluate the state of health of a working SOFC, to detect and identify critical operation, and to counteract appropriately on a system level before fatal damage has occurred on the SOFC stack.
Previous projects have proposed monitoring and diagnostic techniques for their implementation in real systems. Balance of Plant faults and stack malfunctions detection methodologies based on conventional approaches are available after the project GENIUS, which concentrated mostly on the system’s component faults identification. A further advancement has been achieved by the project DESIGN towards the development of passive signal-based techniques for the identification of high fuel utilization and slow degradation phenomena. A step forward is now being accomplished by the project DIAMOND to merge conventional monitoring and diagnostics with control techniques to improve reliability and performance of SOFC. However the state-of-the-art of EU research lacks solutions and instruments dealing with SOFC degradation and prognosis for on-field advanced monitoring that may support diagnostic and lifetime tools. A step forward is required to lift laboratory oriented techniques along with theoretical and modeling studies towards a practical implementation in real SOFC systems. Moreover, several solutions developed for PEMFC (already at TRL 4) are based on advanced monitoring and diagnostic methodologies that may be applied for SOFC as well.
Scope:
The overall objective is to develop advanced, robust and cost efficient monitoring and diagnostic tools for stacks/modules in working SOFC, which are to be integrated into the system. The challenge of advancing laboratory application and complex experimental or modeling tools towards their embedding in SOFC system must be clearly addressed. Achieving these objectives will lead to improved durability and reduction of TCO (Total cost of ownership) of SOFC systems thus fostering fuel cell market penetration.
Activities will be devoted to build a new framework for monitoring and diagnostics with high accuracy and reliability. Therefore the methodologies to identify and quantify degradation phenomena are the main scope of the topic. All available knowledge on degradation, mostly exploited for laboratory use and theoretical studies, should be used to perform on-field condition monitoring analysis (e.g. state of health) for easy-to-implement and fast lifetime prediction algorithms. The proposal should also leverage the outcomes of past and on-going projects to address the following objectives:
Enhanced understanding of stack degradation mechanisms in real operating conditions using both experimental and modelling approaches
Identify suitable monitoring parameters at stack and system levels that indicate critical state of the SOFC stack/module within the system
Define the most suitable and efficient monitoring and diagnostic tools with lifetime forecast functions embedded that do not add more than 3% to the total system manufacturing costs
Development of cost-effective monitoring methods to discover fatal degradation in time to start appropriate protective actions, thereby prolonging SOFC lifetime by 5% and increase availability by 1%
Implement the proposed algorithms in a SOFC system and perform relevant tests to demonstrate on-line the effectiveness of the developed tool
All methodologies and tools must comply with industry standards for a straightforward implementation within SOFC system monitoring and control equipment.
The activities should build on existing, available results from previous or on-going projects. SOFC systems used are expected to be at TRL 6 or higher.
TRL at start: 3
TRL at end: 5
The TRLs refer to the concerned tools for monitoring, diagnostics and lifetime estimation.
The consortium should include at least one SOFC stack/module manufacturer, research institutions and academic groups. To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to achieve a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art by achieving most of the following targets:
The most relevant degradation mechanisms in SOFC systems for specific stationary market segments have to be identified based on data for system testing and analysed with respect to impact on lifetime, such as fatal impact or slow decrease of power output (for example: redox failure, corrosion, poisoning, etc.)
Monitoring parameters have to be identified that reveal state-of-health of SOFC stacks regarding those identified critical mechanisms
Counter measures to prevent fatal SOFC stack failure have to be proposed, including possible regular treatments that prevent or slow-down long-term degradation
Integration and validation of the method into a system
It has to be shown that the added cost of the monitoring/diagnostics approach does not increase the overall system manufacturing costs by more than 3%."

Hydrogen is an important raw material for chemical syntheses (ammonia, methanol etc.), metallurgical reduction reactions and oil refining. Nowadays, it is mostly generated by reforming hydrocarbons, which is associated with a significant carbon footprint.
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis has evolved into a mature technology with promising perspectives to play a key role for production of green hydrogen in the future energy landscape. However, the use of PEM electrolysers for producing a meaningful percentage of the annual hydrogen production rate in Europe would require the installations at gigawatt scale. The electrodes of state-of-the-art PEM electrolysers require a significant loading of platinum-group metals (PGMs), particularly iridium. Hence, such a large-scale deployment of PEM electrolysers raises major concerns about the availability and price of these raw materials. On the other hand, the electrodes of alkaline water electrolysers do not require PGMs. However, at present alkaline electrolysers operate at low current densities due to the high resistance of the relatively thick separators.
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis can potentially combine the beneficial features of the PEM and alkaline electrolyser technologies, i.e. a low cost, raw materials that do not raise concerns in terms of supply bottlenecks (electrodes that do not include PGMs, stainless steel current collectors), a compact design, the adoption of feeds based on non-corrosive liquids (low concentration alkali or DI water), and differential pressure operation. However, as of today AEM electrolysis is limited by AEMs exhibiting an insufficient ionic conductivity as well as a poor chemical and thermal stability. Moreover, most non-PGM electrocatalysts, in addition to poor electrical conductivity mentioned, are only stable above pH 12, and really active at pH 14. Therefore, new material breakthroughs and design concepts are needed before AEM technology can challenge PEM electrolysers. These include:
Increase in membrane and ionomer conductivity and stability;
Decrease in membrane thickness while retaining good gas separation;
Improve mechanical stability;
Optimize chemical composition and activity of non-PGM electrocatalysts;
Optimize electrocatalyst conductivity, dispersion and utilization in the electrode;
Improved cell design.
Scope:
The potential proposal should:
Develop and redefine new components for AEM electrolysers, including membrane, ionomers, PGM-free electrode packages, porous interconnectors and separators;
Implement the newly developed components in a 1 kW stack with a minimum of 5 cells;
Achieve current PEM electrolysis performances as defined by the MAWP, with diluted circulation of electrolytes but gradually move to pure DI water circulation (< 20 μS cm-1), reaching single-cell voltages of 2 V at 1 A cm-2 at 45°C and maintain stable performance at constant current for 2,000 h with a degradation gap of less than 50 mV;
Make a clear correlation between the developed materials/components and the achieved cell performance and durability;
Provide cost assessment for the developed technology and scale-up. The technology should clearly demonstrate component cost reduction compared to current PEM electrolysis technology.
It is expected that the consortium include industrial companies capable of scaling up and commercializing the technology developed. The focus of the project should be clear on the combination between materials research and performance testing.
It is expected that the project will contribute towards the objectives and activities of the Hydrogen Innovation Challenge (as detailed under section 3.2.G. International cooperation). Promoting international collaboration beyond EU Member States and H2020 Associated Countries is therefore strongly encouraged.
The technology should start at TRL 2 and reach TRL 4 at the end of the project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
The AEM electrolyser short stack including the newly developed components will offer a promising and cost-effective alternative to PEM electrolysis technology paving the way for larger systems. The expected impacts are:
Stable and cost-effective components for AEM water electrolysers that will reduce substantially the risk to incur in supply bottlenecks, the investment costs and thus the total €/kg H2;
New knowledge with respect to the design and operation of an AEM electrolyser stack including the new components;
Understanding of the correlation between degradation processes in materials and the operation conditions such as temperature and current density;
Increased EU competitiveness in production of green hydrogen from renewable sources at large scale.
The expected KPI to be achieved by AEMs are:
1) Area specific resistance (ASR): ≤ 0.07 Ω cm2 (room temperature);
2) OH- conductivity of membrane: 50 mS cm-1 (room temperature);
3) Swelling ratio (dry/wet): [dimensional stability]
Machine Direction (MD): ≤ 1 %;
Transverse Direction (TD): ≤ 4 %;
4) Mechanical strength: 15 MPa; elongation at break: 100 %;
5) Ionomer conductivity: 20 mS cm-1
6) Stability: 2,000 h, ASR remains.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The increase of intermittent renewable electricity (solar and wind) raises the need for more flexibility in the power market and falling costs of renewable power open up the possibility to generate hydrogen at large scale from renewable power through electrolysis. Several sectors, namely the steel, refineries, chemistry, transport and even the natural gas sectors are exploring the reduction of their CO2 footprint by incorporating large quantities of renewable hydrogen in their processes.
This topic aims to demonstrate a large scale electrolyser generating bulk renewable hydrogen for use in one or a combination of these sectors. The electrolyser technology should be further up scaled, in view of reducing investment costs by economies of scale and developed to operate flexibly when power prices are low and provide grid balancing services.
The challenges addressed by the project are:
Demonstration of a large electrolysis unit (min 10MW) using the latest available technology with a very low capital investment;
Providing large quantities of renewable hydrogen on a commercial basis for targeted large scale applications, or within industries or in the transport;
Demonstrate the value of the flexibility of the electrolyser on a commercial basis by providing advanced grid balancing services;
Integration of a large scale flexible hydrogen production unit with the end user demand profile.
Recent years of R&D have significantly improved the production ramp up and down flexibility of electrolysis technology and improved the scalability from kW to MW size. What is still lacking is large scale infield demonstration at sites where both grid services are required and where hydrogen can be valorized in large quantities. Only such applications can provide both the scale for providing grid balancing and reaching cost levels where additional revenue can be generated from hydrogen distribution and sales.
Scope:
This Innovation Action seeks proposals which demonstrate improved electrolyser technologies beyond actual state-of-the-art producing hydrogen with favorable economic conditions, e.g. when power prices are low, when additional revenue can be generated by providing high value grid balancing services and where the CO2 reduction footprint can be valorized.
The scope of the project is:
To develop a new large scale electrolyser of minimum 10 MW of sufficiently rapid response time (of the order of a few seconds), to participate in the existing primary and secondary grid balancing markets and explore possibilities of more advanced grid services. The installed power and operating regime should be duly justified to identify the advantages offered to the grid within the long term business model. The hydrogen purity should meet the application requirements. The output pressure shall be designed to fulfill, when possible, the required pressure for the hydrogen application targeted - including buffer storage needs if any - and reduce as far as possible the need for dedicated hydrogen compression units downstream. Storage and compression are not in the scope of this topic;
To demonstrate a minimal footprint of the electrolyser, with a single balance of plant including all required electrolysis utilities such as water purification, power rectification with suited grid interfaces, and hydrogen purification for delivery to the proposed application sector. The 10MW scale unit should be designed as a building block for the plants of the future. Industrial integration with certification attested by a Notified Body involvement should be included;
To focus on specific improvements of the current state-of-the-art related to the electrolyser operation under partial loads, quick response, system operation for providing reserve and frequency response services, forecasting models for electricity price and renewable energy production;
To demonstrate an energy consumption consistent with 2020 expectations of 48 kWh/kg @1000+/kg for PEM technology at nominal power [1];
To demonstrate a CAPEX for the electrolyser consistent with 2020 expectations of 1000 €/kW for PEM technology at nominal power. These target costs do not include the specific tailoring of the electrolysis to be compatible with the grid services to be brought;
To demonstrate the economic benefits of the project for the selected application. Here, the consortium will demonstrate that they are able to obtain these revenues by entering into commercial contracts with the chain stakeholders (e.g. grid operators or utilities) who value these services. The value could be demonstrated also by other means that confirms the revenue potential;
The proposal will indicate the operating scenarios, the duration of production, the quantities of hydrogen produced, the use foreseen and a detailed business case analysis. State of the art electrolysers and downstream systems must be installed and operated for a minimum period of two years;
Electrolyser systems will strive to demonstrate a sufficient level of responsiveness to meet the requirements of the produced hydrogen for the services offered and power price opportunities, (e.g. for rapid modulation, rapid start, frequency response, as required by the services offered to the grid); this will be done in collaboration with chain operators of the market sector identified;
Consortia will preferably build upon outcome from previous projects funded by the FCH-JU and on already feasible business cases, so that potential customers do not discontinue the use of the installation after project end, but on the contrary support continued market roll-out efforts. The proposal must include an initial plan for use of the installation after the project. The proposal is expected to address new applications than the one already supported (i.e. steel industry).
To address adequately the challenges of this project, the consortium should include at least the electrolyser manufacturer, the hydrogen end-user and a power services company or the local power grid operator.
Specifically, the consortium should include strong links to:
the necessary contractual and commercial expertise to access revenues from the grid services and/or power price opportunities;
technical expertise for the design, provision and operation of the electrolyser and associated hydrogen distribution and supply technologies;
market access for downstream provision of hydrogen in the selected application.
The capacity of the electrolyser should be linked to the budget via the cost KPIs in the MAWP but also reflect the specific tailoring costs for ensuring electrolysis is compatible with the grid services requirements. The grid connection costs, building costs and the electricity costs for the commissioning phase are eligible for the funding. Electricity costs during demonstration / business operation are not eligible. The results of a techno-economic assessment must be published after each year of operation, including information on the individual cost and revenue streams related to the electrolyser. The Technical report however should present these figures for techno-economic assessment purposes.
Storage/compression costs should not be included.
To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping.
It is expected that the technology starts at TRL 7 and reaches TRL 8 at the end of the project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 10 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 5 years

Expected Impact:
The proposal is expected to demonstrate in an operational environment improved electrolysis technology configured to attract revenues from grid services and/or power price opportunities in addition to providing bulk renewable hydrogen to an industrial scale hydrogen user.
The consortium will ensure that actions are included in the project to generate learning and reach KPI and commercial targets, such as:
Demonstrating feasible operation of large scale rapid response electrolysis and the integration the produced electrolytic hydrogen in an established industrial process;
Assessment and operation experience, including safety, of the contractual and hardware arrangements required to distribute and supply hydrogen to the specific industrial and / or transport market;
Implementation of the necessary grid interfaces to provide grid balancing services;
Perform techno-economic analysis of the performance of these systems;
Evaluation of the environmental performance of the system in alignment with the recommendations of the CertifHy project – with attention to the CO2 intensity of the hydrogen produced, which should include an understanding of the CO2 impact of the grid services mode selected and CO2 footprint impact in the addressed hydrogen end-user markets;
Projections of the value and size of the markets addressed by provision of the grid balancing services and supply to multiple hydrogen markets, not excluding the transport sector;
Assessment and operation experience of the contractual and hardware arrangements required to access the balancing services and operate the electrolyser systems;
Assessment of the legislative and RCS implications of these systems and any issues identified in obtaining consents to operate the system;
Recommendations for policy makers and regulators on measures required to stimulate the market for these systems.
Versions of ‘lessons learnt’ reports addressed to the public should be prepared and disseminated across Europe and potentially wider."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Each year about 50 M ton of hydrogen is produced in majority at refineries by steam methane reforming. Most of it is purified using large pressure swing absorption systems. For a continuous flow of pure hydrogen, multiple units are required, operating in out-of-phase duty cycles, demanding a substantial investment for refineries and producing a waste fraction, normally used for heat generation. Especially at lower scale, PSA systems are not meeting cost targets (CAPEX & OPEX). For new hydrogen production methods without heat demand like biomass fermentation and for hydrogen from industrial hydrogen pipelines and underground caverns, innovative and lean hydrogen purification technologies, alternative to conventional purification technologies like PSA or cryogenic evaporation are needed.
This topic calls for proposals to develop innovative membrane based hydrogen purification methods fit for dynamic hydrogen demand at lower scale and high hydrogen purity requirements. NCNG applications are excluded from this topic.
Scope:
The scope of this topic comprises the proof-of-concept and optimization of hydrogen purification technologies that meet the purity requirements for fuel cells used in stationary and transport applications. These systems should be optimized for stand-alone operation with minimum H2 concentration in the feed gas of 50%, used for purification from the new hydrogen production methods, delivery and storage sources.
Proposals for projects are expected to address small-scale clean-up steps of H2 produced from new production methods.
The project(s) shall take into account the following overall technology objectives:
Low overall energy consumption. This includes energy input, H2 losses and energy required for re-compression to input pressure. The operational cost of purification is expected to be a small fraction of the final hydrogen cost
Low investment cost. This includes small-scale gas clean-up and purification processes
The project should include:
Development of a stand-alone hydrogen purification system
Validation of the hydrogen purification technology in a relevant simulated environment
Cost assessment of the developed hydrogen purification technology, addressing operational and installation cost of the system including the required cleaning up processes and benchmarking with the conventional PSA
Projects are expected to start at TRL 3 and to reach TRL 5.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
A maximum of 1 project will be funded under this topic
Expected Impact:
A step change in installation and operational cost for a membrane based, small scale stand-alone hydrogen purification system is expected:
The purification technology needs to show a hydrogen recovery of above 90%
Hydrogen purity must comply with the SAE2719 or ISO 14687-2/3 standards on hydrogen quality for fuel cell vehicles, reaching a minimum of 5 N
Output capacity (depending on H2 purity and feed gas flow) should range between 2-5 kgH2/day
Energy consumption of Hydrogen purification technology should be able to achieve 5 kWh/kg H2
Reduction of CAPEX compared to state of art (e.g. PSA purification) to 1500€/kg H2/day"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
According to COM(2015) 80 final, 25/02/2015 on the Energy Union Package, the vision of the Energy Union is a sustainable, low-carbon and climate-friendly economy that is designed to last; the vision is of strong, innovative and competitive European companies that develop the industrial products and technology needed to deliver energy efficiency and low carbon technologies inside and outside Europe (the European Council set in October 2014 an indicative target at the EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency in 2030, and the agreement on the 2030 climate and energy framework has defined the EU commitment of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990); most importantly, the vision is of an Energy Union with citizens at its core, where citizens take ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills, participate actively in the market, and where vulnerable consumers are protected (e.g. facilitating the participation of consumers in the energy transition through smart grids, smart home appliances, smart cities, and home automation systems).
It is in this context necessary to fundamentally rethink energy efficiency and treat it as an energy source in its own right, representing the value of energy saved. As part of the market design review, the Commission will ensure that energy efficiency and demand side response can compete on equal terms with generation capacity, in particular in the transport and buildings sector.
All above Energy Union main challenges (especially those on energy efficiency and emissions targets) can be partially addressed by the distributed Combined Heat and Power, CHP technology, in particular micro-CHP based on fuel cells technology (for residential applications area)[1] which can reduce CO2 emissions by more than 30% compared to the condensing boiler (normal conventional technology), while NOx emissions can be eliminated entirely; and can be more efficient than central generation due to superior technologies and avoidance of transmission losses for a potential mass-market of more than 2.5 million units annually in core European countries.
In general, the fuel cell system has the best net energy performance and can further improve its competitiveness by decreasing capital costs; however, to become economically competitive, capital costs must be reduced substantially by increasing production volumes, while improving the technology through similar learning curve: many production steps are still manually performed and learning effects from Japan cannot be adopted. Larger volumes (of at least 500 units per manufacturer) will allow for automation and bundled sourcing strategies; in addition, standardisation must increase within and across technology lines; finally, further research on how efficiency can be improved by next generation system design is needed (increase of electrical efficiency to 65% and total efficiency to 95-99%) and further optimisation of running modes and operating models should be done (durability increase to 15 years for the stack and up to 20 years for the entire system).
The first demonstration stage of such applications (about 50-150 units per manufacturer) has started in Europe around 2007-2008 with National initiatives on field trials and demonstration programmes (e.g. Danish µCHP-demonstration, and Callux, FuelCell@Home in Germany) and it has been continued at European scale with the projects SOFT-PACT and ene.field (after 2010), in order to first try to build a European value and supply chain, but also experiment the different routes-to-market in about 10-12 EU Member States; overall around 10 major European manufacturers have successfully demonstrated the technology readiness by installing and operating approximately approx. 1,300 systems (800 units only in Germany). It is therefore expected that the customer requirements such as very high efficiency, significant CO2-reduction and competitive operating costs could be achieved.
The second stage demonstration/field trials should also continue to demonstrate the technology at least in the main markets identified by the first demonstration/field trials, but also try to identify new markets opportunity, depending on the energy spark-spread of each region or Member State.
Scope:
The main focus of this topic is to initiate a second generation large scale demonstration of µCHP fuel cells destined for the residential and small commercial applications (0.3-5 kW); it will require further improvements of units/system concepts demonstrated in previous initiatives and build upon those results. This represents the second step of demonstration for the manufacturers (incl. all types of FC technologies) at a more advanced phase of the learning curve (i.e. ramp-up phase) which will ensure ramp-up in the range of 2.500 units in one/two-family homes (eventually small commercial applications in Europe).
The technology and system integration aspects in the <5kW part of topic 2.6 are closely linked to this topic and synergies between these topics should therefore be sought within the scope of these projects. This topic puts significant focus on the further development of the FC stack, being the main innovative element in a FC system and a prerequisite for the success and competitiveness of the European µCHP sector in future. The project scope should also address the practical functionality of the system, with the synergies from topic 2.6, including further improved and validated BoP components in terms of concept, robustness and increased lifetimes, while exploring the possibility for standardisation; the integration in Europe’s energy system with higher rates of RES (e.g. as VPP), stabilisation/standardisation of supply chains; innovative marketing and sales strategies, innovative business models, implementation of financial facilities; finally, the upgrading of already developed solutions such as monitoring, control, diagnosis, lifetime estimation should be addressed too.
The project should mainly:
Demonstrate in the field in the range of 2,500 µCHP units with at least 500 units or 500 kWel per manufacturer and a minimum of 3 manufacturers; these manufacturers should have been successful in first generation field-trials (successful operation of min. 250,000 kWh produced cumulated and fleet availability of at least 90% in previous field-trials for at least 100 units or 100kWel is a pre-requisite)
Demonstrate, evaluate and optimize new solutions and components especially at the FC stack level but also on systems levels through field tests with improved product concepts e.g. pre-serial status as compared to previous field trials, by validating next generations of product designs
Increase lifetime of stack and other components of BoP; each manufacturer has to double the stack lifetime during the project as compared to the state-of-art figures
Test and demonstration of new models, among the 2500 units, which should minimize installation efforts and installation failures
Increase robustness of fuel cell system to achieve availability of at least 99% in the fleet to be demonstrated
Test and demonstration of remote control models with regards of grid stability support of Virtual Fuel Cell Power Plants as part of Europe’s future renewable energy system
Establish a demonstration/commercialisation pathway for European SMEs innovating in the development, manufacture and supply chain of fuel cell µCHP components
Verification of heat and power contracting business models for applicable markets by the manufacturers present in the project
Specifically identify further installation sites as base for large scale deployment; Establish a “technical label” assuring the financial viability for system installation for further installation sites
Establish the basis and further develop, if possible marketing and sales strategies of European µCHP manufacturers; qualify to open the access to conventional financing for customers, be it private households, utilities or other kinds; proven solid business model in practical manner for a significant number of systems providing pathways to allow full commercial deployment
Increase awareness in European markets for µCHP fuel cells
It is expected that the applicants in the consortium will have significant experience of manufacturing, installing and testing fuel cell µCHP units; participating manufacturers have to present a clear strategy on how to grow their installed base, this demonstration presenting a stepping stone for growth beyond. This strategy needs to be in line with the corporation’s strategic targets and is expected to be part of bigger additional activities plan. Marketing, sales and deployment plans need to be approved on strategic level of the company, i.e. by senior executive management of the sales and after-sales organisation of the manufacturer. Each manufacturer has to show recent value created in a European member state in at least 3 EU member states, e.g. by creation and protection of jobs in Europe, strengthening of existing or establishment of new competitive key suppliers for the FCH industry.
The project will also demonstrate through field applications the advantages of innovative technologies (hardware or software) including, but not limited to, monitoring, control, diagnosis, lifetime estimation, new BoP components. Furthermore, any methodology that may improve the knowledge and the quantification of those processes causing lifetime and performance reduction may be considered as a valuable solution to be tested and demonstrated in the field. The project will implement each solution on a limited scale basis for the purpose of demonstrating their feasibility and the advantages brought to the on-board application.
The project is linked with topic FCH.02.6-2015 (Development of cost effective manufacturing technologies for key components or fuel cell systems) to enable demonstration in the field of new developed components and manufacturing processes. Data gained in the project should be fed into the HIAD database.
The project is encouraged to look for additional/complimentary funding from regional or National funding bodies which should result in demonstration of additional number of units, up to the necessary total number of units for this second generation stage (about 10.000 units, according to the Roland Berger Study, before starting the deployment phase).
Expected Impact:
The project shall explicitly strengthen the European value chain in particular for the critical components such as fuel cell stack, reformers (incl. desulphurization), special heat exchangers, inverters, etc. Proposals have to explain which of these issues can be addressed by scaling up in order to strengthen European industry competiveness. This large scale demonstration will as well initiate the drive to achieving economies of scale and hence significantly reduce costs enabling further phase roll-outs/deployment stage to be funded at lower rates by Member States after 2020.
The proposals are expected to have the impacts described below:
The main objective of this topic is to achieve significant improvements in the technical and economic performance of the FC stack and its manufacturing:
Reduction of the FC stack production cost with at least 30%
Application of innovative production methods, demonstrated through increase of production capacity with at least 30% and an increased share of automation
Improving the lifetime of the stack and demonstrate the durability in relation to thermal cycling
The above is expected to contribute, together with progress in the system integration to a capital cost (CAPEX) reduction of at least 30% on FC system level compared to today’s average system costs, aiming at a level of less than 10.000 €/kW which can provide the right level of competiveness for large deployment phase after 2020
Increased system lifetime to more than 15 years and maintenance interval by new/improved components (e.g. in case of new desulphurisation component: new solutions should be found and demonstrated to provide maintenance free over lifetime, which would lower the maintenance costs, OPEX significantly and therefore improve LCOE/RoI for the customer side)
Contribute to significant further capital cost reduction enable to tightened start investments in European production facilities for further ramp-up in European markets
Reinforce European supply chain of critical key components by e.g. a higher range of common/standardised parts to be produced in Europe
Stimulate private investments in production lines and facilities in Europe from today’s yearly ‘hand-made’ volumes (50 – 100) to a capability of minimum yearly 1,000 systems
Generate cost decreases on core components potentially transferable to other product families and enabling accelerated product deployment in the commercial size FC market segment in principle
Explore the implementation of financial facilities that provide capital for the next step of µCHP deployment, e.g. through the European Investment Bank, market incentive schemes in addressed EU markets, etc.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The path towards a well-established hydrogen economy requires the deployment of sustainable FCH systems. Moreover, such an economy should contribute to the circularity concept. Furthermore, considering that the transition to such an economy will require significant investments, it is important that FCH projects are considered sustainable investments, as specific budgets and funds have been dedicated to investments classified as such. Although FCH technologies are already both explicitly and implicitly mentioned in the Taxonomy Technical Report on sustainable investments [85], the acceptance of FCH technologies as sustainable investment would greatly benefit from factual support.
Within this context, it is of paramount importance to screen and develop eco-efficient actions for the (re)design of FCH products (design for excellence, DfX). For instance, actions regarding the use of secondary raw materials in stack components that include critical raw materials should consider not only FCH products’ manufacture but also end-of-life (EoL), paying special attention to the quality of the recovered materials (PGMs, ionomer, carbon, etc.). Hence, a holistic approach needs to be followed in order to propose, screen and prioritise actions that minimise the environmental impact of FCH products along their life cycle from the design phase until EoL, without jeopardising (but promoting) their economic feasibility.
This need for the thorough integration of environmental traits into the design of FCH products calls for the development of tailor-made eco-design guidelines, thereby filling the current gap for this type of reference documentation.
Furthermore, this topic addresses the challenge of generating a scientific basis that facilitates the future standardisation of the manufacture of key FCH products’ components, with emphasis on design solutions that allow an effective implementation of EoL technologies as well as an automatic and non-destructive disassembly of FCH products (design for recycling).
In this sense, according to the EU action plan for the circular economy [86], only high quality recycling can ensure the recovery of critical raw materials and it will be essential to improve the recyclability of electronic devices through product design.

[86] https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52015DC0614&from=EN
Scope:
The objective of this topic is to develop eco-design guidelines that include well-defined solutions for FCH products under the DfX paradigm, where X represents several features such as manufacture, assembly, cost, dismantling, recycling, reuse, etc. Projects proposed under this topic should take into consideration good practices and frameworks from more mature sectors (e.g. catalytic converters at the automotive industry, primary and secondary batteries etc.) as well as the outcomes of the project HyTechCycling (e.g. review on RCS and EoL technologies and strategies) [87].
The focus of this topic should be at least on two key FCH products (PEM fuel cells and electrolysers, alkaline water electrolysers, solid oxide fuel cells…). The integration of the environmental dimension into the design of these FCH products should pursue the minimisation of the current product’s environmental impacts (carbon footprint, energy footprint, abiotic depletion, human toxicity etc.) throughout its whole value chain, conceiving, appraising and prioritising potential actions for its enhancement.
The guidelines should focus on the identification of these actions for the target products, with advances in the product design methodology while integrating environmental aspects in such a way that they can be updated according to future progress in the field of life cycle assessment of FCH systems. The prioritised solutions should be feasible for wide implementation across EU in the medium term, thereby effectively contributing to the eco-design of FCH products. As an additional step within the well-established eco-design methodology, the impact reductions of the eco-designed FCH products should be appraised and benchmarked to check the suitability of the prioritised solutions. According to the focus on the product, the collaboration with industry stakeholders as well as the establishment of an Advisory Board is considered important to both retrieve a complete set of data and propose, screen and prioritise eco-design actions. Since the environmental results should be interpreted in combination with other aspects, especially economic indicators, the use of the standardised methodology of eco-efficiency assessment is recommended. Besides, the project approach should take into account the EU Taxonomy framework [88], as an integral part of sustainable economic development to support economic growth while reducing pressures on the environment and taking into account social and governance aspects.
For a reduced set of prioritised eco-design actions within the guidelines (at least one per FCH product addressed), it should be checked how the different actors involved could benefit from the eco-design process, including EoL recovery and recycling. It is expected that the consortium includes experts in the field of design of FCH products, eco-design, and industry actors relevant to the prioritised eco-design solutions.
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
Cross-collaboration with the project to be funded under topic FCH-04-5-2020: Guidelines for Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) of fuel cell and hydrogen systems should be sought especially on common approaches to sustainability issues and their impact on future eco-design of products. Furthermore, the extent to which eco-design actions would contribute to FCH products being more comprehensively included in the taxonomy on sustainable investments should be considered.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 1 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years.

Expected Impact:
The main outcome of the project should be the delivery of eco-design guidelines for FCH products (one eco-design guideline per involved FCH product, with a minimum of 2 guidelines).
Overall, the project should therefore contribute to:
The availability of eco-design guidelines not only for their straightforward use for the FCH products involved in the project, but also for their supporting use as reference documentation for subsequent protocols and/or standards;
Developing FCH devices designed to allow their easy dismantling and disassembly;
Reducing the use of the critical materials listed by the European Commission present in the FCH products involved in the project through substitution, otherwise by resorting to recycling strategies;
Consolidating FCH products as sustainable energy solutions through increased circularity and sound eco-efficiency reporting of every eco-design action and solution addressed in the project. In this regard, cumulative cost and environmental reductions above 3% and 10% are targeted for the eco-designed products, with eco-efficiency improvements above 10%.
The conditions related to this topic are provided in the chapter 3.3 of the FCH2 JU 2020 Annual Work Plan and in the General Annexes to the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018– 2020 which apply mutatis mutandis.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
As a prenormative project the topic addresses mainly those areas where LH2 specific standards do not exist or should get reworked. Rather it addresses all safety related standards and regulations (ATEX directive, etc…) requiring a minimum safety performance of the respective technology (refuelling, transport, etc). However, there are a few international standards already dealing with LH2 like ISO 13984:1999 Liquid hydrogen - Land vehicle fuelling system interface, ISO 13985:2006 Liquid hydrogen - Land vehicle fuel tanks, the ISO/TR 15916:2015 Basic considerations for the safety of hydrogen systems, or ISO Standard 21012:2006 Cryogenic vessels - Hoses (Applicable to fuel storage system design) which should be revised on the basis of the outcome of the project. As EU regulations are built on or tend to refer to international standards (“modern approach”) there are actually no LH2 specific regulations at all.
For scaling up the hydrogen supply infrastructure the transport of liquefied hydrogen is the most effective option due to the energy density. Especially for the transport sector with the planned large bus fleets, the emerging hydrogen fuelled train, boat and truck projects and even for the pre-cooled 70 MPa car refuelling liquid hydrogen (LH2) offers sufficient densities and gains in efficiency over gaseous transport, storage and supply. However, LH2 implies specific hazards and risks, which are very different from those associated with the relatively well-known compressed gaseous hydrogen. Although these specific issues are usually well reflected and managed in large-scale industry and aerospace applications of LH2, experience with LH2 in a distributed energy system is lacking. Transport and storage of LH2 in urban areas and the daily use by the untrained general public will require higher levels of safety provisions accounting for the very special properties. The quite different operational conditions compared with the industrial environment and therefore also different potential accident scenarios will put an emphasis on specific related phenomena which are still not well understood. Specific recommendations and harmonised performance based international standards are lacking for similar reasons. However, for a safe scale-up of the described promising hydrogen solutions science based and validated tools for hydrogen safety engineering and risk informed, performance based, international standards specific for LH2 technologies are imperative.
So the potential for increased handling and distribution of LH2 in the public highlights the need to address unanswered questions related to these prototypical accident scenarios via pre-normative research, thorough laboratory scale experimental and theoretical investigations. In particular, appropriate models for the flashing multiphase, multicomponent release phenomena, cryogenic plumes and jets, the potential for flame acceleration and deflagration-detonation-transition in these multiphase mixtures, have to be developed on a new experimental basis. The suitability of conventional mitigation techniques needs to be checked carefully and partially overly conservative safety distance requirements have to be revised on the basis of an improved understanding of the physics and with the help of the new models. The intrinsic safety advantages of LH2 over compressed hydrogen offer indeed a high potential for safer, more economic innovative solutions. However, this potential might be used only if the required knowledge base is provided.
Scope:
The scope of this topic encompasses pre-normative research on the associated risks related to the accidental behaviour of LH2 and finally the derivation of suitable engineering correlations and enhanced recommendations for safe design and operations of LH2 technologies.
In a more detailed view, the envisaged project shall develop a suitable detailed experimental program, which shall be derived from internationally agreed priorities. The preliminary list of critical phenomena presented in the specific challenge paragraph above has to be revised to comply with those topics which receive highest ranks from all stakeholders, mainly research and industry. Thus the generated experimental program and the accompanying analytical and numerical studies will improve the understanding of the most relevant safety related issues of distributed use of LH2 in the most efficient way.
The generated experimental results shall be extensively documented, published and translated into easily applied, but sufficiently conservative criteria or engineering correlations, directly applicable in the design process or associated risk assessment procedures. Implementation of the criteria and correlations in an open software integration platform for risk assessment or improved design of mitigation concepts shall be envisaged. New recommendations and guidelines including appropriate safety distance correlations and advice for proper use of mitigation technologies shall be derived. Thus, the results shall support the further development of the related specific international standards via a solid extended scientific basis. A set of communication peer reviewed papers shall be prepared, suitable to internationally disseminate the findings of the project to the different stakeholders.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
It is obvious that in particular in the field of hydrogen safety international collaboration with similar activities ongoing in IPHE countries will be an advantage and will strengthen the whole FCH community.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
Closure of knowledge gaps related to the LH2 behaviour in accidental conditions related to the new public use case
Enhancement of the state-of-the-art by development, verification and validation of predictive models, analytical and numerical tools for characterization of LH2 hazards and associated risk mitigation barriers
Review of existing standards against new knowledge and missing to suggest the implementation and modification of standards
Provision and execution of specific experiments and tests according new phenomena concerning the physical behaviour of LH2
Providing appropriate guidelines for safe design, based on the experimental results and simulations, implementation and operations of distributed LH2 logistic systems
Inclusion of the enhanced state-of-the-art, the related models and recommendations in updated or new specific, performance based, new international standards
Exploiting the potential of LH2 for safer and more economic innovative hydrogen technology solutions
Enabling FCH industry scaling-up attractive hydrogen technologies mainly in the transport sector

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Public awareness and social acceptance regarding FCH technologies have an essential role on the market uptake of FCH applications, as they foster the commercial demand and strengthen the integration and deployment of available and future FCH technologies in both public and private sectors.
FCH technologies have positive impact on increasing the use of renewable resources and renewable energy and on the reduction of CO2 emissions. Moreover, FCH technologies are the ideal link to couple different sectors of the energy mix such as the electricity grid, gas grid, etc. strengthening the entire energy sector. The benefits of implementing hydrogen as energy carrier and fuel cells into the energy system must be known and communicated to the society.
Nevertheless, the majority of FCH technologies are not well known by the public and they are not mentioned in books and lectures. Overcoming this gap is a major European challenge. To address this, a “bottom up approach” starting at pupils (primary and secondary schools) appears to be one of the most promising approaches to transfer the essential knowledge to the public. On one hand, this ensures the education of the highly qualified workforce needed by the FCH industry in the coming years, and on the other hand, increases the public awareness about the role of FCH technologies to achieve the energy transition.
Previous FCH JU activities on education and training have targeted specific groups i.e. undergraduates, postgraduates and professionals (HYPROFESSIONALS, TRAINHY-PROF, HyFacts, Knowhy, HyResponse). Targeting primary and secondary schools and their teachers will ensure that FCH technologies are presented within the energy context among other technologies generally known (PV, wind, batteries…) at a very early stage of education. This will benefit beyond the school gates, e.g. friends, parents and relatives and this will bring opportunities to initiate interest to pupils to be informed and well educated on the functioning and possibilities of FCH technologies before they chose their carrier choices.
Scope:
The project is expected to provide a set of educational materials (documents, presentations, fact sheets, practical exercises, etc.) adapted to the respective level of pupils to follow up successfully the “bottom up approach” of communication and dissemination of knowledge about FCH technologies.
The project is expected to build communication channels down to schools, teachers and education and public authorities in order to ensure the alignment of the education materials on national levels and level of education (primary and secondary). The project should connect with local, regional and national organisations to identify and engage schools in a programme of workshops or educational activities and should identify key local stakeholders to be part of the educational programme delivery. Appropriate channels may include national, regional and city hydrogen FCH associations and partnerships, existing education networks, etc.
As an essential part to the success of the project, a specific project website should be developed as a “connecting point” to exchange educational materials and to assist communication generally (e.g. by guidelines and instructions). The project website should also make more visible the FCH industry and its activities as well as research and development, providing further information on the technology.
To motivate pupils, an open contest should be organised to increase participation to the educational program, e.g. by offering an award to schools or classes in each respective country for the best “new idea on FCH application to contribute to fight the climate change”. The project should put in place a jury and the criteria to award the prices.
The project is expected to address the following activities:
Development of educational materials (e.g. slides, practical exercises) on respective level of education (primary and secondary schools) concentrating on explanation of technology, its functioning and application and its role in the global energy context;
Translation of developed educational materials to at least 10 different European languages (e.g. assisted by international colleagues or FCH associations);
The development of a programme of workshops or educational activities in the targeted countries.
Development of a specific project website as “connecting point” to exchange educational materials and providing further explanations, instructions, guidelines etc.;
Announcing an annual award to the best “…..” (theme and scope open) in each country and level of education to motivate the willingness of teachers and pupils on learning about FCH technologies; including an award ceremony.
Establish an educational programme delivery model that is sustainable in time and linked to industry priorities.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 0.5 million per project would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 2 years.
Expected Impact:
To raise public awareness and acceptance across Europe on FCH technologies and its significant contribution to achieve the European energy targets, including a set of indicators to quantify the awareness raised by the project activities in the targeted countries at local (e.g. city), regional and national level;
To increase awareness and interest of FCH technologies amongst school pupils and their teachers on the potential of FCH technologies to achieve the European energy targets and to offer qualified job opportunities with the integration of the developed educational materials into general lectures on energy, including a set of indicators to quantify the awareness raised by the project activities in the targeted countries;
An accessible European web-based platform as “connecting point” to exchange educational materials and providing further explanations, instructions, guidelines, etc;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Previous research initiatives, such as HyTechCycling project [89],[90] have identified the current absence of viable and up-scalable recycling technologies for fuel cells products as a possible bottleneck to future mass deployment of the technology. The recovery and reuse of these and other materials can contribute to reducing the overall system costs. On top of that, critical raw materials can also represent bottlenecks in the supply chains due to low availability. This is valid in first instance for the platinum group metals (PGM) used as electro-catalysts in the fuel cell and electrolyser stack, but also for the raw earth metals of the high temperature stacks. Additional potentially critical materials can be identified in the ionomer used in the membrane and the printed circuit boards used in the balance-of-plant components.
On top of these economic consideration, and even more importantly, the sustainability aspects of the whole value chains has to be considered. Since a major increment of fuel cells and hydrogen devices is expected in the next few years (20-40 GW of electrolysis together with about 10,000 units of FCs are expected to be installed in EU by 2030), suitable recycling technologies have to be available to enable the development of a hydrogen circular economy.
There is currently no process to recycle some key components of FCH devices (e.g. the materials of solid oxide devices, PGM of electrolysers), while for other devices available recovery processes already used in other sectors need important modifications to be applied to fuel cells technologies (e.g. the recovery of Pt from catalytic converters). Therefore, the design and development of suitable end of life strategies and recycling technologies should be addressed.

[90] HyTechCycling, Grant No. 700190, D 3.1 – New end of life technologies applicable to FCH products, 2018
Scope:
The overall objective of this topic is to develop and validate materials recovery and recycling technologies for key FCH products in order to reduce the costs of FCH devices, optimise the recovery of critical materials and facilitate a well-established hydrogen economy.
To this end, various physical, chemical and thermal processes should be identified, assessed and ranked to optimise the overall materials recovery. A whole Life Cycle approach needs to be undertaken in order to truly characterise the Life cycle Sustainability Impact of the proposed solutions. This should initially be studied on an environmental (LCA) and later on an economic (LCC) basis. In addition, quality analysis methods for secondary product (material) should be recommended at the end of the recovery process, aiming at labelling the recovered material suitable to be (1) reused in a new FCH product with a similar value to the original one (closed-loop recycling) or (2) reused in another sector requiring lower-value applications (open-loop recycling).
The proposal should address at least the following objectives:
Adaptation and validation in a relevant environment of processes already existing in conventional recycling and recovery centres to make them suitable to fuel cell and hydrogen commercial systems, including key materials such as the PGMs;
Selection and validation in a relevant environment of at least two novel recycling techniques for key materials contained in to fuel cell and hydrogen commercial products, such as PEMFC/PEMWE, AWE and SOFC; the focus should be on the recovery of precious metals used in the stacks as catalysts, pre-costumer scraps etc.;
Validation of the suitability of the material(s) recovered for their reintroduction in the supply chain of different FCH systems and/or different industrial sectors. The validation should include the testing of secondary raw materials in a laboratory-scale environment to demonstrate the absence of impact in the performance of the FCH system using the recovered material, while ensuring the quality standards of industry in open and/or close-loops recycling applications;
A comprehensive environmental-economic analysis of the considered strategy should be undertaken, to examine the potential for its widespread implementation in EU across the period 2025-2050. Analysing/proposing B2B recycling arrangements for each PGM and other critical raw materials, and the efficiency of recovery of each for a few subcategories of FC application and electrolyser application is suggested.
The processes developed shall aim at the following targets: manufacturing of new stacks should include min. 30% of recycled critical raw materials, 95% of Pt and 70% of ionomer, recovered over all potential streams (pre-customer scraps and and-of-life products).
It is expected that OEMs relevant to the selected technologies will be part of the proposal, to guarantee the required industrial know-how and to provide the real-life aged components and samples necessary to validate the recovery and recycling process. The proposal should also involve recovery and recycling companies and experts in the field of feasibility assessment from a life-cycle perspective, and the consortium should include industrial companies capable of scaling up the outcomes of the proposal.
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the methodology, a minimum of two recycling processes for 2 different FCH products’ materials should be validated in the relevant environment. Technical training focused on recycling and dismantling FCH technologies should be developed and provided to the recycling company. The teaching material should be made publicly available.
The validation of the recovery and recycling process should be carried in an operational environment and in coordination and agreement with the EU recycling community, to assess and confirm its robustness.

The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge.

The expected impacts are:
Development and optimisation of a recovery and recycling processes as critical component of a circular economy approach to the whole to fuel cell and hydrogen technology chain;
These processes can act as basis for further development to other products;
Reduction of the overall costs of fuel cells and hydrogen products;
Reduction of EU dependences on critical raw materials.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This approach addresses key aspects of interest for the industry related to durability particularly regarding the stack components as MEA or bipolar plates. Targeting the understanding of realistic failure modes and the development of ASTs that addresses those failure modes is a valuable contribution in order to shorten the development time of new materials to be integrated in the next system generation. Actually, ASTs will allow faster evaluation of new materials and provide a standardized test to benchmark materials and/or stack components, and will accelerate the development to meet cost (100€/kW @system for passenger cars in 2020 and between 1500 and 10000 €/kW for stationary fuel cells depending on their size in 2020) and durability targets (6,000h for automotive and 80,000h in stationary applications). While different ASTs are already available (DOE-FCTT, Japan-FCCJ but no European ones), there is still a lack of correlation or transfer function to “Real World” data. As far as PEMFC are concerned, AST on electrocatalyst is the most critical, AST for membrane and support appear consolidated but have been recently adapted by DOE and no tests are available for GDLs. AST depend both on the application and on the technology. Therefore specific AST have to be developed for PEMFC and SOFC stack components in different user profiles. For SOFC, first accelerated testing have been done, but they are less advanced than in PEMFC, and in all cases they will be different in terms of solicitations.
As of today, a growing number of FCH JU demonstration projects involving hydrogen technologies (buses, cars, stationary applications) are ongoing and expected in Europe. Some monitoring is in place providing feedback regarding evolution of the performance of the system in correlation with user profile. In order to retrieve most benefits from these past or on-going demonstration projects, it is important to link these evolutions to materials evolution with quantitative data for various usages.
Scope:
The objectives of this project dealing with either transport or energy pillars and PEMFC or SOFC technology may include:
(1) Identification of degradation mechanisms and quantification of degradation on aged stack components (bipolar plates, electrodes, gas diffusion layers, membranes, cells, sealing’s …) coming from FCH JU demonstration projects,
(2) development of advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques and accelerated stress test (AST) protocols, compatible to existing test station hardware, with the identification of transfer functions of the component degradation measured in an AST to real-world behavior of that component. For PEMFC technology, finalization and validation of the new single cell design initiated by the working group coordinated by JRC has to be taken into account. Proposal and validation of AST from materials to stack components and optionally stack level, the latter potentially more application specific when relevant,
(3) development of models related to degradation mechanisms, implementing models describing degradation mechanisms into performance models. Evaluation of the capability of performance/degradation models to confirm and quantify the accelerating impact by adapting some operating or load profiles should be considered.
A key requisite for the project is the certainty of acquisition of at least 6 aged samples of a given stack component (MEA for PEMFC or cell for SOFC, bipolar plate) of at least 3 different stacks and of the corresponding user profiles. Projects are open to any application (transport or stationary) and should focus on a fuel cell technology (PEMFC, SOFC). Therefore the relevant actors should be included in the consortium and/or letters of intent of the materials providers should be provided. Availability of comparable non aged materials or stack components should be envisioned to ensure relevant comparison between “real-world” ageing and ageing caused by selected AST.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
A collaboration mechanism needs to be developed with the JRC, in relation to the ongoing EU protocols harmonization and validation activities performed in support to the whole FCH2 JU program.
International collaboration through scientific exchanges or an advisory board with entities outside Europe (e.g. IPHE countries) investigating this field is highly recommended in so far proposals include a specific activity to frame and justify their work and its contribution within the international activity.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
Enhanced understanding of the correlation between user profile and degradation mechanisms on at least two stack components (gas diffusion layer, catalyst layer , membrane for PEMFC, cell for SOFC, bipolar plate and potentially its sealing) and its validation with models related to degradation mechanisms
Define updated testing hardware for PEMFC, testing methods and evaluation criterion / criteria to allow faster evaluation than current AST of new materials and standardised tests to benchmark materials on at least two stack components (gas diffusion layer, catalyst, membrane for PEMFC, cell for SOFC, , bipolar plate) with a quantified correlation or between AST results and lifetime in a user profile (transport, stationary)
Validation of the methodology (i.e. comparison and correlation between “real-world” behaviour and AST caused degradation) should be achieved owing to experimental and/or modelling results showing at least similar ranking between materials or stack components with a good correlation between quandtitative degradation features (to be selected such as performaces degradation rates, properties losses, microstucture modifications)
Provide recommendations about improvements of monitoring and tracking systems for future deployments in order to capitalise on return of experience.
Integration of the developed AST with the EU harmonized test protocols (for PEMFC). Final document with reference to existing global SoA AST, explaining differences and additional valuable information.
Recommendations for international standardisation of Accelerated Stress Testings within IEC TC105 which should lead to a New Working Item Proposal (NWIP)

Education and training in the fuel cells and hydrogen sector is critical for the current and future workforce and thereby supports indirectly the commercialisation of the technology. Knowledgeable and capable workforce that understands the functioning of both technology and underlying fundamental processes, but knows also about obstacles and technological restrictions, is essential for successful development, planning and implementation of FCH plant and system technology. Apart from conventional education and training methods, education and training on FCH technology and its fundamental processes should turn towards digital based e-education and e-training methods, which become more and more used fruitful and successful in modern education methods. In addition, e-science practised by modelling and simulation of very different technological problems and issues is increasing over the past years and knowledge, and results originated by modelling and simulation are available via digital means and should be transferred to be used for education and training on FCH technologies. An envisaged challenge is the presentation of conventional technological content through modern information technology concepts, serviceable for higher education (undergraduate and graduate students) in case of educating engineers but also focusing on industry, especially SMEs, to educate and train permanent employees, or by self-study through new e-education methods and concepts.

Specific challenge: Many hydrogen-energy systems such as electrolysers, fuel cell backup systems, refuelling stations, etc. are commonly designed and integrated into containers and/or small enclosures. Such hydrogen products usually comprise high-pressure piping, fittings and components that, in case of failure in such confined and obstructed enclosures, may lead to the rapid formation of a turbulent flammable hydrogen-air mixture. If ignited, such cloud would trigger a deflagration or even a more devastating detonation. This event requires a specific attention where best to apply safety barriers to mitigate the risk from a hydrogen explosion in order to ensure the highest level of safety for hydrogen energy applications.
Explosion venting technique is commonly used in the industry to both mitigate explosion overpressure effects in the surroundings and prevent complete facility destruction and missile effects. Being able to correctly design an effective vent is an essential safety feature for fast-deploying containerized hydrogen-energy products.
Nonetheless, the European standard EN 14994 “Gas explosion venting protective systems” has a very limited range of applicability and can hardly be used for vent sizing of hydrogen-air deflagrations. Despite more recent hydrogen-air vented deflagration experiments available in the safety community, only few data are representative of real-life conditions that can be encountered in hydrogen-energy containers or enclosures. Recent work related to engineering correlations for vent sizing was carried out but still need further development to be straightforwardly applicable to hydrogen-energy enclosures.
Performing experiments in real-life industrial enclosures is thus necessary to improve vent sizing techniques for hydrogen-energy products and further develop analytic and CFD modelling tools. The experiments will have to be representative of different possible scenario/ potential hazards identified in enclosures. This includes in particular the characterisation of venting systems (e.g. doors, natural vent openings, etc.) for combustion of homogeneous hydrogen-air mixtures at different concentrations, formation and combustion of gradient mixtures, delayed ignition of turbulent hydrogen jet inside containers and enclosures, etc…
Another knowledge gap is the structural response of containers exposed to a vented explosion. The overpressure – impulse (P-I) diagram has to be modelled theoretically. Mechanical response experiments should also be performed to check the model and its assumptions.
Scope:  Conduct pre-normative research on hydrogen-air vented deflagrations in real-scale containers to prepare an International Standard on “hydrogen explosion venting mitigation systems”
Expected impact:
•             Coordinated input to an International Standard on “hydrogen explosion venting mitigation systems”
•             Safe and successful introduction of hydrogen-energy systems into the market by definition of harmonised and standardised hydrogen vent sizing requirements for installations in enclosures
•             Prediction of hydrogen explosion effects for certification and planning purposes by developing, verifying and validating analytical and CFD predictive models

There has been considerable overall progress with fuel cell and hydrogen (FCH) technology development and market deployment in the past. To keep this trend successful and to foster on further market entry, it is essential that the safety of all FCH technologies and plant can be assured – particularly as public and end-user acceptance depends on actual and perceived safety levels. Today's FCH technology comprise many different techniques and components and the safety coefficient of each FCH component affects the overall safety coefficient of each assembled plant and packaged system. Best practice guidelines are therefore required on current and emerging FCH Technologies including information at the component level and, if relevant, the weakest component(s) in the assembled system for which definition of fail-safe modes and/or restrictions on use might reasonably apply during early deployment and pre-commercialisation stages of the applicable FCH technology.
Scope:
For the further successful deployment and market entry of FCH technologies is essential to ensure the safe operation of FCH applications. Contemporary FCH technology is based on integrating and assembling a mix of technical components, e.g. electrolysers, finishing devices, storage tanks, fuel cell stacks, sensors, etc. depending on the particular application the system is intended for. Each of the components bears its own critical failure aspects and safety standard. The overall safety standard of an assembly can be increased through improving safety coefficients of individual components within the assembly. The improvement of safety coefficient in general supports both the safe and harmless operation of FCH technology together with plant endurance.
Apart from safety coefficient of single components, the best practice in assembling and installing components to extensive plants is as well essential and should be based on known practical issues and safety standards. The accumulated knowledge base concerning past failures for the installation, for the operation and for the maintenance of the specific FCH technology can influence and complete best practice guidelines.
It is expected that the consortium would create comprehensible and specific best practice guidelines based on already identified practical issues arising from all kind of FCH industry including knowledge transfer of past and ongoing projects and specific research results facing that issue:
Best practice guidelines based on already identified practical issues
Implementation of new standard operating procedures and safety standards as far as available
Implementation of restrictions according the assembly of materials, components and interfaces
General procedures in order to define the best compromise of cost-reduction, safety and industrialization
Identification of further requirements to technical components common to both the energy and transport sectors
Expected Impact:
Increase fail-safer of several assembled plant technology
Raising public confidence in FCH Technologies
Improvement to the operation and maintenance of FCH plant technologies by best practice guidelines
Influences the necessities to standardization/harmonization of materials used, components, interfaces and testing procedures in order to define the best compromise of cost-reduction, industrialization and safety aspects

Specific challenge:
The availability of petabytes of on-line and off-line information being open to the public owned by the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA), such as police forces and/or custom authorities or the result of the investigation of a (cyber-) offence, represents a valuable resource but also a management challenge. Access to huge amounts of data, structured (data-bases), unstructured (multilingual text, multimedia), semi-structured (HTML, XML, etc.), heterogeneous data collected by LEA sensors such as Video, Audio, GSM and GPS, all possibly obfuscated or anonymized, available locally or over private LEA owned/shared networks or over the Internet, can easily result in an information overload and represent a problem instead of a useful asset.
Scope:
Proposals under this topic should aim to provide solutions at and beyond the state-of-the-art in the areas of intelligent use and management of complex and large amount of data for the discovery of correlated evidences to support forensic investigation on one hand and for the operational and situational awareness of law enforcement agencies on the other. The problem of extracting, integrating, exchanging ,analysing and exploiting large complex, structured and unstructured (Natural Language Text, SMS, multimedia) heterogeneous data, as well as that of exploiting unstructured data (Natural Language Text, SMS) and adding intelligence (trends analysis, scenarios, etc.), has to be solved by means of at and beyond state-of-the-art technologies in the areas of Big Data, Data Analytics, Multimedia Analysis, Data Modelling, Data mining, Visualization, Intelligent User's Interfaces, Information Retrieval, Automatic Language Translation, Weak Signal Analysis, Ontologies, High Level Fusion Techniques for Context Awareness and Knowledge Representation. Digital intelligence capabilities should also enable smart pre-processing and filtering of sensor data and stored data in order to improve their reliability, accuracy, accessibility and transmission volume.
The scope of this topic is threefold:
Firstly, tools and platforms should be developed for sampling, analysing, evaluating, interpreting, reasoning over, and recording forensic evidence from big data with a view to achieve solid and court-proof forensic evidence that can be used during legal prosecution. Applications should provide certainty with respect to the time and location of multimedia content and tests for authenticity and integrity of digital identities. Platforms should also provide users with semi-interactive techniques for understanding and visualizing data, including interdisciplinary approaches based on common, possibly standardized, ontologies and the exploitation of automated reasoning, information retrieval, and filtering tools. Human and organisational factors like multilingualism/multiculturalism as well as other trans-border issues (different terminologies, legislations, procedures) must be properly addressed.
Secondly, tools and platforms should be developed to enable LEAs to store, process, analyse, share, and exchange large amounts of heterogeneous data, including data arising from various types of sensors, with the aim of improving operational and situational awareness more efficiently. Data exchange between LEA and network operators shall be standardized for fast and efficient processing. These should include applications which can provide early warning signs (e.g. predictions of future trends). Vendor locking has to be excluded. The development of a base line system for current and future end users should also be envisaged and the solution should follow Open Source concepts. This will enable transparency, and continuous maintenance and development after the end of the project. The software should provide fine-grained authorisation mechanisms to regulate data access. Support for logging and in general maintain the chain of custody is also required.
Thirdly, tools and platform should allow reaching a significant speed-up in the whole process of analysing (cyber) offenses. The main challenges are the automation of as many analysis steps as possible; the countering of the obfuscation used by the attacker. The finding of an efficient way to identify an attacker despite use of anonymisation, , performing automatic deep analysis of all data in the offense, and making optimal use of the capabilities of man and machine.
Proposals addressing this topic should address the three aspects of the scope and take previous research at European and national level into account. Methodologies, standards, expertise and procedures for training, simulation, and testing investigations to empower the experts and stream-line the processes involved in the fusion, exchange and analysis of big data for forensic investigation and operational/situational awareness for law enforcement purposes should be considered.
The proposal will have to deal with the management of personal data, and related ethical and legal issues. Therefore considerable attention will have to be given to privacy and data protection, and to the adherence to European regulations. For each proposed solution, potential issues vis-à-vis these rights and regulations will have to be analysed, and recommendations on the best solutions to these issues must be proposed.
Proposals addressing this topic may involve the use of classified background information (EU or national) or the production of security sensitive results. As such, certain project deliverables may require security classification. The final decision on the classification of projects is subject to the security evaluation.
Proposals for this topic should take into account the existing EU and national projects in this field.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €9m and €12m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development from Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6 or above; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Expected impact:
Proposals should lead to:
improved capabilities for the LEA to conduct investigations and analysis;
higher efficiency in accessing relevant data sources and retrieving information significant for forensic investigation; and
improved capabilities for trans-border LEA data-exchange and collaboration.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development from Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6 or above; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Specific challenge:
In the event of an accident or a terrorist attack (including those involving CBRNE materials), the physical examination of the crime scene by hand may not be possible, or could be severly restricted due to the presence of hazardous material or risk of building collapse. Therefore, there is a need for the development of mobile, remotely- controlled technologies to enable an improved identification/detection of CBRNE materials and collection of forensic material / evidence in a variety of situations and conditions.
Scope:
The proposal should focus on the “mobile, remotely controlled” characteristics of the technologies to be developed to enable the assessment of hazardous scenes where the deployment of personnel is difficult as a result of an accident or terrorist attack. This should include technologies to enable the verification of CBRNE materials through the identification / detection (including visual recognition) of the type of substance and the collection of forensic material / evidence. The output should be operational in a variety of weather and terrain conditions, and demonstrate that they are cost effective. Proposals should link with existing projects. Tools/technologies should have a minimal disruptive effect on the crime scene.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going work within the European Framework Cooperation (EFC) should be taken into account.
Tools developed need to be available to law enforcement agencies at a fair price.

Improved remotely controlled identification / detection and collection of forensic evidence in case of accidents or terrorist attacks involving CBRNE materials. Higher cost effectiveness of CBRNE forensics. For industry, better understanding of modern operational CBRNE identification/ detection requirements, thus increasing the competitiveness of their mobile equipments and products.

Specific challenge:
Investigations on the activities of criminal organizations  usually require Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) to use electronic equipment for legal recording, retrieving and monitoring of criminal activities in a safe and unnoticed way, while keeping for both the sensors part and the monitoring station all the legal, integrity and chain-of-custody requirements that will enable the presentation of evidences obtained this way at the Courts of Justice.
Requirements for this equipment are very different from those offered by available commercial devices. Depending on the operation, the periods of time that these electronic devices have to work can range from days to months or in real time. Access to the device could be limited or impossible. Secure remote operation over radio channel (or other type of communication channel, including GSM networks)  should be possible. Other requirement may apply like small size for easy concealment, low power consumption for extended time life, robustness and self- protection in addition to strong authentication mechanisms for operators and protection of the communication channels.
Scope:
The task is to develop a new type of sensors and equipments, monitoring station and their associated communication channel for LEA operation on the field according to their specification and subject to their validation at the end of the project taking into account the societal acceptance of the proposed solutions. Participation of LEAs and experts in fundamental rights in the definition of requirements and validation of results is essential, as only end-users are familiar with the challenges they frequently have to face in real operations within criminal investigations, and as experts on fundamental rights are informed on the impact of new technologies on individual lives (in particular privacy) and which rules should consequently be respected.

Specific challenge:
Due to the ease of publishing information on the Internet (Web site, blogs, social networks, newsgroups, forums, etc.), terrorists increasingly exploit the Internet as a communication, intelligence, training, recruitment and propaganda tool where they can safely communicate with their affiliates, coordinate action plans, raise funds, and introduce new supporters or recruits into their networks. In order to cope with the dangers involved in the use of Internet by global terrorist organizations and grassroots terrorist cells, more efficient and effective automated techniques are required. Despite the often explicit (or at least not disguised) content of these web-sites, especially when used for propaganda, the huge amount of somehow related, yet not illegal, sites, represents a major obstacle to the reliable and fast analysis of their contents. Research should therefore develop and apply new and/or improved data and text and multimedia mining methods to detect, categorize, analyse, reason over, and summarize terrorist-generated content group information from several sources that supports same history, and isolate potential sources describing different ideas, that could be intended to generate “disinformation” or fake evidences to distract LEA from real scenarios. Aside this, modes of finding sources of data, capturing and preserving data for forensic analysis, authenticating images and linking videos and conversely proving multimedia data falsification, should be investigated.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on the accurate identification of terrorist online communities (even hiding their real identity), accurate and fast categorization of malicious content published by terrorists and their supporters in multiple languages, large-scale temporal analysis of terrorism trends, and real-time summarization of multilingual and multimedial information published by terrorists, including content filtering for mis- and disinformation and framing. In addition, linking pseudonyms and finding the original author should be part of the research. The developed methodologies should be able to handle massive amounts of multilingual and multimedial web content in minimal time.

Specific challenge: The challenge is to achieve, by 2020, the full range of technological capabilities needed for delivering a broad spectrum of extreme scale HPC systems. The designs of these systems need to respond to critical demands of energy efficiency, new delivery models, as well as to the requirements of new types of applications, including extreme-data applications. New methodologies, environments and tools for extremely-parallel and data-intensive programming are needed to achieve code quality and portability, reduce software development and maintenance costs while maximally exploiting underlying system capabilities (e.g., exploiting millions of cores in an energy-aware way). New mathematics and new algorithms are needed for ultra-scalable algorithms with predictable performance for existing or visionary applications, including data-intensive and extreme data applications in scientific areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, life sciences, materials, climate, geosciences, etc.
Scope: Proposals shall target one of the following subtopics:
a)             HPC core technologies and architectures, addressing one or more of the HPC core technologies (processors, memory, interconnect and storage) and their optimal integration into extreme scale HPC systems, platforms and prototypes. Proposals should have a co-design approach driven by ambitious applications and in close cooperation with the scientific disciplines and stakeholders concerned, aiming at radical overall system performance improvement while at the same time addressing issues such as: a holistic understanding of energy efficiency across the full HPC system architecture; I/O, storage and data-throughput capabilities especially for big-data applications; radical scalability, concurrency, locality and resilience in the presence of millions of cores. A minimum of 60% of the available budget for this topic will be allocated to research under this part.
b)             Programming methodologies, environments, languages and tools: development of new programming models, domain-specific languages, programming paradigms, visualisation and data-analysis tools to facilitate the effective exploitation of the full system capabilities (including energy management) of the emerging large- and extreme scale systems, in particular for extreme parallelism and extreme data applications.
c)             APIs and system software for future extreme scale systems: New APIs and the corresponding efficient, flexible and scalable exascale system software for managing extreme scale systems, taking into account extreme parallelism, extreme data, energy consumption and resilience. Proposals are expected to include communication and dissemination activities towards relevant standards bodies and research programmes. It is expected that proposals on this point have the critical mass, if necessary beyond Europe, to strategically coordinate the API work in the exascale stack.
d)            New mathematical and algorithmic approaches for existing or emerging applications on extreme scale systems. Work proposed should include energy-aware algorithms and maximally exploit the projected characteristics of exascale-class systems. Specific issues are quantification of uncertainty and noise, multiscale and extreme data. Software engineering for extreme parallelism should be addressed. Open source development is privileged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Under part a) of the scope also larger proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million can be envisaged. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Collaborations with Russian partners that can contribute outstanding scientific excellence in mathematics and algorithms for HPC is welcomed. These partners will however not be funded under this call.
Expected impact:
•                Contribution to the realisation of the ETP4HPC Strategic Research Agenda, thus strengthened European research and industrial leadership in HPC technologies.
•                Covering important segments of the broader and/or emerging HPC markets, especially extreme-scale HPC systems.
•                Impact on standards bodies and other relevant international research programmes and frameworks.

Specific challenge: For Europe's competitiveness in manufacturing, it is crucial that advances in ICT are taken up in engineering and manufacturing ""at large"" as soon as they have the appropriate maturity level.
Scope: As Phase 2[1] of I4MS this objective addresses the adoption of the next generation of ICT advances in the manufacturing domain. Focus is on emerging innovative technologies and processes, which need to be customised, integrated, tested and validated before being released on the market. Special emphasis is on strengthening European SMEs along the value chain by adopting new concepts and business models based on servitisation, for product operation, or for end-of-life use.
Two types of innovation experiments are supported: Driven by the requirements of first-time users, Application Experiments bring together all actors of the value chain and experts necessary to equip new users with novel products or services and assist them in customising and applying these in their respective environments. In Equipment Assessment Experiments, suppliers of innovative high-tech equipment install and assess their prototypes or products in production-like environments and validate them in a manufacturing line or in an industrial environment that is very close to manufacturing conditions.
Activities are expected to be clustered in larger projects to achieve critical mass and to better exploit EU-added value. Common tasks include: targeted dissemination; management of calls for new actions; exploitation of synergies across actions.
The action may involve financial support to third parties, in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers running the experiments for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50 000 – 150 000[2] per party). Maximum 50% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.
 a.      Three areas of technologies are targeted for the Innovation actions::
            Highly flexible and near-autonomous robotics systems (application experiments).
            HPC Cloud-based modelling, simulation and analytics services for modelling multiple interconnected phenomena; for integrating multiple tools across the process chain; for exploiting the dynamic availability of ""big data""; for integrating novel mobile interfaces for data management and decision support; for achieving real-time response (application experiments), and addressing comprehensively security and privacy issues at all levels.
            Integration of Cyber-Physical-System modules in manufacturing processes and process chains (application or assessment experiments) to increase sophistication and automation in production SMEs and to create novel value added services linked to process surveillance and maintenance.
For this topic, experiment descriptions should include an outline of the initial exploitation plan and business scenario, which will be developed further in the proposed experiment.
b.      Support actions: network of Innovation multipliers leveraging investment in research and innovation is to be reinforced:
To advance the European I4MS innovation ecosystem: The aim is to achieve broad coverage in technological, application, innovation, and geographic terms. Its tasks and services shall include maintaining a single innovation portal for newcomers; sharing of best practices and experiences; dissemination; brokering between users and suppliers in view of open calls; leveraging further investment by stimulating replication, by brokering access to venture capital or other private investment, and by exploiting regional funds in the context of the European strategy on ""Smart Specialisation"".
Expected impact:
            Attract a significant number of new users of advanced ICT in the manufacturing sector, in particular SMEs and the mid-caps.
            More innovative and competitive technology suppliers, in particular SMEs, both on the level of ICT and on the level of manufacturing equipment, able to supply manufacturers with new equipment, components, and tools for improved manufacturing and engineering operations.
            More competitive European service providers through provisioning of new types of services; through strengthening the presence on local markets.
            Exploration of new application areas for advanced ICT in manufacturing at large.
Types of action:
a.             Innovation Actions. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that a minimum of one innovation action is supported for each area of technologies.

Specific challenge:The manufacturing of customised products (e.g. consumer goods and medical devices) requires the development of new strategies integrating design with manufacturing and incorporating appropriate control methodologies to ensure small or large lot quantities which meet the specifications. Examples include new custom made parts or spare parts on demand either to sub-divisions of sectors/products or personalised to an individual as well as unique identification marking of products. New manufacturing processes and machines will need to be developed which are flexible at the local level to meet specific consumer demand and mass customisation where rapid translation between different specifications is required. In order to address customisation, advanced manufacturing processes(e.g. additive manufacturing or electrical discharge machining) need to enable processing of multi-materials, lightweight and high-strength materials or functionally graded materials, as well as more flexibility and rapid reconfiguring capabilities. For all customised manufacturing, it is necessary to have quick realisation from design to production in one process step as well as economic production systems down to single and small lot sizes. 
Scope: Research activities should be multi-disciplinary and address several of the following areas:
-          Development and integration of advanced design and manufacturing technologies able to transform such new product-service data descriptions and protocols into manufacturing operations and processes exploiting.
-          Development of new machines and processes integrating advanced materials for the manufacturing of personalised parts and products.
-          Seamless data integration across the process and supply chains for the fast production and distribution of custom made parts and products.
-          Methodologies and tools for the management and running of effective value chains for the fast production and delivery of personalised products.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 4-6. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capabilities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Increased capability to provide value added products/services and to rapidly follow the market dynamics by means of fast production and delivery of customised parts and products.
                Reduction by 50% in the lead-time for manufacturing one new custom part with respect to current values for same requirements.
                Cost reduction of personalised products manufacturing by 20%, by decreasing lead times in products and processes development and the time to market of customised parts and products by 30%.

Specific challenge: Easy and fast reconfigurable machinery and robots are essential to answer to the increasing need for highly complex products and to react to rapid changes in market demands. Smaller lot sizes and more product variations require a highly flexible production capacity. New tools are required to support more rapid and autonomous reconfiguration of production systems. Powerful tools addressing self-adjustment, correction, and control of individual machines and robots, the production system as a whole and the link with existing production planning and scheduling systems have been developed over recent years but integration and deployment of those tools require further R&D and demonstration. While the focus will be on demonstrating the tools on existing production capacity, R&D activities supporting the integration and scale-up are expected as well.
Scope: Demonstration activities should address all of the following areas:
-                      Integrated tools for the management of agile production systems as a whole (Manufacturing Execution Systems) and the fast reconfigurable individual machines and robots, optimising the changeover times and costs.
-                      Standardisation of the communication protocols and data structures fitting the plug and produce philosophy.
-                      Protocols for interconnecting the production system information with higher level plant management systems.
-                      Integration of automatic monitoring and optimisation of energy usage in the production system.
-                      Demonstration of the integrated solution in at least one existing production environment.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
 Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capabilities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Enabling existing production systems to produce on average at least 50% smaller lot sizes and 50% more product variations in an economical way, as a result production will be demand driven and waste will be significantly reduced.
                Reduction of at least 30% of the set-up and changeover times and costs for existing production systems leading to a significant increase in production capacity.
                Reduction of average energy consumption by 5% through an optimised use of production capacity.
                Strong support for standardisation of communication protocols, data structures and tool connectivity.

Specific challenge: Simulating continuous and discrete manufacturing processes, forecasting the behaviour of manufacturing systems and processes, and designing products to an even larger extent through virtual mock-ups and optimization methods integrated in the design and production chain are key enablers for Europe's future manufacturing sector. Advances in ICT in terms of high performance computing power and communication speed, smart sensor technologies for generating and exploiting ""big data"", the convergence of the embedded world and the Internet/Cloud world in cyber physical systems (CPS), multi-modal visualisation and interaction technologies, are leading to a new generation of modelling, simulation, forecasting and decision support methods and tools. These offer a huge potential for making the whole manufacturing chain more competitive.
Scope:
a.      R&I Actions: proposals are expected to cover at least one of the two themes identified below.
Innovative modelling, simulation, analytics and forecasting tools for manufacturing at large, building on advances in ICT. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should be driven by industrial use-cases and should include proof-of-concept demonstrations for validation, preferably on real process chains. They should address as appropriate several of the following issues:
               Modelling and simulation methods involving multiple phenomena (physical, mechanical, energetic, chemical, energy, material characteristics, cost, …); including multi-scale and integrated discrete/continuous models, multidisciplinary and multiobjective design optimisation tools taking a holistic approach; and/or integrating virtual and physical experiments building on the combination of simulated, experimental, and real world data in real time.
               Integrated knowledge-based systems covering the complete product life-cycle with advanced analytics, smart decision support systems and self-learning capabilities exploiting the availability of ""big data"" from smart sensors, historical process files, or human-authored data; and addressing aspects, e. g. interactivity, real-time, data-fusion, imprecise computing, compressed sensing, advanced visualisation, security and privacy.
Integrated modelling, simulation and information management systems benefiting from recent advances in ICT. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects are expected to stimulate pre-normative or standardisation activities related to aspects such as information/knowledge exchange, data sharing, semantic technologies, tool integration, etc. Projects must include reference implementations and demonstration and validation in minimum two comprehensive and complementary industrial use cases. Focus is on at least one of the following issues:
               Integrated information management systems for product-process-production systems that are well embedded into their social, environmental and economic context.
             Advanced computer aided technologies (CAx), modelling, simulation and decision support toolboxes tailored for novel manufacturing processes, e. g. laser-based and additive manufacturing.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation plan and business scenario, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
 b.       Support Actions: Road mapping and constituency building for novel ICT-enabled concepts in manufacturing supporting the wide adoption of virtual, integrated, scalable, semantic factory models; merging design and production models; and integrating novel ICT for creativity. Stimulating EU-US collaboration on R&I related to modelling and simulation.
Expected impact:
            Increased productivity during design and ramp-up phases and for higher mass customization capacity for big enterprises as well as SMEs through access to on-demand scalable manufacturing process chains and services and through agreed data standards.
            Improved cost efficiency and accuracy, reliability and speed of simulation techniques for manufacturing processes and/or full complex products.
            Reduced time to production and optimised supply chains enabled by increased tool interoperability and data integration.
            Enhanced interoperability of integrated product and factory design systems and global state monitoring enabling new type of services related to the data analysis, simulations and visualization techniques in each manufacturing stage.

Specific challenge: European society and industry are facing new challenges, requiring more innovation, productivity and competitiveness, whilst using fewer resources and reducing environmental impact. GNSS offers various possibilities for the development of new space enabled applications, which will enhance Europe's capacity to address major societal challenges in focus areas such as health, citizen safety, mobility, smart cities, sustainable resources monitoring and management, regional growth, low-carbon energy infrastructure planning and protection, disaster management and climate action including natural catastrophes.
Satellite navigation provides continuous, real-time, reliable, accurate and globally available position, velocity and time. The technology fits important societal and market needs.
Scope: Proposals should aim at developing new innovative applications, with future commercial impact. The topic addresses application development in all market segments, such as: transport (road, rail, maritime, aviation), high precision surveying, location based services (LBS),  agriculture, emergency services etc responding to user requirements. Application development should be seen in a broad context - it includes the development, adaptation and/or integration of new software, hardware, services, datasets, etc.  The use of EGNOS and Galileo Early Services is a key priority for this topic.
Research and innovation activities within this topic should take into consideration possibility of:
1.      Exploitation of synergies with other space-based services and systems in order to enable multi-use character of EGNOS and Galileo-enabled applications in all market segments,
2.      Exploitation of the distinguishing features of EGNOS and Galileo signals and operational advantages in downstream applications,
3.      Preparation for the use of early services, ensuring a greater precision and availability of signals,
4.      Implementation of pilot projects for further development of EGNSS based applications,
5.      Standardisation, certification, legal and societal acceptance, which will foster EGNSS adoption.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Activities should promote innovation in order to maximise the potential of the European GNSS and its adoption. They should demonstrate a clear advantage of using Galileo and EGNOS and include synergies with other GNSS. Proposals should aim at the definition and implementation of pilot projects and development of the EGNSS-enabled applications that are close to the market and driven by user requirements with a high societal benefit and a potential to eventually set common standards in the field of GNSS applications. The proposal should have a clear intention and rationale to commercialise the products and services developed, including a business plan.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Transport is fundamental to our economy and society. An efficient and sustainable mobility is vital for the internal market and for the quality of life of the citizens. Transport enables economic growth and job creation. Satellite navigation application technology is an increasingly common component of modern transport systems. It contributes to a competitive, safe and resource efficient transport system and enables new challenging solutions in terms of positioning and navigation performances in aviation, road, maritime and rail, as well as in multi-modal applications. The use of EGNSS is also a key factor in many EU transport related policies, such as Intelligent Transport System, emergency call (eCall), enhanced digital tachograph, European Single Sky, European contribution to the Worldwide Maritime Radionavigation System.
The specific challenge of this topic is to develop innovative EGNSS based applications in aviation, road, maritime and rail that will make EGNOS and Galileo more available to transport users and enable new end-to-end solutions that require accurate and resilient positioning and navigation.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at developing new innovative applications, with commercial impact and a clear market uptake perspective. Innovation activities within this topic should build on:
Exploitation of the distinguishing features of EGNOS and Galileo signals and operational advantages in downstream applications;
Implementation of EGNSS based pilot projects and end-to-end solutions, ready for use by the private or public sector;
Standards, certification, legal and societal acceptance, which will foster EGNSS adoption; and
Exploitation of synergies with other positioning and navigation systems and techniques, with focus in valorising EGNOS and Galileo in the frame of multi-constellation and multi-frequency environment.
EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies is required to make the application(s) work, this is not excluded from the scope. Proposals may be submitted in any of the following four transport domains:
Aviation: The development of EGNSS solutions for navigation, surveillance and communication in all phases of flight (aircraft and rotorcraft) should be addressed, including the possibility to determine the location of aircraft in distress. In particular, GNSS based PBN (Performance Based Operations), advanced operations for approach and landing benefitting from robust vertical guidance and LPV-200/CAT1 services[1]. Furthermore, surveillance applications, such as ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) and use of reliable PVT for signal integrity, precise positioning and orientation of remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) might be addressed. Synergy and complementarity with the Sesar Joint Undertaking and other initiatives shall be clearly identified. Proposals should in particular build on multi-constellation/multi-frequency, current and future EGNOS integrity features and service levels, as well as integration of multi-constellation enabling capabilities.
Road: Development of EGNSS solutions in emerging innovative domains, such as autonomous vehicles, that are safety critical and require a specific accurate and resilient positioning, timing and navigation should be addressed. Development of EGNSS solutions in policy driven applications, such as new generation of eCall, enhanced digital tachograph, dangerous goods transport, etc. might also be addressed. Proposals should in particular build on Galileo specific signal features and differentiators and new services such as authentication and high precision, as well as current and future EGNOS integrity features.
Maritime: Development of EGNSS based solutions in the different maritime and inland waterways (including the Arctic), such as vessels navigation, traffic management and surveillance, search and rescue, port operations, custom fraud control, fisheries monitoring should be addressed. Proposals should in particular build on the use of current and future EGNOS dedicated services for maritime, and the Search and Rescue service of Galileo, other Galileo differentiating features and services, such as authentication, and high precision.
Rail: Development of EGNSS based solutions in train signalling and control, contributing to the evolution and cost competitiveness of the European Rail Traffic Management System, and in non-safety-critical applications, such as passenger information system, asset management, etc. should be addressed. Synergy and complementarity with the Shift 2 Rail Joint Undertaking and other initiatives shall be clearly identified. Proposals should in particular build on the current and future EGNOS integrity services and multi-constellation, multi-frequency, and specific signal features of Galileo that improves position performances in the challenging railway environment (e.g. urban parts).
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities should promote innovation in order to maximise the potential of the EGNSS and its adoption in transport. They should build on specific features and differentiators of Galileo and EGNOS, demonstrating the advantage of their use in transport. The applications shall contribute to the modern, efficient and user-friendly transport system. The activities should be complemented with a systems’ approach, taking care of infrastructure and regulatory requirements, coordination of multiple actors and pilot projects to encourage market take-up.
The proposals shall have a clear intention and rationale to commercialise the products and services developed, including a business plan.

Specific challenge:Production quality significantly depends on the ambient conditions and the process parameters. Computational models capable of simulating the machine-to-part process not only can be used to predict manufacturing quality and productivity but, increasingly, to also compensate wear or partial damage through model-based control. Innovative machines and processes increasingly depend on model-based approaches, including the monitoring and control elements, throughout the whole machine lifecycle.
New integrated approaches are needed in simulation methods, tools and across hierarchical model layers requiring a cross-disciplinary collaboration between (predominantly SME) machine designers, industrial component suppliers, engineering software developers as well as making use of the process experience of manufacturers.
Scope: RTD and innovation activities should aim at developing and testing suitable model-based approaches for production machinery and at demonstrating the power of model-driven approaches for machine innovation through:
-          The development of integrated and accurate simulation models and algorithms for model-based control of production machinery based on cross-disciplinary input and actual machine lifecycle parameters.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Multi-material design of components and structures provides an opportunity to develop products which are able to operate under more exigent requests demanded by market and society such as increased strength-to-weight ratio, multi-functionality, highly aggressive environments and low carbon footprint. By smart use of adequate joining technologies, and the incorporation of multi-material design into the assembly chain, the final product performance can be improved. This is particularly relevant when high cost, scarce or hazardous materials are involved.
Scope: Traditional joining leads to loss of the performance that materials offer in their final product, because of modifications in composition and properties or geometric distortion. Improved, new or hybrid joining and assembly processes are therefore needed to be developed for specific combinations of designs and materials, in combination with flexible and automated non-destructive inspection technologies, in order to overcome the mentioned limitations. Technologies to be addressed can be welding processes, bonding using adhesives, mechanical joining or any other joining process. The novel joining integration capabilities will feature a high degree of process automation and quality control and they will make use of sustainable manufacturing practises. Assembly and disassembly efficiency, product quality, recycling and cost targets will also be considered. While the focus will be on demonstrating the technologies, R&D activities supporting the integration and scale-up are expected as well.
Demonstration activities should focus on all of the following priorities:
-                      Joining and assembly processes that will lead to improved performance of the joints for real operating conditions, and facilitate recycling, based on a deep understanding of the cause-effect relationships as well as of materials process interactions.
-                      The implementation of numerical simulation techniques, including computational multi-scale modelling, which will lead to a better understanding of the considered joining processes as well as product development along all its different phases.
-                      The development of high efficient, cost-effective and flexible surface condition solutions (e.g. surface modification, thermal treatments, gap avoidance) to provide joints with the maximum performance.
-                      The implementation and set up of reliable, efficient and automated non-destructive inspection techniques for joint quality evaluation, together with in-situ monitoring and control systems for critical variables of the joining operations that will guarantee reliable, robust and safe production conditions in industrial environments.
At least one prototype or pilot implementation in pre-industrial settings aiming at demonstrating the scalability should be delivered before the end of the project as a proof of concept.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1].  The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capabilities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Application of multi-material design to products through the developed joining and assembly processes will bring:
                At least 20% decrease in the consumption of high cost and critical materials.
                At least 30% improvement of the product performance, without increasing the final price.
                A higher level of automation and lower production times compared to current technologies.

Specific challenge:In order to increase the competitiveness of EU industry and reduce the environmental footprint, manufacturing industries should develop innovative technologies and approaches to manufacture added-value products with fewer resources and to ensure a sustainable product life cycle based on reuse and re-manufacturing methods and technologies.
Innovative product recovery approaches would need to be developed in order to extract useful components from obsolete or malfunctioning modules, to re-use useful functions and/or materials for new products or to extend their lifespan. This will help save time, money, energy, and resources.
Modern high-tech products adopted in the electronics, medical, energy and transport industries are made of advanced materials that are at present poorly recovered and reused. Such materials with low substitutability and low recycling rates include advanced materials such as long and short fibre composites, nano-materials and bio-materials as well as more conventional materials that are today not considered for re-use due to absence of data on reprocessed performance.
This unsustainable scenario requires systemic solutions which are involving all relevant actors in the supply chain. On the one side, there is the need for new product design approaches (including end-of-life options, re-use and re-manufacturing aspects) with development of the built-in product ‘smartness’ (for ageing monitoring) and modularity (for improved reuse). On the other side, new re-/de-manufacturing processes with improved resource efficiency, or processes more tolerant to substitute materials are required.
Scope: Research activities should be multi-disciplinary and address all of the following areas:
-          Eco-innovative approaches for product design which are capable to take into account re-use and re-manufacturing aspects for enhanced product recovery and spare parts/services support.
-          New manufacturing and equipment concepts for re-use and re-manufacturing, with improved resource efficiency and service lifetime.
-          New technologies and automation solutions for the effective disassembly/separation and recovery of advanced materials.
-          Generation and validation of new business models to improve economic viability of closed-loop life cycles which make use of the systemic approaches for product life-cycle management.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4-6.
This topic is particularly suitable for collaboration at international level, particularly under the IMS scheme.[1] Project partnerships that include independent organisations from IMS regions[2] are therefore encouraged. For a project to get the IMS label it must include independent organisations from at least two different IMS regions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
The impact on the areas of application of the projects is expected to be:
                A significant reduction of energy consumption in manufacturing activities by 2020.
                A significant reduction in non-renewable materials through a combination of substitution, reuse, remanufacture and recycling of materials.
                Reduction of minimum 20% in greenhouse gases emissions from manufacturing activities.
                Reduction of waste generation by 10% minimum.
                Enabling the manufacturing of eco-products.

Specific challenge: The limited driving range of electric vehicles is one of the biggest deployment challenges for electromobility. A ground-up re-design is needed to fully take advantage of the design freedoms and the opportunities in defining and developing the electric and electronic architecture and components. This should result in increased efficiency and range and make a major contribution towards the transition to fully electric vehicles (FEV's).
A particularly important element that needs to be addressed is the battery management system (BMS), which is fundamental for many aspects of electrified vehicle performance, from energy efficiency (and therefore range) to safety, battery life and reliability.
Information and communication technologies (ICT) significantly contribute to enhancing the energy efficiency and thus the range of the vehicle by providing accurate prediction of the range and offering personalised options and services to the driver. Furthermore ICT supports recharging that is coordinated with the local electric grid capabilities. Such coordination must accommodate not only passenger EVs, but also meet the requirements of electric buses, vans or trucks, which are expected to require high-powered fast recharging.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following complementing domains and could include interfaces between these domains:
      EV concepts featuring a complete revision of the electric and electronic architecture to reduce complexity and the number of components and interconnections, whilst improving energy efficiency, functionality and modularity. This may be supported by drive-by-wire or wireless communication, as well as advanced energy storage, transmission and conversion systems including miniaturisation. Challenges in safety, security, reliability and robustness, including electro-magnetic compatibility, are to be addressed. Work shall pursue a high degree of standardisation and cover the entire electric vehicle value chain.
      Concerning BMS research work will focus on a combination of the following aspects:
–      Novel BMS designs with improved thermal management, power density and life time, safety and reliability.
–      Improved modelling and simulation tools for BMS improvement.
–      Contribution to standardisation of BMS components and interfaces.
–      Test methodologies and procedures to evaluate the functional safety, reliability and lifetime of battery systems.
      Integration of the overall cycle of EV energy management into a comprehensive EV battery and ICT-based re-charging system management, providing ergonomic and seamless user support. Such integration should build upon existing technology standards and may address:
–      Digital support for EVs such as common information model, market place interaction and service provision based on wireless / power line communication interfaces, roaming management, energy consumption and supply as well as cost.
–      Interoperability of EVs with the communication infrastructure and electricity grid regarding locally deployed smart-grid and smart-metering systems while investigating arising operational issues.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals will have to contribute to the expected impacts listed below whenever relevant for the selected domain:
      Improvements in the cost-performance ratio of EV contributing to quicker market take-up.
      Enhancements to vehicle range and/or weight, battery life and reliability without compromising on safety - delivering a more robust and well managed battery system.
      Standardised BMS components and interfaces.
      Progress on ICT-based technologies for coordinated EV recharging.
      Improved attractiveness of EVs, achieved through a seamless and ergonomic energy management cycle (spanning the entire cycle from re-charging spot selection/reservation to plug-out after re-charging).
      Contributions to standardisation strengthening the competiveness of the European industry.

The European Commission adopted on 01 April 2019 the work programme for 2019 and the financing of Pilot Projects and Preparatory Actions in the field of ""Communications Networks, Content and Technology"" (C(2019) 2233 final).
The Communication ‘Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture', the Commission’s contribution to the EU Leader's Agenda discussion on education and culture at the Gothenburg Summit, sets out a vision for a European Education Area and announced a dedicated Digital Education Action Plan.
Closing the gender gap through digital and entrepreneurship education is one of the actions under the second priority of the Digital Education Action Plan: Developing relevant digital competences and skills for the digital transformation, and is vital if Europe is to fully embrace the benefits of the digital revolution. While both girls and boys have similar levels of interest and competence in digital technologies, fewer girls go on to develop this interest in their studies or for their career. Girls and young women require positive examples, role models and support to overcome stereotypes and realise that they too can embark on a fulfilling and successful career in ICT and STEM. Increasing female participation in these careers will help unleash Europe’s digital potential and ensure that women take an equal place in shaping the digital world. In the EU fewer than one in five ICT professionals are female.
Objectives
The aim of this action is to promote and teach Science, Engineering, Technology and Maths subjects (STEM) to girls in attractive and engaging ways, with a view to addressing the ongoing skills gap in the STEM sectors within the EU and especially the shortfall of women & increasing STEM drop-out rates of girls.
The underlying rationale is also to empower girls to learn and encourage them to become leaders in tech.
This aim is going to be achieved through a two-fold action.
Firstly, a network of schools, universities, high education institutions and companies will be set up. It will serve as a platform to support the advancement of girls in STEM education and careers, to exchange best practices and to raise awareness of girls all over Europe concerning the full spectrum of education and training options.
Secondly, no-cost summer camps for 13-18 year-old girls (typically 1 or 2 weeks long) will be designed to introduce middle and high school girls to a broad range of STEM subjects, in particular software engineering principles and programming languages. The experiences and insights collected in the course of the summer camps and other actions will be used by the network to provide recommendations and a set of ready-to-use guidelines available for reproduction of the events at local level.
Expected results
The network between schools, universities, companies will result in:
across Europe, consolidation of the actors who have an interest in more girls in STEM;
consolidation and dissemination of best practice strategies to involve more girls in STEM;
raised societal awareness of the need to attract more girls to STEM.
The summer program will reach all EU countries, serving 1,000+ middle and high school girls, many of whom come from under-represented backgrounds and will result in:
fewer stereotypes among girls when choosing their secondary education and/or career and interest in new professional profiles;
increased interest of girls in science, technology, engineering and maths;
engagement with STEM and learning to code;
strengthened abilities, boosted confidence and empowerment of girls to achieve success in STEM studies and career."

Specific challenge: The competitiveness of European road vehicle manufacturers is based on technological leadership particularly on system optimisation and affordability, particularly with respect to powertrains. The challenge is to recover a leading position in hybrid technology. The technology will also have positive effect on the reduction of CO2 emissions from road transport and air quality.
Scope: Proposals should develop new knowledge on hybrid components (storage system power electronics, etc.) and system engineering, simulation and technology integration with the aim of achieving hybrid powertrain weight and cost reduction, increased functionality, simplification of complex systems, efficiency and affordability while decreasing emissions and improving performance, comfort and functional safety. For light vehicles, preference would be given to concepts providing significant zero emission ranges. The research should be validated through at least one demonstrator for each platform subject of research.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 to 20 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The research will achieve a 20% powertrain efficiency improvement and a 20% powertrain weight and volume reduction with respect to the best in-class full hybrid vehicles on the market in 2013, while having a maximum 10% cost premium on the conventional model on which the demonstrator is based. To meet air quality targets, the research will prove, by independent testing real driving emissions at least below upcoming Euro 6 or Euro VI limits respectively. The research for light vehicles will develop technologies needed to progress towards the establishment of a future ‘Super Low Emission Vehicles’ standard with emission targets which are ambitiously lower than Euro 6.

","24 June 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Reducing real driving emissions and consumption of heavy duty road haulage is one of the main societal challenges for the sector. Fuel efficiency and emissions reduction are sometimes dependent on how they interact with each other and with the specific vehicle application and operating conditions. The challenge is therefore to develop new means of flexible and global engine and emissions control in an optimal way for each application in order to maximise the potential utilisation of the individual systems.
Scope: Proposals should focus on methods how to optimise the control of powertrains taking into account specific transportation tasks. This can be achieved by using the information provided by new generation navigation systems and emission sensors linked to the On Board Diagnosis/On Board Measuring system in combination with electronics and actuators. The strategy will use data such as transport assignment (total weight, vehicle configuration, etc.), traffic and weather conditions, topography and road network on the chosen route, driving patterns of the surrounding vehicles, the state of the combustion engine, after treatment and transmission, monitored emissions emitted, etc. The resulting technology should deliver a global optimum for consumption (for both fuel, electric energy and other consumables related to emission control such as urea or ammonia) and noxious emissions on each mission, to be validated through a demonstrator.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 7 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: A reduction of fuel consumption of at least 20% on the same vehicle with conventional control should be demonstrated comparatively, while not exceeding Real Driving Emissions limits set by the established Euro VI procedures.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The challenge is the development of advanced non-hybrid powertrain concepts for heavy duty vehicles (either dual-fuel or optimised for pure natural gas operation), complying with the Euro VI standards and meeting the CO2/km emissions targets currently under definition.
This will deliver significant air quality improvements, particularly in terms of particle numbers and NOx in real driving conditions.
In order to achieve a real impact on the societal challenges, vehicles using the developed technology need to be competitive with current vehicles using conventional fuels. Therefore an additional technological challenge is to develop specific components (for instance better fuel tanks for liquefied natural gas with improved thermal insulation, optimised pressure handling systems and methane catalysers) for these types of fuels with lower cost, volume and weight while keeping high safety standards.
Scope: Proposals should include adequate combinations of combustion process optimisation, variable compression ratios, engine control, dual fuel operation, optimised fuel injection systems, adaptive systems and sensors to take into account different fuel qualities, new generation after-treatment systems (in particular for NOx and methane slip especially during transients and at low temperatures) and overall powertrain optimisation, advanced fuel tanks (high pressure  gaseous, liquid or solid state) and any other innovative concepts and components for the different vehicle categories.
Ranges before fuelling should be demonstrated of at least 800 km on natural gas while keeping weight, volume and cost penalties to a similar level to current best in class vehicles.
All developed technology should be integrated on vehicles that should be tested by independent bodies on the World Heavy Duty Cycle (WHDC) test procedures, including the relevant Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) approaches.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 to 20 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Real driving emission levels respecting post-2020 emission limits and procedures shall be achieved in order to address the air quality challenge. The capability to maintain this performance during the engine life should be also demonstrated through accelerated ageing procedures.
As far as the climate change challenge is concerned, the research target is to achieve at least 10% lower CO2-equivalent emissions (i.e. including unburned methane and N2O) than the best vehicles on the market in 2013 using the same fuel (natural gas for pure methane engines, diesel in the case of dual fuel systems).

Specific challenge: The EU Joint Programming Initiative on Neurodegenerative Diseases Research, in particular Alzheimer's (JPND), was established in 2009 as the pilot of the Member State-led Joint Programming Initiatives (JPI) to enable the participating EU Member States to work together on the challenge of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Throughout the past five years, the JPND has proved an important tool for the establishment of a European Research Area in this field. The JPND has made considerable progress in enabling Member States to pursue common visions, and contributed greatly to increasing awareness and creating an unprecedented mobilization of human resources, actions, and funding to tackle the challenge of neurodegenerative diseases. The HCO 7 – 2014 topic calling for an ERA-NET provides opportunity to the JPND to leverage the support for the implementation of its Strategic Research Agenda, as well as to network and align Members’ research activities.  
Another immediate challenge for the JPND is managing and extending its capacities. In this context, the JPND should capitalize on the current momentum to take the necessary management steps for securing its sustainability by Member States, to extend globally and mobilize the Members States which are not yet participating in the JPND, and to take up actions at the national level. The JPND’s major achievements and expected future developments call for careful planning for its long-term sustainability, in particular because as the pilot JPI, the JPND is paving the way for other JPIs. A sustainable structure should allow the JPND to progressively move from coordination to integration of national research activities, to further develop its visibility at global level, and to facilitate greater innovation to improve the quality of life for people with neurodegenerative diseases and their carers while reducing emotional and financial burden.
 Scope: Proposals should support the development and extension of the JPND capacities. In particular, resources should be used to:
         Explore possible scenarios for long-term sustainability by Member States and create political awareness to prepare their implementation. The project should also dedicate resources to develop and implement a dedicated structure responsible for the long-term JPND management and implementation;
         Extend the capacities of the JPND globally and to the Members States which are not yet participating in the JPND. For this purpose, the project should dedicate resources to implement its global strategy and develop a strategy to attract and raise awareness of the missing EU-13 Member States. This should include identification of available national research & innovation resources in the area of neurodegenerative diseases;
         Develop and implement current and new strategies for further coordination of national and JPND research agendas, and in particular for the take-up of JPND strategies and policies at national level. This should clearly demonstrate the leverage effect of the JPND. In this context, the project should dedicate resources to develop and implement initiatives for knowledge management, brokerage and transfer, as well as establishing collaborations with other initiatives or partners at European and global level;
         Provide innovative strategies for the creation of infrastructures and tools to facilitate more rapid uptake of data and methodologies for research on neurodegenerative diseases in EU and beyond;
         Facilitate building networks of industrial and academic experts to boost industrial innovation in the field of neurodegenerative diseases research in Europe in collaboration with IMI.
The proposal should not duplicate work already covered under HCO 7. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact:
         Reinforcing the JPI scheme as a major tool for the achievement of the European Research Area;
         Implementing a stronger global dimension of the JPND, aligned with the G8 summit on dementia recommendations[1];
         Increased multiannual commitment of JPND members, long-term sustainability of the JPND research and innovation strategy, and long-term structuring effect and critical mass mobilization;
         Achieving coordination and integration of national research & innovation programmes with the JPND research strategy in coherence with Horizon 2020 objectives;
         Faster international progress for research and innovation on neurodegenerative diseases through the development of novel research tools and infrastructures;
         Increasing efficiency of research and innovation investments by European Member States by avoiding duplication of research and infrastructure investment at national level;
         Awareness and potential extension of the JPND to missing EU-13 Member States;
         Further establishing the JPND as a reference for European and global knowledge and innovation platform in the area of neurodegenerative diseases.

Specific challenge: Facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs within this societal challenge with a view to identifying and sharing good practice and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of this societal challenge.
Scope: Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of this societal challenge.   The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to this societal challenge as well as to gender dimension of Research and Innovation, and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. Liaison with other support structures, projects and programmes (e.g., IMI2, EDCTP2, IPR helpdesk, EEN, EMA) should be detailed in the proposal.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to this societal challenge and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Science with and for Society’.
Only NCPs from EU Member States and Associated Countries (and other countries only where fully justified) which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops) and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic.
Expected impact:
An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.

Scope:
Coordination of the Quantum Technologies Flagship
Proposals should ensure the smooth running and further development of the Flagship, support the implementation of the overall EU strategy in quantum technologies, including governance, raise the profile of the Flagship's activities and of quantum technologies in general, and update the European Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, in particular by working on the following: support the operation of the Flagship’s governance structure; conduct a community based process for preparing a Research and Innovation investment Roadmap and priorities by involving research and industry stakeholders, undertake wide dissemination of the Quantum Flagship results; organise outreach events and engage in structured discussions with the general public, including on the social implications and ethics of quantum technology development and innovation, particularly with regard to privacy and security, public trust and acceptance; provide research dissemination services to projects; identify relevant training, education and infrastructure needs.
This structured dialogue with the general public will take the form of engagement via all meaningful platforms including social media, and the results may be compared with those of international cooperation partners of the Flagship (e.g. Canada), and shared on the basis of mutual exchange. Proposals should also encourage the Flagship’s projects to find synergies in their activities, contribute to the overall EU strategy in the field (e.g. EuroQCI, EuroHPC), and share best practice, and to foster the growth of a European quantum community that links all academic and industry stakeholders, including by contributing to the coordination of activities between European, national and regional programmes and projects.
Proposals should include concrete activities to coordinate and streamline European industrial efforts in quantum technology to help unlock research from laboratories and forge a supply chain in Europe. Proposals should feature a plan enabling the translation of academic research in all Flagship pillars (quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communications, and quantum sensing and metrology) into practical quantum technology and applications.
Finally, proposals should work on establishing dialogue with other international programmes in quantum technologies and in promoting international cooperation activities. In particular, they should be supporting collaborative discussions between the main international players, including countries such as the USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the EU, exploiting complementary strengths and challenges in collaborative research that ensures a clear win-win situation for both parties and ongoing leadership on the global stage.
Proposals should involve and be driven by representatives of the relevant actors in the field (e.g. academia, RTOs, and industry, including SMEs).
All proposals should contribute to spreading excellence across Europe; for example, through the involvement of Widening Countries.
Standardisation
Proposals should address concrete standardisation activities in European and international standardisation fora where quantum technologies will play a major role in the near future and where standardisation can enhance existing capabilities and offer a competitive advantage to Europe. Examples are: quantum computing and quantum-enabled security such as QKD, QRNG, quantum sensing and metrology, including quantum enhanced medical imaging devices, quantum gravity sensing devices, quantum timing devices, etc.
For this, proposals should develop an active presence and leadership in the coordination and development of international standards and regulations in quantum technologies either in existing standardisation activities and bodies and where relevant, by contributing to creating new standardisation activities in existing groups and/or creation of new groups.
Proposals should bring together all the relevant stakeholders in the whole quantum technology standardisation value chain – research, standardisation and the industry sectors, and if relevant, public administrations/institutions. They should describe which players they will mobilise and how they will efficiently coordinate them at European level to achieve impactful results promoting the European interests in standardisation. Links to metrology aspects should also be included, wherever relevant.
Education and training
Proposals should perform an extensive mapping of current and future requirements for education and training; define standards for implementing appropriate educational strategies; host existing and newly developed teaching materials and resources within a repository; develop strategies for scaling up advanced quantum technology training programmes across Europe; and establish a network between science, civil society, and industry to exchange ideas, needs, and human resources (e.g. in the form of student internships). In doing so, they should work in close cooperation with the Flagship project actors.
Proposals should also address the coordination of the education activities and strategies they would work upon with the relevant national actors.
Proposals should involve and be driven by representatives of the relevant actors of the field (e.g., academia, RTOs, and industry, including SMEs, and intermediaries). They should take into account synergies with activities in advanced digital skills supported by the Digital Europe Programme.

","22 June 2021
","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Providing strategic business development plans for the re-opening of more than 20 industrial sites in Europe, which have recently been closed or are about to be closed in the next months;
Proposing networks of key players, stakeholders and projects to support regions exploring new approaches to address the challenges of green and digital transition of industries, an innovation-led and place-based approach inherent in Smart Specialisation, building on the specific assets and resources of each individual region concerned, supporting regional entrepreneurial culture, infrastructure and innovators;
Analysing the regional cross-fertilization potential between traditional, high-tech and digital sectors, education and research, federal and local authorities, early stage venture capital and innovators;
Promote the establishment of a new sustainable and inclusive regional industry eco-system;
Identification of innovation barriers and recommendations for policy support;
Analysis should be based on key figures like: Economic growth rates and Per Capita GDP, salaries; labour and unemployment rate of different population groups; innovation power in terms of patent applications; number of business registrations per year; tax revenues, taking also into gender and demographic data.
Scope:
European innovation policy must place a greater emphasis on promoting innovation in less-developed regions to trigger economic recovery in regions the local economies and societies suffered from the recent closing down of industrial plants and sites, which had once offered lots of jobs in these regions and has thus ensured a level of prosperity for the local population.
Aiming at achieving a sustainable and inclusive industrial transformation, Europe needs to develop new industrial policies relaunching productivity growth in regions suffering most from COVID-19 and economic situations of radical change. This will also help to achieve a competitive social market economy in Europe that seeks to guarantee a balance in living standards and economic conditions between urban and rural areas as well as regions.
The objective of this coordination and support action is to analyse the industrial ecosystem of more than 20 regions in Europe and how they could be influenced by comprehensive industrial policies, innovation programs, private investments accompanied with modern regional administration policies and public investment in infrastructures, both digital and transportation. Focus is both, on the growth of the digital industries, and on the transformation of traditional industries and the creation of new business opportunities that could offer the potential for a long term value creation and for new jobs.
The coordination and support action should network the stakeholders across entire innovation value-chains and regional development programs. A holistic approach is needed, mobilizing a diverse set of players from private and public organisations. The translation of an industrial revitalization into integrated business development solutions across disciplines should be envisaged and sustainable and inclusive regional-specific business development strategies should be proposed to be taken up. In particular, the key actors in the region, who have a “gravitational pull” should play a key role should be identified and involved.
The interplay between large companies and the start-up scene, authorities and financial organisations are important success factor for a region. The strength of the industrial innovation ecosystem should be summarised by characteristics such as robustness, diversity in particular in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, cross-fertilisation between sectors, large and small companies spurring the ecosystem, entrepreneurial culture, well connected across the world, openness to disruption, platform-economy, supportive state, public procurement and education and acceptance by the local population.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
A comprehensive assessment of the climate mitigation potential of European forests and forest-based sector through modelling of different policy pathways, taking into account climate change related risks, physiological and biogeochemical responses to environmental change and management practices, adaptation needs, biodiversity goals, and the provision of other ecosystem services. The effects analysed have to include changes in carbon sequestration, forest health, productivity, substitution and biophysical factors, including the causes and time dynamics of these changes. The assessment of the potential and limits of forest-based products and biomass for energy in delivering climate benefits will inform public authorities on the most suitable approach to forest policy and forest bioeconomy.
Development and improvement of robust and transparent methodologies for high-resolution monitoring and reporting of forest carbon pools and their interactions through a combination of in-situ data collection and remote sensing methods to be used to advance land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) reporting under the UNFCCC and compliance under EU legislation. Methods developed under this action will additionally feed into the development of the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE).
Scope:
Proposals under this topic should develop a comprehensive assessment of different pathways of the European forest GHG balance in view of the reviewed 2030 and 2050 climate targets and other relevant EU environmental legislation and objectives incorporating:
Biodiversity goals consistent with the EU Green Deal objectives and Biodiversity Strategy 2030 goals. Issues considered include the use non-native tree species, intensive thinning, transition between intensive and close-to-nature silviculture, and strict protection of forests.
Uncertainties related to climate change and natural disturbances risks.
Adaptation needs of existing and future forests, including factors determining their adaptation potential.
Mitigation potential of afforestation and other forest activities including their opportunity costs.
GHG impact of forest bioeconomy, including substitution effect of forest-based products and energy against realistic counterfactuals and with appropriate time dynamics.
Renewable energy targets and the needs of forest-based bioeconomy for sustainable domestically-sourced feedstock.
Biophysical effects, including changes in air temperature and precipitation associated to changes in surface albedo, land-surface properties, emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, transpiration and heat flux.
Assessment of trade-offs and synergies between climate-oriented forest management, and other objectives, for example recreational and amenity values;
Having such models/assessment at their disposal and understanding their time dynamics, uncertainties and system boundaries, policy-makers will be better suited to incorporate forests in the design and evaluation of possible solutions and pathways for climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Monitoring and reporting on changes to forest carbon stocks is essential for policymakers (both national and European) in order to be informed of trends in the forest sink evolution and to develop annual approximated greenhouse gas inventories. Actions should support the use of higher tier (and higher accuracy) methodologies and geographically explicit land-use data in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories[1] and its 2019 Refinement[2]. Especially needed are actions to fill existing gaps resulting from inventory bias towards the most economically relevant tree species and carbon pools.
Proposals under this topic should therefore aim to develop knowledge, tools, models, databases and country- and region-specific values available to Member States and Associated Countries, where possible integrating with Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and climate models to improve monitoring and reporting of forest carbon pools. Remote sensing data sets can be helpful in estimating or verifying forest living biomass gains and losses, forest area changes, forest health status and in identifying carbon-rich old-growth forests or natural disturbances. Sample-based systems, on the other hand, should support mapping changes in other forest carbon pools such as soil organic carbon in mineral and organic soils, and dead organic matter. More robust estimation of fluxes among these forest carbon pools, which are often neglected in greenhouse gas inventories, will assist in estimating their importance as carbon reservoirs and the role that forest management can play in enhancing them, taking into account biodiversity needs and resilience. Considering biophysical effects will improve the understanding of trade-offs among climate objectives and their articulation with forest management practices.
Actions should envisage coordinating activities with other relevant actions, initiatives and programmes, including Horizon 2020 Work Programmes and the LIFE Programme, COPERNICUS and relevant research infrastructures to promote synergies, integration and co-operation. They should make use and contribute to knowledge exchange and networking European platforms and consider devising a novel decision-making platform to ensure effective dissemination of the results to the target stakeholders (i.e. policy-makers and relevant national competent authorities). Cooperation and planning for further exploitation of actions results during and after the project end is strongly encouraged.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
For Area A:
Safer but also lighter and circular vehicle structures.
Advanced vehicle concepts with higher compatibility between vehicles of different sizes and masses in dissimilar crashes.
Advanced structural designs tolerant to a wider set of crash angles.
Demonstration of a minimum number of crash tests designed to validate virtual testing for a large number of different scenarios

For Area B
Reduced driver distraction as an important factor in road crashes.
Intuitive and unobtrusive information of drivers and other road users about expected actions at any time.
Safer mobility for all road users including the ones with impaired mental and/or physical capacity.
Availability of human-centric adaptive interfaces and positive stimulation and utilisation of human abilities by new human-technology interfaces.
Improved validation methods for HMI.
Scope:
Actions should address the activities EITHER under area A) Testing safe lightweight vehicles OR under area B) Safe human-technology interaction in the future traffic system. Proposals should clearly indicate which area they are covering.
Area A –Testing safe lightweight vehicles
Automotive safety has significantly progressed in the last decades thanks to advanced modelling and testing capabilities and new structural concepts, as well as the introduction of active safety.
Future vehicles and their structures, however, will have to be lighter and lighter, and this means already an intrinsic reduction of safety when crashing with a heavier crash counterpart. Moreover, new structural concepts will need to be more and more designed with a circular use of materials in mind, and structures with mixed light materials and related manufacturing concepts (including casting and 3D printing of complex shapes, for instance in energy absorbers or highly integrated structural components) will be widely different from today’s mostly sheet steel based concepts. Advanced testing on crash, toughness, fracture and fatigue of new materials and concepts should be performed where relevant. A smart integration of these concepts are expected to lead the demonstration of a more sustainable and safe body-in-white with at least a 10% weight reduction on already achieved results for multimaterial research structures.
In this context, the proposed actions should analyse the crash scenarios of the future, considering active safety devices but also their potential failure and the fact that for a long time there will be a mixed traffic situation where automated and semi-automated vehicles will share the road with normal “manually driven” vehicles and all types of unprotected road users.
This requires a new way of conceiving structures and their components, to ensure that all requirements are met at the same time and to further increase safety by including vehicle compatibility concept, like harmonised rigidity between light and heavy vehicles, so that the heavy vehicle helps the more vulnerable one in absorbing the impact energy. Standardised positions for crash absorbing elements should be addressed to ensure the best engagement scenarios, as well as multi-angle optimisation, to avoid that structures are optimised only for the exact test cases in regulation or in EuroNCAP tests. A significant number of crash tests is expected to be performed for validating the different scenarios.
Area B –Safe human-technology interaction in the future traffic system
Another challenge for the safety in future transport systems and services is the ever growing and intensified human interaction with ubiquitous digital content. The overload of various kinds of information from multiple sources can lead to increased driver or unprotected road user distraction and have negative impacts on road safety.
Human machine interfaces (HMI) with adaptive characteristics continue to be developed and new functionalities are continuously added, yet the impacts of those systems on the behaviour of drivers and other road users are not sufficiently known. Further research on the effects of such technologies in road transport safety is required.
These adaptive HMI systems can support a wide range of traffic users and could be included in scenarios based on the mixed traffic and accidentology where needed. As such the applications are not limited to higher levels of vehicle automation. Therefore, they need to consider a wide variation of human capabilities and reactions as well as long-term mental and physical capacities (including disabilities and disorders) and instantaneous limitations in capabilities (collapse, illness, drowsiness, etc.).
In particular, the following aspects should be considered by future research:
Design and development of intuitive, understandable, non-distracting and reliable adaptive interfaces for human-technology interaction in road vehicles minimising training needs for safe usage.
Develop concepts of external interfaces, also considering the characteristics (for instance speed, direction) that are possible to interpret and understand by all road users.
Understand long-term effects (physical and mental), potential risks and possible benefits for road users exposed to and actively using adaptive HMI technologies, and propose means to improve or maintain road user performance in terms of safety.
Development of safety validation methods for new adaptive HMI technologies.
While this topic is open to research on all human-technology interaction in the road transport system, specific issues of the interaction of highly automated vehicles with their occupants and other road users are covered in topic HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-02.
Typically, projects should have a duration of 36 to 48 months. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

The topic will support the transition towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just circular economy at local and regional scale across regions of Europe.
Proposals funded under this topic will form part of the demonstration projects for the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI)[1]. Proposals are expected to provide policy-makers, public and private investors and local communities with concrete and demonstrated examples of circular systemic solutions. In the context of this topic, a circular systemic solution is defined as a demonstration project for deploying a circular and climate-neutral economy at urban and/or regional scale, involving key stakeholders and, ideally, addressing more than one economic sector.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Improved circularity and reduced GHG emissions in economic sectors, natural ecosystems, and efficient valorisation of local resources in cities, regions or their groupings.
Creation of business opportunities in the circular economy at urban and/or regional scale.
Increased circular and climate-neutral practices among citizens and their participation in circular systemic solutions.
Enhanced knowledge transfer between the cities, regions or their groupings involved in the proposals financed under this topic and other cities and regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries.
Creation of jobs in the short to medium-term perspective.
More effective widespread uptake and easier replication, scalability and visibility of circular systemic solutions and hence multiplication of their economic, social and environmental benefits to achieve the policy targets of the European Green Deal, circular economy action plan, EU bioeconomy strategy and the European industrial strategy at local, regional, national, European and international levels.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions for the deployment of the circular economy (including the circular bioeconomy) in cities, regions or their groupings.
The implemented circular systemic solutions should address economic, social and environmental dimensions of the transition towards a circular economy and include science, technology and governance components. They should demonstrate circular governance models and support the active participation of all relevant actors in cities, regions or their groupings. Examples of relevant actors are: public administrations and utilities; private sector services and industries, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs); scientific and innovator communities including incubators and accelerators; financial intermediaries with a focus on environmental and social impact; venture capitalists and business angels; civil society, including citizens; and non-governmental organisations and philanthropy.
The implemented circular systemic solutions may consider applying the circular economy principle not only to waste and water management, but also to other sectors including, for example, one or more of the new circular economy action plan key product value chains, i.e.: batteries and vehicles, electronics and ICT, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients.[2] The circular systemic solutions may also include nature-based solutions. Circular systemic solutions and the economic sectors involved in them should be selected and based on a detailed analysis of the cities, regions or their groupings’ socio-economic and environmental needs to be addressed, circular potential to be exploited and challenges to be tackled.
Circular systemic solutions should identify, analyse and, when feasible, quantify the economic, social and environmental benefits and trade-offs/challenges related to their implementation and demonstration. They should include the monitoring and evaluation of the transition towards a circular economy, identify their strengths and weaknesses as well as causes. They should analyse the experimented regulatory obstacles and drivers and provide clear and precise policy recommendations to improve circular economy. Each circular systemic solution should address environmental externalities and contribute to preserving and, where possible, increasing the well-being and the health conditions of the local communities involved in the transition towards a circular economy.
It is crucial that the circular systemic solutions implemented and their business models have a high replicability and scalability potential. This is fundamental to facilitate that circular systemic solutions demonstrated in specific areas will be replicated in others. During their implementation and by the end of their life cycle, the selected proposals are expected to share with all stakeholders clear and comprehensive guidelines on the circular systemic solutions adopted, including their strengths and weaknesses experienced.
It is essential that proposals also ensure complementarity and cooperation with existing and future relevant European projects on the circular economy and the circular bioeconomy, with special reference to those on local and regional scale, and avoid overlaps and repetition. In particular, cooperation and complementarity should be ensured with the projects under the European Green Deal Call’s topic ‘LC-GD-3-2-2020 - Demonstration of systemic solutions for the territorial deployment of the circular economy’.[3]

The EU’s relationship with Africa is a key priority for the EU. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing urgency of the climate crisis put pressure on both domestic/local food production and on ecosystems that generate higher health risks for plants, animals and humans with the emergence of new pest and diseases.
In line with the farm to fork strategy, and the development of Green Alliances on sustainable food systems, successful proposals will provide a comprehensive and integrated response to current and future challenges benefiting people, nature and economic growth in Europe and in Africa.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
EU – Africa jointly tackle climate change and environment-related challenges and meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals;
develop nature-based solutions to plant nutrition, plant health and animal health addressing human health, with innovative methods and technologies that optimize, and limit when necessary, the use of external inputs and helps farmers in the implementation of regulated deficit strategies;
strengthened transdisciplinary research and integrated scientific support for relevant EU policies and priorities (the EU strategy for Africa, European Green Deal objectives, etc.);
In line with the EU priorities, proposals should take into consideration the objectives of the European One Health Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) [1]that aim at making the EU a best practice region, boosting research, development and innovation and shaping the global agenda.
Scope:
The “One Health” approach to plant and animal health is based on a systemic perspective linking the health of ecosystems, animals and humans. It requires interventions at different level (local, territorial, value chain) and coherent public policies. ‘One Health’ can be applied to establish a transformative approach to increasing sustainable practices in agriculture and improving the overall health and well-being of humans, animals, and natural ecosystems.
There is a need to fill knowledge gap regarding interactions with different components and especially between human and animal and plant health and strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems to prevent the emergence and spread of pest and diseases with nature-based solutions.
Proposals should build on existing and new knowledge, data, models (including in situ calibration measurement) and available tools to:
identify local farm animals and crops in the different agro-ecological zones in Africa to maintain/increase productivity, resilience and nutritional quality taking into account the interactions between plants, animals, diseases, pests, zoonosis and ecosystems under conditions of limited external inputs and increased abiotic and biotic stresses;
develop innovative means including innovative methodologies for risk assessments and practices to tackle current and emerging plant pests and diseases, pests and zoonosis (including transboundary infectious livestock diseases) taking into account the interactions between plants, livestock health and the natural ecosystems;
develop sustainable and systemic integrated approaches to plant and animal health from farm to international scales in line with a greener agriculture by optimising resource efficiency, minimising production losses and avoiding geographical spread of diseases/pathogens (i.e. control of locusts or other migratory pests, development of vaccines) including animal breeding and being responsible/respectful of natural ecosystem integrity, goods and services;
establish a multidisciplinary team that works together to achieve these outcomes and bring together experts from academic, government, public, and private institutions to achieve meaningful change in public awareness, policies, and practices that support implementation of sustainable agricultural practices.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector and, as relevant, bio-based industry active in rural areas.

In line with the farm to fork strategy, the successful proposals will help to promote a global transition to sustainable food systems. They will therefore help to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population and support the development and implementation of integrated pest management practices. They will strengthen international cooperation with actors from China in the areas of integrated pest management.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
reduce the use of pesticides for crops of importance to the EU, Associated Countries and China which dependency on chemical pest management is currently high;
increase on-farm use and implementation of integrated pest management practices;
develop integrated pest management training for farmers/growers and extend the range of applications through incentives to increase the uptake of integrated pest management practices;
raise awareness of integrated pest management practices and improve product quality and food safety by decreased residue concentrations of pesticides in crops and lower environmental impact.
Scope:
A high percentage of food crops is lost to plant pests and diseases annually. At the same time, concerns are mounting over the impact of pesticides used in agriculture on the environment, non-target organisms and human health. Proposals should support the development and implementation of integrated pest management practices for crops where the dependency on conventional chemical pesticides is the highest, and where the exchange of information, best practices and technologies is of benefit to the EU, Associated Countries and China.
Proposals should:
enlarge the range of tools available for integrated pest management practices, such as crop diversification leading to more functional diversity, effective cropping techniques, appropriate species and varieties resistant to pests, the development of biological control agents, the preservation and enhancement of natural enemies of pests etc.;
develop technologies enabling the prevention, modelling and monitoring of pest emergence allowing timely and appropriate intervention in line with the principles of integrated pest management;
develop risk assessment methods for assessing the risks and environmental impacts of these technologies;
support capacity building, training and education enabling farmers/growers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices in pest management and the establishment of a reward/incentives system.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach’ and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector. Practical solutions for farmers/growers, close to the market, should be facilitated by the involvement of industry, including SMEs, to promote the transfer of technology relating to integrated pest management.
Actions will contribute to implementing the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) flagship initiative, which aims to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population, the reduction of food and agricultural losses and waste, and the provision of safe and healthy foodstuffs.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China. This topic is envisaged to be implemented as a coordinated call but if no agreement is reached with the Ministry of Science and Technology China (MOST) on the co-funding of Chinese partners, it will be implemented as a normal call.

In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the successful proposal will interconnect national contact point (NCP) service across Europe and will help develop innovative governance models enabling sustainability and resilience notably to achieve better informed decision-making processes, societal engagement and innovation.
An improved and more interconnected national contact point (NCP) service across Europe, in the areas covered by Horizon Europe Cluster 6 ‘Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment’, thereby simplifying access to Cluster 6 Horizon Europe calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
A more harmonised level of NCP support services across Europe.
Enhanced integration of all the crosscutting issues throughout Horizon Europe.
Increased participation of less active member states, associated countries, regions and stakeholders in the actions funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 6 programme to leverage the full R&I potential.
Connection with NCP Academy activities.
Increased cooperation of NCPs with the enterprise Europe network.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between national contact points (NCPs) in the areas covered by Horizon Europe Cluster 6 ‘Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment’, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of this cluster. In addition, the action is expected to provide important feedback on issues relating to programme planning, design and evaluation.
Proposal should aim to facilitate trans-cluster cooperation in the areas covered by Pilar 2, with a view to identifying synergies, to make it possible to share good practices and tools. Close coordination and cooperation are key to achieve the objectives and impacts of the NCP networks.
The activities of this topic should build on the knowledge and tools already generated by the NCP networks developed under Horizon 2020.
In view of the changes brought about by the adoption of Horizon Europe, the network of NCPs is expected to organise transnational events to communicate with all interested actors regarding new research activities; to draw lessons from previous research programmes on best practice for cooperation; to help interested stakeholders prepare for new funding schemes and structures.
The network is expected to organise NCP Information Days, NCP trainings, brokerage events for interested actors, dissemination of relevant results and provide appropriate tools and instruments to support NCPs, researchers and other actors. Activities will support researchers and other actors in the areas of food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment to connect into all clusters of Pillar 2 and across the three pillars of Horizon Europe. To achieve its expected outcomes and objectives, the NCP network should cooperate with, but should not duplicate actions foreseen in other thematic and horizontal Horizon Europe NCP networks, and in other networks such as the Enterprise Europe Network.[1]
Proposals should include a work package to implement matchmaking activities to link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of Cluster 6 ‘Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment’. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. Attention should be paid to increase participation of newcomers throughout Europe less active member states, associated countries, regions and stakeholders. Where relevant, synergies should be sought with the enterprise Europe network to organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP minimum standards and guiding principles.”
Special attention should be given to enhancing the competence of NCPs, including helping new and less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how built up in other countries. This should contribute to increase the quality of proposals submitted, including those from countries where success rates in Horizon 2020 Societal Challenges 2 and 5 were lower than average.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged and it should cover the whole duration of Horizon Europe.
Countries not participating as beneficiaries of the action may benefit from the activities carried out by the network.

Successful proposals will enhance new knowledge and design or improve tools to achieve better informed decision-making processes and better integrated policies, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal, with particular focus on supporting the Water Framework Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Nature Directives. In this way proposals will contribute to the development or improvement of innovative governance models enabling sustainability and resilience and of EU and international science-policy interfaces.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Better understanding of policy (in)coherence, potential weaknesses in cross-compliance, trade-offs and underexploited synergies between marine/maritime policies, legislation and regulation is used by the policy making community
to halt biodiversity decline and enhance biodiversity and ecosystem restoration and conservation for the benefit of local communities
to favour nature-based climate adaptation and mitigation measures
to achieve progress towards zero pollution.
Analytical contributions, orientations and proposals to improve international, European, national or regional marine/maritime policies, legislation, regulation and their implementation, are provided to the policy making community in order to fully integrate the environmental, social and health requirements and considerations, enabling a better integration and harmonisation of policies.
Better understanding of (a potentially regulatorily consolidated) lack of biodiversity, pollution or climate related considerations and socio-economic power balances in decision making that could disadvantage biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and restoration and ecosystem services’ benefits to local communities or disadvantage pollution prevention, reduction and remediation; is used to the benefit of international cooperation and development aid for local communities.
Better understanding of the effects of different climate adaptation measures on good ecological, environmental or conservation status, is leading to tangible support for nature-based and socially acceptable climate adaptation and mitigation strategies with low carbon footprint.
Better understanding of the weaknesses in consistency between emission control regulation and fresh water and marine environmental quality standards for chemical substances and user or prohibition guidelines at local level (communes, garden maintenance companies etc.), as well as food quality and safety or other health standards is used by the policy making community.
Better understanding of the weaknesses in cross-compliance between common agricultural policy and the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) such as in relation to eutrophication in fresh and marine waters has inspired the policy making community to introduce improvements.
The policy making community exploited a better insight in how the Member States’ Maritime Spatial Plans, River Basin Management Plans and MSFD measures link together concerning climate adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and restoration, and pollution.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on implementation research on environmental and social cross-compliance of a broad range of marine and maritime policies to detect inconsistencies between different policies, legislation and regulations as barriers for the Green Deal and its strategies (EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, Climate Adaptation Strategy, the zero pollution ambition) in the marine domain.
Actions should address one or more of the following options:
1. Environmental and social cross-compliance and coherence of marine policies for nature-based climate adaptation and mitigation
A sufficient scientific knowledge base is needed to be able to judge and avoid potential exemptions of Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive requirements or conflicts with NATURA 2000 legislation for new coastal infrastructure licences for climate adaptation and mitigation actions. The implementation of Article 4(7) of the WFD on how to deal with new physical modifications to (including coastal) water bodies currently differs considerably from one Member State to another[1].
Proposals should analyse European, national or regional marine/maritime policies, legislation and regulation, in particular related to the Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Nature Directives versus marine sectorial and marine spatial planning legislation, regulation and implementation focusing on climate adaptation and mitigation. Proposals should review the knowledge on the effects of different climate adaptation and mitigation measures on good ecological, environmental or conservation status, also taking into account the benefits of traditional and indigenous knowledge and experience on climate adaptation and mitigation ecosystem services for integration in policy implementation.
Proposals should identify weaknesses in cross-compliance and coherence of marine/maritime policies, legislation and regulation to favour nature-based climate adaptation and mitigation measures. They should make proposals for improvement and define research and innovation needs to cover gaps in knowledge to assess effects of different climate adaptation and mitigation measures on good ecological, environmental or conservation status to support environmentally friendly decision making.
2. Environmental and social cross-compliance and coherence of marine policies to halt biodiversity decline and enhance restoration and conservation for the benefit of local communities
Proposals should analyse international, European, national or regional marine/maritime policies, legislation and regulation (Convention on Biological Diversity, Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, Environmental Impact Assessment etc.) versus marine sectorial (such as International Seabed Authority, international fisheries regulation, fossil fuel exploration/exploitation, marine wildlife trade, agriculture, waste, etc.) and marine spatial planning legislation, regulation and implementation focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and restoration, including Marine Protected Area assignments.
Proposals should identify weaknesses in cross-compliance and coherence of marine/maritime policies, legislation and regulation to halt biodiversity decline and enhance restoration and conservation for the benefit of local communities. They should make proposals for improvement to support environmentally friendly decision making at all governance levels, also taking into account the benefits of traditional and indigenous knowledge and experience on biodiversity and ecosystem services for integration in policy implementation.
3. Environmental and social cross-compliance and coherence of marine policies to achieve progress towards zero pollution
Proposals should focus on implementation research on environmental and social cross-compliance and coherence of a broad range of marine and maritime policies to detect inconsistencies between different policies, legislation and regulations in order to achieve progress in the elimination of historical and future pollution. Proposals should analyse international, European, national or regional marine/maritime policies, legislation and regulation, versus marine sectorial legislation, regulation and implementation focusing on all kinds of pollution. They should make proposals for improvement to eliminate inconsistencies at all relevant governance levels and define potential scientific needs to achieve them.
The size of requested EU contribution should be commensurate to the breadth of the project scope.
The proposals should cover a representative set of coastal areas or regions across Europe varying according to size and geographical, environmental, socio-economic, institutional and administrative conditions (regional, inter-regional, macro-region, cross-border).
Interactive research approaches should be used to engage with local, regional, national and – where relevant - international authorities, as well as local communities, citizens and other relevant stakeholders, considering gender, age and socio-economic background, where relevant.
Projects should build on existing knowledge and integrate results from multiple origins, including other EU, international (for example UN) or national projects or studies. Some cooperation activities with projects financed under topics from Destinations “Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services” and “Clean environment and zero pollution” and Green Deal calls (like LC-GD-7-1-2020 Restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) could be included. This topic should also be linked to the Horizon Europe Missions Ocean, seas and waters and Adaptation to Climate Change including Societal Transformation, the Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy, the Biodiversity Partnership, the Partnership Water security for the planet (Water4All) or other partnerships where relevant.

In line with the farm to fork strategy and the Headline ambitions of a Digital Age and an Economy that works for people, leaving no one behind, the biodiversity strategy, the successful proposals will support the development of capacities for assessing and demonstrating environmental and socio-economic effects of digital technologies in agriculture. They will therefore contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers through research and innovation in the field of the assessment of impacts of digital technologies in agriculture.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Awareness and informed decisions based on the demonstration of the costs and benefits of the use of digital technologies for the agricultural sector.
Facilitated uptake of digital technologies by farmers, including through decision-making support and the analysis of farmers’ motivations.
Strengthen the capacities of farmers` advisors in the field of digital technologies.
Strengthening the capacities to design, implement, monitor and evaluate policy measures in the fields of agriculture, environment and climate, as basis for better tailored, more effective and efficient policy measures in the fields of digitalisation in agriculture, and sustainability.
Scope:
Digital technologies in agriculture and their potential to increase farms` economic and sustainability performance, facilitate work and enhance working conditions has received huge attention in the political sphere in recent years. Agriculture has to play a key role in achieving environmental and climate ambitions in the EU, and digital technologies offer opportunities to increase the sustainability performance of the agricultural sector. However, there is still a huge “gap” between the portfolio of digital technologies offered at the market and the actual uptake and use by farmers in the EU. Moreover, while the potential of digital technologies to better tailor agricultural production is widely acknowledged, there is little knowledge about the actual reduction of negative environmental and climate effects due to their application.
Studies show that among key uptake barriers hindering the farmers to make use of digital technologies are a) a lack of knowledge about those tools in general, as well as their costs and benefits, b) a lack of overview of the strengths and weaknesses of certain tools in the huge portfolio offered on markets and the suitability to address farm-specific needs, and c) a lack of believe in the added value of digital technologies for the management of a farm. An additional barrier to the uptake of digital technologies by farmers presents the effort needed to become familiar with new tools. For many farmers the real demonstration of effects as well as “hard figures” of production effects are important to be convinced to apply a certain method/ technology. Also cultural aspects play a role in the perception of digital technologies.
The effectiveness of digital technologies as it regards sustainability gains between laboratory conditions and the environmental and socio-economic reality vary.
Independent assessments of the effects of the use of the range of digital technologies tools under ideal and real-life conditions are essential for policy development, monitoring and evaluation. For many environmental parameters, the final impacts of farming can only be assessed with a huge time lag/ delay or are hardly measurable at all. The more important it is, to have figures, which impacts certain farming practices may have.
In addition, policy-makers and administrations are challenged by estimating rates for supporting the use of digital technologies in agriculture as well as the effects of employment structures in rural areas.
Against this background, independent quantitative and qualitative assessments of the multiple costs and benefits and potential sustainability gains of digital technologies are essential. It is also important to make those assessment results of possible effects of digital technologies feasible, assessable and usable, particularly for farmers, their advisors, and policy-makers, as it may form a stepping stone to facilitate the uptake of digital technologies in the sector and may facilitate the design of tailored policy measures.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Demonstration of the costs and benefits for farmers/farms of the use of digital technologies for individual production steps (e.g. in per ha calculations and livestock surveillance) as well as for following a “whole-farm approach” which is applied, e.g. in the use of some Farm Management Systems under real testing conditions and with quantitative and qualitative assessments.
Analyses and developed assessment approaches representative for the EU under consideration of the various biogeographical conditions, and several types of farms and farmers under consideration of different business models, e.g. cooperative purchase of equipment, use of contractor services etc.
Stock-taking of results of former or still ongoing Horizon 2020 projects falling directly or indirectly under the scope of this theme, e.g. Smart-AKIS[1], to capitalise those findings and draw lessons learnt.
Provision of innovative decision-making support on the selection and use of digital technologies.
Generation of information and knowledge for the design of policy measures.
Recommendations, under which conditions/ in which way digital technologies deliver best results for a farmer and on business models for financing/ for financing their use.
Generation of innovative tools making the results of the projects easily accessible and usable for the different target groups (at least farmers and advisors), e.g. cost calculators.
Facilitated qualitative and quantitative assessment of the (positive and negative) environmental effects (e.g. reduction of inputs/ emissions) of the use of digital technologies in agriculture.
Projects are expected to foster the development of capacities for assessing the contribution of agriculture to sustainability ambitions through the development of assessment approaches, analyses, and knowledge generation on the impacts, especially the costs, benefits and potential sustainability gains and losses, through the application of digital technologies. Projects are expected to make a significant contribution to establish a basis for the development, implementation and evaluation of sustainability- and data-related policies at regional, national and EU level and reaching related objectives, including Green Deal ambitions, CAP, the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, and Sustainable Finance.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Testing of digital technologies in agriculture under real production conditions.
Consideration of farmers´/ producers´/ contractors´ behaviour.
Representativeness of analyses and developed assessment approaches for the EU and associated countries for several types of farms and farmers.
Links to relevant EU policy monitoring and evaluations and statistical systems.
Exploration of the potential of digital technologies use in agriculture as means for independent monitoring.
Recommendations under which conditions/ in which way digital technologies deliver best sustainability performance.
Tools developed within the project(s) are to be linkable to Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems in Member States.
The multi-actor approach must be implemented, involving at least scientists and representatives of the agricultural sector. They are encouraged to envisage collaboration with Digital Innovation Hubs[2] supported under the Digital Europe Programme is regarded as beneficial for the overall results of the projects.
If involving machinery companies, selected projects should build their work on digital technologies and machinery from at least three companies and brands.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will ensure that the approach proposed will be compatible with and improve the tools used at the European Commission.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In support of the Green Deal, CAP and farm to fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on knowledge sharing in a language that is easy to understand and is targeted to farmers and foresters. Primary producers have a particular need for impartial and tailored knowledge on the management choices related to the needs, challenges or opportunities they experience. This speeds up innovation and the uptake of results, and is key to improve sustainability. It adds value to the knowledge and cost-effectiveness of innovative practices and techniques in and across primary production sectors, food systems, bioeconomy and biodiversity. This will lead to more informed and engaged stakeholders and users of project results including primary producers and consumers thanks to effective platforms such as Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS[1]).
Despite the continued funding of scientific projects, innovative ideas and methods from practice are not captured and spread, and often research findings are not integrated into agricultural and forestry practice. Proposals, acting at EU level to remedy this, are essential because national and sectoral AKISs are insufficiently connected and organised to fully meet the challenge of intensifying thematic cooperation between researchers, advisors and farmers/foresters. This exchange of knowledge will foster economically viable and sustainable agriculture and forestry and build trust between the main AKIS actors. It will scale up local solutions up to the EU level and may even influence policy design wherever useful.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
The collection and distribution of easily accessible practice-oriented knowledge on the thematic area chosen, in particular the existing best practices and research findings that are ready to be put into practice, but not sufficiently known or used by practitioners.
The conservation of practical knowledge for the long term - beyond the project period – in particular by using the main trusted dissemination channels that farmers/foresters consult most often, delivering as much audio-visual material and as many “practice abstracts” in the common European innovation partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) format as possible, including also education and training materials.
Increasing the flow of practical information between farmers/foresters in the EU in a geographically balanced way, creating spill-overs and taking account of the differences between territories. In order to better reach and capture knowledge from the targeted farmers/foresters, the networks may organise 'cross-fertilisation' through sub-networks covering, for example, a region, a language or a production system.
Achieving greater user acceptance of collected solutions and a more intensive dissemination of existing knowledge, by connecting actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up innovation and promote the faster and wider co-creation and transposition of innovative solutions into practice.
The cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[2], as well as contributing to the European Green deal and Farm to Fork objectives. Examples are climate issues, pesticide use, water use and pollution, short supply chains linking to the consumer, farm viability, animal welfare, generational renewal, and much more.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following activities:
Tackling the most urgent needs of farmers and foresters by building on the experience and outcomes of at least 5 EIP-AGRI[3] Operational Groups of at least 3 Member States, scaling it up at European level choosing a related common theme on which to collect, summarise, share and translate the existing knowledge from science and practice in an easy-to-understand way for practitioners.
Compiling a comprehensive description of the state of current farming and forestry practices on the chosen theme with a view to explain the added-value of the proposal and the relevance of the theme. Proposals must pay attention to the cost/benefit aspects of the practices collected and summarised, and clarify how the project avoids duplication with ongoing or completed projects and networks.
Delivering an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing end-user material for farmers and foresters. This info should be easy to access and understand, and feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by farmers and foresters in the countries.
All materials should also be provided in the common EIP-AGRI format to the EIP-AGRI as 'practice abstracts', as well as to the national/regional/local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24) in the requested formats.
Besides giving the details about the EIP-AGRI Operational Groups which are involved[4], wherever possible and relevant to the chosen theme, provide also details on how further synergies shall be built with running and future EIP-AGRI Operational Groups and interactive innovation groups operating in the context of the EIP-AGRI.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach', with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge in particular activating farmers/foresters, farmers' groups and advisors and run for minimum three years.

In support of the Green Deal, common agricultural policy and farm to fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on appropriate management of data and information derived from different sources that are readily available. The expected outcome of this topic is to multiply the use of practice-oriented knowledge, build capacities and to demonstrate innovative solutions to accelerate the transition to a sustainable management and use of natural resources in farming and forestry. This will lead to more informed and engaged stakeholders and users of project results including primary producers and consumers thanks to effective platforms such as Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS[1]).
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
1. Making information and knowledge readily available and easy accessible to farmers, foresters, advisors and other users[2] of practice-ready knowledge. This will support the policy objectives linked to Cluster 6, such as the European Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy and the CAP, the biodiversity strategy and the wider bioeconomy research and policies by supporting the transition process across the EU in new and coherent ways;
2. The CAP cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[3]. This project will provide overall support related to concrete practice-oriented knowledge co-creation, the (digital) organisation of it and the sharing of approaches to do so among Member States;
3. The outcomes will be connecting actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up innovation and the sharing of knowledge, in particular by:
(a) creating added value by better linking research, education, advisors and farming practice to trusted information sources and encouraging the wider use of available knowledge and innovation;
(b) connecting innovation actors and projects; resulting in faster and wider co-creation and transposition of innovative solutions into practice and communicating to the scientific community about the research needs of practice.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following activities:
Collect and enable sharing – as a minimum – of the outcomes of all multi-actor projects from Horizon 2020 and those from Horizon Europe, and of all EIP-AGRI Operational Group innovative projects 2014-2020 and of those to come in the 2021-2027 period. This should be done by developing, operating and fine-tuning the use of an open access and open source digital EU-wide knowledge reservoir for practice interoperable with the European innovation partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI). The knowledge reservoir should be refined to make the tool as interactive and interoperable as possible with Member States’ growing number of websites and knowledge reservoirs for agriculture and forestry practice, and integrate as much as possible practice-oriented project outcomes from any other funding source. Where needed, this may entail policy dialogues and small studies;
Develop this tool, which is to be owned and exploited by the EU, enabling it to serve the knowledge interactions within the EIP-AGRI network, in particular with a view to explore how to encourage emergence of new EIP-AGRI innovation projects by connecting projects and actors. To this end, the project should collaborate with the EIP-AGRI networks at Member State and at EU level;
Share the output of the EU knowledge reservoir as widely as possible, using existing dissemination channels for farmers and foresters and national/regional/local AKIS channels, with the support of AKIS coordination bodies and platforms in Member States. Explore the possibilities for translation of its content into EU languages;
Develop interactive communication activities on the outcomes of clusters of projects in the reservoir, so that the knowledge comes to life through workshops and encounters between AKIS’ actors, in particular those who have common interests across the EU. This will be the way to find out whether the knowledge reservoir meets end-users’ expectations. Through peer-to-peer activities and mixed actor events on dedicated parts of the content of the knowledge reservoir, enable innovations to arise from existing work, using the inputs and suggestions received from key actors all over the EU;
Use the collected material to develop educational material for students, farmers, foresters, advisors and others[4], and for encouraging on-farm demonstrations. Give input for training of advisors and farmers (or other users). All this material is to be exploited across Europe through real life, one-to-one and virtual activities;
The project should collaborate with all 27 EU Member States’ AKIS’ coordinating bodies[5] and related networks, and strongly connect to the EIP-AGRI at EU level. Make use of the AKIS coordination in each Member State to connect actors all over Europe working on specific subjects. This collaboration should serve to verify whether the reservoir indeed meets the expectations of Member States’ AKIS’ actors;
Make use of local connections in all 27 EU Member States to interpret the national/regional contexts, including in particular the innovation strand of national CAP Networks. Use the knowledge and innovation experts in the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group to discuss the project strategy and progress at the various stages of the project;
Projects should have a minimum duration of 7 years, and build on the developments of the projects EURAKNOS[6] and EUREKA[7], and - if relevant - of similar international initiatives. They must implement the multi-actor approach, including as a minimum the EIP-AGRI and national CAP networks and AKIS actors from many Member States as well as IT-experts with experience in knowledge reservoirs. Proposals should include tasks to collaborate with these Horizon 2020 projects to take over the agreed IT standards and languages according to the outcomes of the feasibility discussions in EURAKNOS and EUREKA.

In support of the Green Deal, CAP and farm to fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on appropriate governance to interlink Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS[1]) actors and connect them with practice-oriented information derived from different sources that are readily available. The expected outcome of this topic is to develop sound AKIS governance in Member States. Member States’ authorities and AKIS actors need insights and tools to advance knowledge exchange, build capacities. Innovative governance solutions should accelerate the transition to a more sustainable management and use of natural resources in farming and forestry. This will lead to better informed and engaged stakeholders and users of innovative project results thanks to effective AKIS and related platforms.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Member States need to find new ways to govern the transition process and at the same time modernise governance. Special attention shall go into making information and knowledge more readily available and accessible and to improving knowledge flows between AKIS actors, as foreseen in the AKIS strategies of the post 2020 Common Agricultural Policy[2]. The task of the future AKIS coordination bodies and platforms is to find adequate governance to share knowledge and innovation supporting the European Green Deal and farm to fork objectives, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals while trying to solve institutional barriers and lock-ins, political inertia and power imbalances.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes
1. New know-how to be used by policy makers and other AKIS actors[3] to improve knowledge flows and develop a well-functioning AKIS in their country. This supports policy objectives linked to Cluster 6, such as the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Common Agricultural Policy. Examples are farm viability and generational renewal, agro-ecology, climate mitigation and adaptation, pesticide reduction, reduction of water use and pollution, and much more.
2. The CAP post 2020 cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[4] . Support related to knowledge creation, organisation and sharing will become available under the post 2020 CAP. This project must help Member States to benchmark among them in order to choose the most effective AKIS interventions adapted to their local/regional/national situations. It should improve learning on how to organise their AKIS to improve its functioning.
3. The outcomes should be approaches to better connect actors, policies and projects and instruments to speed up innovation and the uptake of knowledge, in particular to:
(a) create added value by better linking research, education, advisors and farming practice and encourage the wider use of available knowledge and innovation;
(b) connect innovation actors and projects at all levels; resulting in faster and wider co-creation and transposition of innovative solutions into practice and communicate to the scientific community the research needs of practice.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following activities:
Compare the various types of AKIS[5] within the EU at national, regional and local level to discover how they effectively and efficiently enhance interaction between AKIS actors through activities at various geographical levels. Special attention shall be paid to making practice-oriented information and knowledge better available, shared and accessible and on how to improve knowledge flows between AKIS actors, including informing research on needs from practice and finding ways to reward scientists for results useable in practice in particular. Project activities should help learning processes for practitioners within the country and regions, as well as support them to benefit from well-functioning AKISs. Project proposals must also support development of various cross-border approaches between AKISs to enhance knowledge flows and initiatives to incentivise innovation projects among countries and regions within the EU, and to learn from each other.
A specific part of the project should be dedicated to sharing the various ways and good examples of how advisors can be intensively integrated in AKIS[6] , including for innovation support[7].
Assess current AKIS, using practical tools and indicators capable of monitoring the functioning of Member States’ AKIS. This should include institutional arrangements and ways to stimulate researchers to exchange information with practice and have an effective impact on the transition to a more sustainable agriculture by adjusting the focus of their research to more practical approaches and interaction with practice. Provide advice and support on how to measure improving the functioning of the AKIS, making use of a coherent and effective approach while taking into account the national/regional/local historical and cultural contexts.
Provide all outcomes and materials to the European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI), including in the common 'practice abstract' format for EU wide dissemination, as well as to national/regional/local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24) in the requested formats.
Cover all 27 EU Member State in the project, and make use in all those countries of experts who understand and are able to make an accurate interpretation of the national/regional contexts of practitioners. Use the knowledge and innovation experts in the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group to discuss the project’s strategy and progress in the various stages of the project. Projects should have a minimum duration of 7 years and must implement the multi-actor approach. Since innovation support is an essential element in a well-functioning AKIS, cooperation with the project under HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-26 is expected.

In support of the Green Deal, CAP and farm to fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on advisor exchanges across the EU to increase the speed of knowledge creation and sharing, capacity building, of demonstration of innovative solutions, as well as helping to bring them into practice, which accelerates the needed transitions. Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) in which advisors are fully integrated[1] are key drivers to speed up innovation and the uptake of research results by farmers.
Primary producers have a particular need for impartial, ready-to-use and tailored knowledge on the management choices related to the needs, challenges or opportunities they experience. This speeds up innovation and the uptake of results, and is key to improve sustainability. It adds value to the knowledge and cost-effectiveness of innovative practices and techniques in and across primary production sectors, food systems, bioeconomy and biodiversity. This will lead to more informed and engaged stakeholders and users of project results including primary producers and consumers thanks to effective platforms such as Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems.
Transformative changes such as those required within the European Green Deal are dynamic processes that require appropriate governance of AKIS actors. Advisors are key actors strongly guiding and with powerful influence over producers’ decisions. A novelty in the post-2020 CAP plans[2] is that advisors now must be integrated within the Member States’ AKIS, and that the scope of their actions has become much broader. They must now be able to cover economic, environmental and social domains, as well as be informed on up-to-date science and technology. They should be able to translate this knowledge into opportunities and use and adapt those to specific local circumstances. This specific topic focuses on the important role advisors can play to exploit the potential of connecting consumers with producers through short supply chains, an upcoming issue in the more sustainable and diversified agriculture of the future.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Production of supporting services and sharing of materials to facilitate the upscaling of short supply chains, such as knowledge networks and peer-to-peer counselling, master classes, inspiration tours, advice modelling, communication and education materials, sharing of effective business models and making use of possible accelerators serving both producers and consumers, SWOT analysis schemes, (new) business model analyses, etc
Development of interaction with regional, national and EU policy makers, potentially leading to an EU network to discuss institutional barriers to producer-consumer chains, including bottlenecks, lock-ins, political inertia, ambiguous regulations, inequality between Member States and power imbalances;
The policy objectives linked to Cluster 6, as well as the European Green Deal, and in particular the Farm to Fork Strategy and the Common Agricultural Policy, with the objective to increase farmer viability and raise consumer awareness on connecting producers and consumers in short food supply chains;
The CAP cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[3] . This project shall provide overall support related to knowledge creation, organisation and sharing of novel information across borders. It shall help to fill gaps on emerging advisory topics which is useful in particular in relation with the new obligation for Member States to integrate advisors within their AKIS which shall cover a much broader scope than in the former period;
5. The outcomes should speed up the introduction, spread and bringing into practice of innovative solutions related to consumer-producer chains overall, in particular by:
(a) creating added value by better linking research, education, advisors and farming practice and encouraging the wider use of available knowledge across the EU;
(b) learning from innovation actors and projects, resulting in faster sharing and implementation of ready-to-use innovative solutions, spreading them into practice and communicating to the scientific community the bottom-up research needs of practice.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following activities:
Connect advisors with knowledge on short supply chains who have a broad and extensive network of farmers across all EU Member States into an EU advisory network on short food supply chains to better connect consumers with producers, securing producers’ income, building on the outcomes of the EIP-AGRI Workshop “Cities and Food – Connecting Consumers and Producers” and the Focus Group on Short Food Supply Chains[4].
Share effective and novel short chain approaches and experiences among this EU advisory network. These approaches must be sustainable in terms of economic, environmental and social aspects.
Focus on cost-benefit elements. Collect and document good examples in this regard, connecting with farmers, intermediates and consumers in Member States to be able to take into account financial aspects and local conditions. Select the best practices, learn about the key success factors, possible quick wins and make them available for (local) exploitation, to ensure financial win-wins for producers and consumers.
Integrate the advisors of the EU short food supply chain network into the Member States’ AKIS as much as possible. They can provide encouragement as innovation brokers in local short chain projects of European innovation partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) Operational Groups. They should give hands-on training to farmers and local advisors, lead national thematic and learning networks on the subject, deliver and implement action plans with interested farmers, inspire new and incoming farmers or farms at the cross-roads of intergenerational renewal, connect with education and ensure broad communication, support peer-to-peer consulting, develop on-farm demonstrations and YouTube demo films, and provide specific back-office support for generalist advisors within the national/regional AKIS.
Explore if the some or all activities of the EU advisory network on short supply chains can be upscaled at the level of a number of Member States under a cooperative format. Wherever possible, develop digital advisory and accelerator tools for common and open use across the EU. Determine whether common instruments can be created to incentivise the implementation of short food supply chains linking producers with consumers, for instance in the framework of smart villages, or to incentivise novel food strategies for cities, villages and rural areas, etc.
Include all 27 EU Member States in the EU advisory network. Make use in all those countries of experts who understand and are able to make an accurate interpretation of the national / regional contexts to help develop the best solutions for that Member State or region. Use the support from the knowledge and innovation experts of the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group to discuss project strategies, coordination and progress in the various stages of the 2 projects. Projects should run at least 5 years. They must implement the multi-actor approach.
Provide all outcomes and materials to the EIP-AGRI, including in the common 'practice abstract' format for EU wide dissemination, as well as to national / regional / local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24) in the requested formats.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In support of the Green Deal, common agricultural policy and farm to fork objectives and targets, the successful proposal will focus on how to discover innovative ideas and how to enable the relevant actors to work out these ideas in a co-creative way as from the very start of the making of the proposal. The expected outcome of this topic is to develop sound, coherent and well-prepared innovation generation and support methods, which enable individual grassroots innovative ideas to come to fruition. It should help project coordinators to find methods to use the complementary knowledge of partners to develop ready-to-use solutions. Member States’ authorities and actors of the agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS) need insights and tools to improve the interaction, connections and drafting skills for preparation of innovation project proposals. This will eventually lead to useable and practice-oriented innovative project results, better informed practitioners motivated to implement those results and, as a consequence, increased impact of funding for multi-actor research and innovation and European innovation partnership (EIP) Operational Groups.
Member States AKISs need to be equipped to advance knowledge, build capacities and co-create innovative solutions to accelerate the transition to a sustainable and circular management and use of natural resources. To this end, the CAP post-2020 introduced for all Member States an obligation to have innovation support services in place[1], to speed up innovation by helping to develop individual innovative grassroots ideas into interactive innovation projects[2]. Such services can serve as one stop shops for innovation and should help future users of project results to prepare multi-actor innovative projects with a view to testing the potential innovation they have in mind. Member States need to find new ways to organise innovation support which fuels the generation of solutions for the transition process towards more sustainable farming and forestry. This can be done in particular in the form of a one-stop-shop for innovation, which can provide practical information on the subject of the potential project, existing scientific knowledge and project management as well as tips and tricks on how to develop such projects into a coherent project proposal. Being able to connect the most relevant actors with complementary knowledge is also an essential element, and will help to attain the objectives of the potential project. Deepening innovation support will need to take into account institutional barriers and lock-ins, political inertia and tackle power imbalances between potential actors involved in co-creative innovation processes.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
1. Helping innovation support services to tackle innovative ideas related to the policy objectives linked to Cluster 6, such as farm viability, agro-ecology, climate issues, pesticide reduction, reduction of water use and pollution, short supply chains, generational renewal, etc, as well as the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy and the CAP, the Biodiversity Strategy and the wider bioeconomy research and policies.
2. Contribute to the CAP cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake[3] . Projects shall provide overall support to generate practical approaches ultimately leading to better capturing of emerging needs and/or innovative opportunities, knowledge co-creation, in relation to the new obligation for Member States under the CAP post-2020[4] to have innovation support services in place, taking into account national and regional contexts.
3. The outcomes shall connect actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up creation of innovative solutions, in particular by:
(a) creating added value by better linking research, education, advisors and farming practice and encouraging the wider use of available knowledge which can serve the innovative idea;
(b) connecting innovation actors and projects; resulting in faster co-creation of ready-to-use innovative solutions, spreading them into practice and communicating the research needs of practice to the scientific community.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following activities:
Develop approaches to set up and improve the functioning of innovation brokers, which have the capacities to find individual innovative grassroots ideas at an early stage as well as practice needs or innovative opportunities. These innovative ideas should then be developed with the support of the owner of the idea and a number of relevant actors with complementary knowledge into an EIP-AGRI interactive innovation project510, using methods ensuring co-ownership of the initiators and partners in the project. Seed funding as used for EIP-AGRI Operational Group projects is often a good solution to accompany this process, but also other approaches such as “innovation advice” or “innovation coaching” are an option to investigate[5].
Explore how such innovation support approaches could be embedded in the national/regional AKIS, in particular through useful connections with advisors, and how they can be linked to other broader innovation support mechanisms, including research, advisors and CAP networks at Member State or regional level[6].
Investigate and compare among Member States how the governance of such innovation support could be organised at the level of the managing authorities (single “one-stop-shop” service or mixed model with several smaller and/or bigger innovation support services, or…) taking into account the great variety of contexts in Member States and regions.
Cover all 27 EU Member States in the project to ensure learning from diversity. Make use in all those countries of experts who understand and are able to make an accurate interpretation of the national/regional contexts and its impact to help develop the ideal solution for that Member State.
Projects should have a minimum duration of 6 years, investing most in the very first years, and use the support from the knowledge and innovation experts of the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group to discuss project strategy and progress in the various stages of the project. They must implement the multi-actor approach, including existing experienced innovation support services as partners which can share their methods and help develop solutions in other contexts.
As foreseen in the Multi-Actor Approach requirements[7], provide all outcomes and materials to the European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI), including in the common 'practice abstract' format for EU wide dissemination, including as well as to national/regional/local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24) in the requested formats.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Today, process industry operations for downstream processing represent on average 50-60% of the total capital (CAPEX) and operating costs (OPEX) and they account for up to 45% of the process energy in industrial operations. These high costs for downstream processing are often linked to the inefficiencies in the upstream process, due to low conversion and formation of co-products, by-products and/or impurities. Hybrid processing technologies (including chemical and biochemical steps) can provide major advantages in terms of primary process selectivity and sustainability. However, they have not been widely deployed in industry so far. The development of novel technologies for upstream and downstream unit operations, as well as their better integration, could provide significant resource and energy efficiency gains.
Scope:
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to provide novel solutions for a deeper integration of upstream and downstream processing operations. Proposals should consider:
Intensified process technologies presenting multistep upstream processes, potentially exploiting hybrid chemo and bio catalytic technologies as well as process analytical techniques (PAT), in order to maximise production efficiency, selectivity and mitigation of downstream processing;
Complex downstream operations, integrating different separation techniques and purification steps;
Modularity and flexibility of the solutions, as well as, potential for transition from batch to continuous operations;
The technologies proposed should enable increased productivity, purity and quality of products, while lowering the process environmental footprint and increasing resource and energy efficiency;
The potential for integration in the current industrial scenario, and the replicability of the concept in different sectors of the process industry;
Increased safety of the work environment.
Proposals should provide proof of economic and industrial feasibility of the technologies involved; and should consider the potential integration in existing installations, as well as their retrofitting. Reduction of production costs and time to market is also expected.
Significant demonstration activities in industrial environments are expected. Demonstration activities in real industrial settings, showing the potential for integration into existing plants and industrial operations, represent a clear added-value to the proposals.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 10 and 14 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
20% decrease in greenhouse gas emission;
Increased in resource and energy efficiency by at least 20%;
Novel modular and scalable integrated (upstream-downstream) pilot line technologies with 10% decrease in CAPEX and OPEX;
Effective dissemination of major innovation outcomes to the current and next generation of employees, through the development of learning resources with flexible usability. These should be ready to be easily integrated in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Process industry plants have to be operated for a long time to make their operations viable. They include equipment such as furnaces, reactors, raw materials handling and storage systems which sometimes have a lifetime beyond 30 years. Keeping these facilities up to date from a technological and from regulatory point of view (for instance related to zero waste regulations and to the circular economy) is a major challenge. Even industrial plants which are less than 10 years old, are often not equipped for new or renewable (e.g. biomass) materials and alternative or renewable energy input streams. More generally, this increased variety of inputs along with the need for energy efficiency improvements poses a real challenge and requires technological breakthroughs in the process industry.
Scope:
Proposals need to cover the following:
Implement simulation models and decision support tools for the production chain in an energy intensive sector, including the detection of inefficiencies, in order to allow flexibility with respect to feedstock of variable composition, while offering energy efficiency and product quality;
The development of tools and methodologies to streamline and support retrofitting;
Find the most efficient operational input conditions to optimise the performances;
Develop indicators to modify input variables and its potential of replication across the industry;
Facilitate and adapt the equipment towards a larger number and more diverse feedstock in order to be ready for a transition in which variability in quality, quantity and price of feedstock are key to make the production competitive and sustainable;
Solutions should demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of the concepts of retrofitting at industrial scale.
Demonstration of the technology in different process industries should be undertaken, covering both the technology (new ‘plug-ins’), as well as the process control (higher variability of the process requires new Monitoring & Control Systems).
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 8 and 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
As an exception from General Annex D, the funding rate for eligible costs in grants awarded under this topic will be differentiated: 100% of the eligible costs for beneficiaries and linked third parties that are non-profit legal entities; and 50% of the eligible costs for beneficiaries and linked third parties that are for profit legal entities.
Expected Impact:
Increasing the resource and energy efficiency of the targeted processes by 20%;
Decrease GHG emissions through retrofitting by at least 30%;
Decreased utilisation of fossil resources in the process industry of at least 20%;
Reduced OPEX by 30% and increased productivity by 20%;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy-intensive industries are major users of fresh water, for e.g. processing, washing, diluting, heating, cooling, and transporting products. Since fresh water is a scare resource, breakthrough innovations are needed in energy-intensive industries to recycle water and create closed loops in industrial processes. Such closed loops would significantly reduce the use of fresh water and improve water availability in the relevant EU water catchment areas, as outlined in the Water Framework Directive, for other purposes (adjacent communities, farming and bio-based industries). Industrial symbiosis offers the potential for energy, water and other resource efficiency at a scale beyond energy intensive industries.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at near-zero discharge using closed-loop systems in combination with recovery of energy and/or substances (resources) through the development of integrated water-smart strategies for industrial processes.
Strategies should take into account:
Better characterising the water usage and production in the industrial processes;
Defining recycling options with a combined water, waste and energy approach in an integrative system design method considering investment and optimal operations;
Future production demand through design, control options, and technologies integration that reduce water consumption, recycle water, and reduce the use of fresh water resources in closed-loop industrial processes including cascading use of different kinds of water in industrial settlements or for compatible re-use in urban and rural areas.
Reprograming of water resources and optimisation of water management in industrial processes should apply the principles of waste - water - energy design in a circular context.
Proposals should develop new technologies and approaches at a large scale. It is anticipated to combine:
Real time smart monitoring and management systems with innovative digital solutions for sensors and actuators (e.g. modelling and artificial intelligence) and;
Recycling technologies such as highly selective separation or extraction processes and new solutions for water treatment to prevent fouling and corrosion.
Integrated Water Management should consider different qualities and sources of water, including desalination, re-use of treated wastewater, rainwater harvesting and gas humidity condensation (e.g., cooling tower blowdown). Development of `tailor-made' system solutions with demand orientation and scale-up testing to robust industrial processes will be required. Water re-use will subsequently lead to accumulation of pollutants. In-line monitoring should include these water quality control parameters linked to the process.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call, and with other relevant projects, in particular those selected under SC5-04-2019 “Building a water-smart economy and society”, is strongly encouraged.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction of this part of the Work Programme.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 8 and 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Several of the following impacts are expected:
Significant reduction of the current use of fresh water resources;
Significant steps towards near-zero discharge using closed-loop systems in industrial processes;
Significant increase of the recovery of water, energy and/or substances and materials;
Increase of resource and water efficiency by 30% compared to the state-of-the-art;
Effective dissemination of major innovation outcomes to the current and next generation of employees, through the development of learning resources with flexible usability. These should be easy to integrate in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes;
The environmental gains in absolute figures, and weighted against EU and global environmental footprints, should be demonstrated;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy intensive industries in Europe depend on the one hand on very large volumes of minerals and other raw materials (e.g. 70% of process manufacturing depends on minerals and metals). On the other hand, they heavily rely on imports from third countries (extraction in Europe covers only 29% of the demand). The environmental footprint of high-volume products is also too high. The challenge is to develop technologies for the uptake of secondary raw materials based on industrial symbiosis, waste collection, or water treatment systems, and leading to new value chains or even value loops (i.e. reusing waste, by-products and recycled materials repeatedly) instead of just further optimising existing processes. Such new technologies should enable overcoming barriers such as low costs of primary raw materials or differences in taxes across countries and regions (e.g. landfilling taxes for primary and secondary raw materials).
Scope:
Proposals should address the development of new high volume value loops and integrated supply chains through industrial processes enabling the cross-sectorial, symbiotic, use of mineral waste, by-products and end-of-life materials from other industry sectors. The secondary materials can be used either as raw material for the production process or can be introduced in a subsequent process step to an intermediate product where they become a constituent of the final product. Composition variability of wastes or by-products can be addressed either by purification processes prior to production, or within the production process.
The following aspects should also be considered:
Product specifications according to customer expectations (e.g. durability, versatility, quality, traceability), clearly shown by involving relevant actors in the value chain;
Economic viability of the proposed processes together with potential new business concepts and simplified methodologies;
Regulatory aspects such as transport and use of secondary material in new products put on the market.
Information guides should be provided before the end of the project. These should address elements covering the quality of information from product manufacturers, for the efficient use of secondary materials (beneficiation, quality concepts, test procedures, applications and training) and facilitate decision making.
Proof of concept should be delivered at pilot or demo scale (excluding commercially usable prototypes) to demonstrate convincingly scalability towards industrial applications. Projects are encouraged to develop advanced modelling tools or to use them to build dedicated pilot installations.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction of this part of the Work Programme.

Several of the following impacts are expected:
Reduction potential of at least 30% of primary raw material use per ton of main high volume final product;
Reduction of waste generation by at least 25%;
Significant energy savings and reductions in CO2 emissions (including through a higher share of renewable energy) in the overall sustainable production lines in which the technology is fully integrated;
Secure and sustainable provision of secondary resources at total cost lower than existing solutions;
Contribution to new standards for the use of secondary materials for new products;
Effective dissemination of major innovation outcomes to the current and next generation of employees, through the development of learning resources with flexible usability. These should be easily integrable in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Plastics materials are produced mainly from raw materials of fossil origin (e.g. PE, PP, and PET). A variety of bio-based plastic materials are increasingly available. Plastic materials are used in a wide range of applications because of their properties, versatility, lightweight and price, for example for making lightweight polymer composites to substitute metals and in more traditional applications, such as packaging. The wide use of these materials results in a huge amount of plastic waste. Recycling and redesign of plastics are essential in reusing plastic waste material and avoiding landfill. This also allows utilising plastics as carbon sinks in an optimal way, before using them for energy recovery at the end of life. A major challenge lies in the development of process technologies, utilising plastic waste as starting material (at least in part). A better use of underexploited resource (plastic waste) for the production of added value products (not restricted to plastics but excluding fuels) and process streams would support the circular economy.
Scope:
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to cover processes for the production of recyclable materials containing plastics. Aspects to be considered are:
Improved energy and resource efficiency. The processes proposed are expected to have a lower environmental footprint compared to the current state of the art for the production of added value products; this should be proved by Life Cycle Assessment as well as Life Cycle Cost to prove the economic viability of the proposed technology;
Integration with the relevant value chains, ensuring the secure supply of the raw material streams. In this respect, a clear strategy to involve the relevant actors along the value chain is expected;
Process flexibility and ability to utilise waste heterogeneous plastic materials, including plastic composites, as input to allow the recycling and the re-processing of this widely available resource into added value products (excluding fuels). Sustainable raw materials, such as bio-based raw materials and organic waste could also be considered;
Key issues related to the quality of the raw (including secondary) material streams should be covered, and in particular the heterogeneity of the waste plastic material, as well as the wide variety of substances contained in plastic materials (e.g. plasticisers, anti-oxidants, etc.). The valorisation of fillers or fibres from composites should also be covered;
Quality/specifications of the yielded streams ensuring their usability by downstream industries;
Non-technological hurdles, such as regulations and standards, to enable the prompt deployment in industry of the developed concepts and economic indicators (e.g. CAPEX and OPEX).
Demonstration activities, prototypes and pilot implementations in real industrial settings for the concepts proposed are expected.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Regions are key players in the transition to a circular economy and can together create new circular economy value chains with critical mass. However, knowledge of each other's strengths and the available resources and services is often limited. Developing joint strategies, built on complementarities and respective strengths, can therefore be valuable for better realising their individual and combined potential.
Scope:
The purpose is to support a transition towards the circular economy in European regions in synergy with Smart Specialisation strategies. A systemic approach should be adopted that seeks connections between sectors, value chains, markets, natural resources and relevant societal actors. The project should develop a coherent EU reference framework enabling and encouraging regions and Member States to establish operational synergies between R&I investments from Horizon 2020 and the European Structural and Investment Funds leading to market uptake and replication of innovative solutions. The developed reference framework should include recommendations for policy makers, in particular in EU Cohesion countries, providing guidance on how to invest European Structural and Investment Funds to support the transition to a circular economy within the context of existing smart specialisation strategies.
Participants must be regional authorities and/or national/regional/local structures responsible for the implementation of Smart Specialisation strategies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Realisation of complementarities between existing smart specialisation strategies of a sufficient number of regions, addressing all of the following elements:
identification of concrete sectors or areas with high potential to support a transition to a circular economy, within a European reference framework;
investment needs per region and sector/area to enhance existing smart specialisation strategies of involved regions;
operational actions to connect the activities of the identified sectors/areas of involved regions in view of trans-national cooperation along relevant value chains;
development of policy support advisory services that enable regions to invest EU funds to leapfrog to circular economy solutions in achieving compliance with EU objectives and targets.
Such cooperation in the implementation of smart specialisation strategies should lead to a measurable transition towards a circular economy within the identified sectors/areas, in the regions and Member States involved. The transition can be measured in, for example: application of new business models; application of adjusted value or production chains; application of new product and/or service design; or 30% increase in resource efficiency."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European industrial competitiveness in Earth observation depends on the availability of demonstrated/validated systems and sub-systems for operational and advanced missions in the commercial and institutional domain, but also on the readiness in the emerging market for innovative missions relying on small and very small systems (constellation, formation flying and fractionated instruments).
The specific challenge, for the mid-term is to bring the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) forward for a number of Earth observation technologies and to ensure the readiness of European solutions to propose and support new mission concepts taking advantage of nano-, micro- and mini-satellites.
In recent years small satellites have become more attractive due to lower development costs and shorter lead times. There is a natural trade-off to be made between spacecraft size and functionality, but advances in both miniaturization and integration technologies have diminished the scope of that trade-off.
Moreover, within the context of preparatory work for the next generation of the Copernicus space component, mission concepts will be developed by European industry based on mature Earth observation technologies and solutions.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to demonstrate, in a relevant environment, technologies, systems and sub-systems for Earth observation. Proposals should address and demonstrate significant improvements in such areas as miniaturisation, power reduction, efficiency, versatility, and/or increased functionality and should demonstrate complementarity to activities already funded by Member States and the European Space Agency.
Proposals that develop technologies targeting TRL 6, or lower TRLs, are welcome.
Proposals are sought with relevance in the domain of technology development for space in the fields of:
Optical technologies for high precision sensing, including high stability structures, stable and lightweight mirrors, large focal planes, adaptive optics and wave front error (WFE) control techniques.
Detector technology and complete detection chain enhancement in the domains of CMOS and Infrared for Earth observations in orbit aiming at higher spatial or spectral resolution and performance.
Sensors and mission concepts delivering high accuracy parameters for emission measurements, particularly of climate change determining Greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane. High performance miniaturised optical and SAR sensors for Earth observation in support of the hydrological cycle modelling and prediction, and accurate weather forecast.
Active antennas for radar - exploring lower (P and S) and higher (X and Ka) frequency ranges - Transmit/Receive Modules (TRMs), digital beam-forming and waveform generation, large deployable reflectors.
Sensors, actuators and control technologies for high precision Attitude and Orbital Control Systems (AOCS), in particular for small satellites, and Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC).
Technologies to advance in fractionated systems and formation flying for Earth Observation.
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposals must describe how the proposed developments will contribute to strengthening Europe's position in industrial competitiveness in technologies for Earth observation payloads and mission, despite the target platform size and scalability.
The technologies to be addressed in the proposals should represent significant improvements compared to existing Earth observation missions in terms of capability, precision, efficiency or other characteristics, opening new avenues for future space systems.
Substantially improved in-depth state-of-the-art technologies in key areas such as optical and radar systems, sounders, lidars and detectors for Earth observation.
Greater industrial relevance of research actions and output as demonstrated by deeper involvement of industry, including SMEs, and stronger take-up of research results.

Furthermore, electric propulsion will have implications on several aspects of space systems, such as the need to increase on-board power supply capabilities, which may be addressed in future calls of this SRC.
Scope:
A ‘disruptive space technology’ is an emerging technology that disrupts the status quo of the space sector by replacing the dominant technology and provides a radical improvement in performance that is perceived as valuable by a customer or part of the market, or it opens up new opportunities not possible with the incumbent technology. If a disruptive technology can be identified early enough, accelerating the development of that technology would help sustain advances in performance. Emerging technologies that are potentially ‘disruptive’ often underperform compared to the dominant technology in early development phases – the underlying physics may not be fully understood for example and more R&D is required to properly ascertain performance attributes.
This topic focuses on promoting promising and potentially disruptive concepts in the field of Electric Propulsion, in order to allow the increase of the currently low or very low TRL of breakthrough concepts which in the long term could change the EP landscape.
Proposals are expected in the areas of disruptive technologies for Electric Propulsion and for EP thrusters, that are currently at low TRL (≤ 4) and not part of the incremental lines mentioned above. Indicatively, these disruptive technologies are based on Helicon Plasma Thrusters (HPT), Electron Cyclotron Resonance plasma thrusters (ECR), Magneto Plasma Dynamic thrusters (MPD), pulsed plasma thrusters (PPT), micro-propulsion electric thrusters. This list is non-exhaustive and any other innovative electric thruster concepts and relevant technologies for disruptive electric propulsion systems not mentioned here can be addressed (e.g. direct drive, radical new PPU architectures, dedicated spacecraft power system architectures and/or materials).
Proposals for disruptive technologies shall not address incremental thruster technologies (e.g. micro-GIE, etc.).
A detailed description of the above lines is included in the corresponding guidelines[2].
Proposals should also include a validation plan, including one or more validation methods to apply through the course of the project, which would allow to verify how the development targets are being met and how the landscape disruption shall take place in the future. These plans should be analysed in depth through a dedicated work package within the project.
A maximum of one proposal addressing transversal relevant technologies for disruptive Electric propulsion systems (not thrusters), and a maximum of 4 proposals addressing the remaining ones devoted to specific disruptive EP thrusters will be selected.
The Commission considers that proposals for the disruptive technologies requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to each other and complementary to grants awarded under sub-topic COMPET-3-2016-a (""complementary grants"").

Expected Impact:
To anticipate, in the long-term, the necessary evolutions in order to maintain the European capacity to compete in the worldwide arena of electric propulsion satellites, by providing Europe with competitive and innovative EP products in the long-term.
To promote and accelerate the development of potentially breakthrough EP or EP-related concepts in order to be able to provoke a disruption in the propulsion landscape in the long-term

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Satellite missions with higher productivity add growing data requirements on missions. As a result high speed data handling, processing and transfer are required. These growing requirements are shared among a variety of applications, with a main focus on Earth observation and Telecommunication systems, and with applications also in Science and Exploration. Data challenges have to be addressed within the data chain on-board the satellites (e.g. processing, storage, compression, optimisation), between the satellite and other terminals that can be located on ground or air-borne platforms, on-board other satellites, and mission ground segment. In particular, next generation Earth observation sensors pose the most challenging requirements for data links (in the Gbps range), including links from orbit to ground and inter-satellite communications between different orbits and constellations, and including technology transfer related to very small LEO satellites (nano and cubesats), as well as direct ground link to very small LEO satellites (nanosat and below, including cubesats) considering optical technologies.
Faster processing, larger storage, and high bandwidth transmissions to users will be needed. Moreover, smart on-board data compression and optimisation will become a growing necessity. All these improvements will be required to efficiently support the next generation of data intensive missions. To support this future scenario, innovations must be brought to the payload data management system (including data optimisation processes), to inter-satellite links, to satellite-ground communication, and to the ground segment data handling system.
Moreover, within the context of preparatory work for the next generation of the Copernicus space component, mission concepts will be developed by European industry based on mature Earth observation technologies and solutions.
Scope:
Activities shall aim at providing advanced on-board data handling and transfer for Earth observation and Telecommunication systems, and its management and exploitation in mission ground segment. These activities shall address the future challenge of high data rates transmission and significant improvements in data throughput:
Re-configurable high data rate links including high frequency RF bands and optical communications: direct and interoperable links between LEO satellites and links to Earth and mobile or aerial platforms (including X band, Ka band and optical), or direct links between GEO satellites and Earth or mobile or aerial platforms, and inter-satellite links (beyond the specifications of the European Data Relay System – EDRS and its evolution in support to Copernicus).
On-board data processing, implementation of complex data algorithms (e.g. by means of programmable Digital Signal Processors – DSPs).
On-board data compression systems to improve on-board data storage (memory modules for new memory devices).
High data rate image (optical and/or radar) and video processing, such as lossless compression, image enhancement techniques or on-board SAR image generation.
Improved on-board data storage ensuring efficiency and reliability (management of memory modules for new memory devices).
Anticipate how the ground segment will cope with higher data rates to improve the overall data throughput. In particular to address the required evolution of technologies, architectures, products, end-user expectations, including the challenges associated with optical ground stations for data uplink and downlink.
Anticipate the need to link innovative ground segment architectures based on new ICT technologies, including cloud, in the “Big Data” domain and the rise in user demand for wide access to Near Real Time (NRT) and Quasi Real Time (QRT) data in social media and mobile applications.
A maximum of one proposal, exploiting NRT/QRT quality of data, with due regard to interoperability of interfaces to both innovative ICT dissemination architecture and applications, will be selected for funding.
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals addressing the full data chain (processing and compression, storage and transmission), or a coherent part of it, requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 7 million, and proposals addressing the rise in user demand of NRT/QRT data, requesting a contribution of between EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

To provide elements for the high speed data chain management (including processing and compression, storage and transmission) and to support technologies for data intensive next generation of Telecommunications and Earth observation systems.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The overall challenge of this strategic research cluster (SRC) is to enable major advances in space robotic technologies for future on-orbit satellite servicing (robotics and rendezvous), and the exploration of the surfaces of the other bodies in our solar system.
This specific challenge consists of designing, manufacturing and testing of reliable and high performance common robotic building blocks for operation in space environments (orbital and/or planetary), which will be useful for the SRC (demonstrations of on-orbit satellite servicing and planetary surface exploration). It can also be useful for (i) the wider European space robotics goals; and (ii) potential spin-off and spill-over effects to other areas of robotic activity on Earth (such as automotive or underwater but not limited to those).
Through the mastering of common building blocks, which allow inexpensive re-use across multiple applications, European actors will have a competitive advantage and industrial partnering will be facilitated. For the common building blocks to be successful, particular effort must be made in systems engineering, system performance analysis, reliability, availability, maintainability and safety improvement, rather than an approach based on pure technology development.
Scope:
Proposals shall address one of the following six specific robotic building blocks:
a) Space Robot Control Operating System: an open source space robot control operating system (RCOS) that can provide adequate features and performance with space-grade Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) properties. RCOS control any robot/spacecraft systems whether for orbital or planetary applications, for all phases and modes of the mission.
b) Autonomy framework Time/Space/Resources planning and scheduling: a software framework for the development of highly autonomous space robotics missions. In these a robot system, given a high level goal, will (re)plan, schedule and oversee the execution of elementary actions to attain the goal, considering Time/Space/Resources constraints, interleaving planning with execution and providing formal verification capabilities of the functional layer.. The activities will comprise planning/scheduling capabilities to decompose high level commands into sub-tasks; resource management to fulfil in a dynamic way the high level mission/goals; Fault management with reconfiguration capability; Interaction management with other robotic systems to allow cooperation and tasks sharing, guidance, navigation and control to attain execution.
c) Common data fusion framework: a software framework implementing data fusion techniques for various sensors such as LIDAR, Imagers, radar, sonar, IMUs, and sun sensors capable of localising robots in natural and man-made environments, geometrical/topological reconstruction of environment, map making. Robots need to perceive their environment and to understand where they are with respect to their operational goals. No single sensor can convey reliably localisation and mapping information in all conditions of space.
d) Inspection Sensor Suite: a suite of perception sensors that allow localisation and map making for robotic inspection of orbital assets (under space representative conditions and taking into account in-orbit inspection scenario requirements) and for planetary surface exploration. The activities comprise the identification of suitable sensors which may include imaging sensors for inspection operations, stereo imaging sensors, holographic sensors, zoom cameras for inspection and proximity operations, infrared sensors, imaging radar and LIDAR as well as illumination integrated solution considering data processing, realisation of common interfaces for data provision, mechanical and electrical integration.
e) Modular interfaces for Robotic handling of Payloads: a set of interfaces (mechanical, data, electrical, thermal) that allow coupling of payload to robot manipulators and payload to other payload (or to a platform) enabling manipulation of payload by robots in orbital and planetary environment assembly of structures out of elemental blocks, spacecraft deployment aid.
f) Validation Platforms and Field Tests: test vehicles (platforms or facilities) and validation environment for common testing of building blocks reference implementations. Relying upon existing assets, this would include the provision of test means (e.g. rovers, robots, dynamic robotics, RVD facilities), the support for integration in these of common building blocks, instrumentation and the execution of tests in realistic or analogue environments.
A detailed description of the above building blocks is included in the corresponding guidelines[1].
Each common building block shall be validated in a test scenario by means of a reference implementation (the specific prototype).
A minimum of one proposal per building block (a)-(f) will be selected for funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 3.5 million for specific building blocks (a)-(e) and in the range of EUR 1 million for the specific building block (f) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to each other (""complementary grants""). In order to ensure a smooth and successful implementation of this Strategic Research Cluster (SRC), the beneficiaries of complementary grants (""complementary beneficiaries"") shall conclude a written ""collaboration agreement"". The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will apply.
Expected Impact:
For each specific building block, the expected impacts are:
a) Technologies compliant with very high standards of RAMS which can be usable in future space robotics missions;
b) Technologies useful for space robots (especially the planetary ones) requiring autonomy to cope with the potential inability to communicate to the Earth and in terrestrial applications needing autonomy for environmental monitoring and security purposes;
c) Navigation/localisation and map making applications for robots whether in space or on planetary surfaces while coping with the performance and reliability issues of sensors;
d) Availability of a standard reliable sensor suite which will be an enabler for space robotics missions in general;
e) Experimentation on deployment of very large structures (e.g. antenna reflectors and active telescope mirrors);
f) Validation of common building block in the most relevant environment with minimal duplication of means and activities.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The objective of the action is to reinforce the competitiveness of the European SMEs active in the design-based consumer goods area.
By encouraging the market uptake of new and creative solutions in the design-based consumer goods area, the action aims at multiplying the effects of foreseen solutions by mobilising a wide market uptake and reaching a critical mass and self-sufficiency during the project duration or in the short/medium term.
The measure therefore seeks to bridge the gap between research and innovation on the one hand and market on the other hand by supporting scale-up, market replication and/or first application of projects related to novel products, services, techniques or processes. By doing so, it will limit to a large extent the residual risk and will contribute to stimulating competitiveness among EU SMEs of the targeted value chains.
Design-based consumer goods SMEs are continuously reinventing their business models by changing production and distribution patterns to match the demand expressed by consumers and capture new market trends. In order to remain competitive, these companies have to continue moving towards higher added value products, processes and services. To take advantage of demographic changes and rapidly emerging new market trends, they need market-ready and consumer-oriented solutions.
Promising solutions may already exist but often they do not reach the market due to commercialisation obstacles and residual risks linked to scaling-up. They may also result from the fragmented structure of the activities involved, constituted typically by a large number of SMEs, with difficulties to attract the necessary skills and finance (“valley of death”).
In this context, the action aims to support projects related to market uptake of creative and novel products, services, techniques or processes, which feasibility has already been demonstrated but due to existing difficulties have not yet penetrated the market. It seeks to shorten the time-to-market of innovative solutions, remove obstacles to wider application of creative solutions, create or enlarge markets for related products (or services) and finally improve the competitiveness of European companies in world markets. Moreover, there is an important potential to replicate the innovations not only in participating SMEs but also across the supply-chain while generating important spill-overs.
The call will specifically target SMEs that can participate alone or lead a consortium (including for example academia, other research and technology organisations (RTOs) and relevant support services).
The methodology and performance indicators will follow best practice and mainly focus on business impact.

","Grant agreement
","25 July 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises only make a minimal use of the IP system. The vast majority of SMEs - 99% - do not own any patent, 91% do not own any registered trade mark, and only 0.7% own a registered design. Nine out of 10 SMEs do not own any of the above industrial property rights. Even fewer SMEs own EU-wide IP rights titles. This means that SMEs throughout the EU and throughout different sectors of economic activity are missing out on substantial growth and development opportunities. Although no cause-effect can be firmly established, SMEs that use IP generate 32% revenue more than their peers not using IP.
SMEs point out that they do not have the knowledge about and they do not see the benefits of intellectual property. An individual advice service that looks at all the products and services of the SME and its future business strategy to suggest a matching IP strategy is a response to this situation. Developed in some EU Member States, the IP pre-diagnostic or IP audit, is the exact tool that can help SMEs see the benefits of IP in their individual context and show them a how they can integrate IP in their business strategy.
SMEs also face relatively high costs of the IP system, which includes not only the application/registration fees but also the costs of external legal advice. The advice and the specific competence of a patent attorney in drafting patent applications is a necessary step to ensure the protection sought that will match the needs of the SME.
The creation of the unitary patens is designed to offer major opportunities for SMEs to ensure cheaper EU-wide protection of their intellectual property. This will allow for an easier buy-in of the unitary patent system by SMEs.
Scope:
The present action intends to facilitate access for SMEs to an effective protection and enforcement of their intellectual property by informing them about the benefits of using IP rights and about the opportunities linked with this new unitary patent, and by reimbursing some of the associated cost of using the new unitary patent.
In order to maximise impact, this action will focus on highly innovative SMEs, such as, the holders of the Horizon 2020 Seal of Excellence (SoE), which are considered as companies with a particularly high potential for exploiting their intellectual property rights. In some Member States where Seal of Excellence companies are not numerous enough another method of selection of innovative companies may be used.
Expected Impact:
The activities to be carried out by the beneficiary have to cover all the six areas listed below.
a) Setting up the Coordination Centre
b) Setting up the website
c) Publishing, coordinating and managing the calls for expression of interest
d) Action impact measurement
e) Management, quality control and evaluation
f) Reporting
The Coordination Centre will be responsible for preparing and publishing nine calls for applications for SMEs to express interest in being offered IP pre-diagnostic services or being reimbursed for the received support actions. These support actions (which are provided outside the framework of this call) include:
Free of charge advice to the SMEs on the potential of Intellectual Property to the development of their business, also referred to as ""IP pre-diagnostics services (support action Type 1, as laid down in Article 6 of the Rules for Implementation. Up to EUR 1 500 per support action and varying per country. The European Commission has set the amounts of financial support per country in the table provided as Annex to the Rules for Implementation.
Support to innovative SMEs by covering part the costs related to filing of patents covering more than two countries, before the European Patent Office (EPO). The cost co-financed by this type of support action concerns the pre-grant fees charged by the European Patent Office (support action type 2, as laid down in Article 7 of the Rules for Implementation) and covers 75% of the European patent fee (up to a maximum of EUR 2 500 per eligible SMEs).
Support to innovative SMEs by co-financing the costs of external legal advice by IP attorneys to carry out the preparation of patent applications and such filings (support action type 3, as laid down in Article 8 of the Rules for Implementation). The co-financing will cover 50% of external costs of legal advice related to the granting of a European patent (up to a maximum of EUR 2 000 per eligible SME).
The European Commission and EASME expect the action to finance:
at least 700 type 1 support actions, and
at least 500 type 2 support actions, and
at least 500 type 3 support actions."

","12 December 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
In order to facilitate strategic interregional collaborations and strong industry involvement, and to create a project pipeline for smart specialisation investments across Europe, the European Commission started to offer support to regional authorities, clusters and industry stakeholders through an integrated approach to smart specialisation, clusters and industrial modernisation. This approach combines two mutually reinforcing initiatives:
First, the Commission has set up Thematic Smart Specialisation Platforms to bring together regional authorities interested in joining forces in the implementation of their RIS3 strategies. This approach was launched in 2015 with the set-up of the Smart Specialisation Platform on Energy and two additional Thematic Platforms on Industrial Modernisation and on Agri-Food in 2016, with possibly others to follow.
Second, the Commission is starting with this call for proposals to mobilise European Strategic Cluster Partnerships for smart specialisation investments. These partnerships should be composed of cluster organisations, other business network organisations, technology centres and science parks aiming to boost inter-regional collaborations and innovation activities amongst groups of SMEs in specific thematic areas, related industries and value chains. Moreover, the strategic partnering of cluster organisations is not left to happen at random but with a specific linkage to the Thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on Industrial Modernisation.
Expected Impact:
The European Strategic Cluster Partnerships for smart specialisation investments shall contribute to:
developing and implementing a joint cluster partnership strategy with a common “European” vision for a given specific smart specialisation priority (including a joint branding and marketing), identifying collaboration and investment opportunities and drafting a roadmap of such joint activities;
implementing joint activities with a view to mobilise inter-regional collaboration and investments of industry actors, notably SMEs, and provide related business, technology and growth support services for the preparation and implementation of joint innovation and investments projects; and
improving the cluster-specific framework conditions in the partners’ regions by (a) identifying, preparing and testing new joint activities to strengthen cluster cooperation across the partnership; (b) gathering concrete feedback from SMEs on their specific barriers to innovation, skills, cooperation and investment (notably to feed into the discussions in the context of the Thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on Industrial Modernisation); and (c) undertaking activities to build linkages with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives and key networks aiming to address such barriers.
Most impact is expected from interregional collaboration if a dual approach is followed by involving both committed regional authorities (in charge of the implementation of smart specialisation strategies for research and innovation investments under the European Structural and Investment Funds) as well as the industry (mobilised via specialised SME intermediaries such as cluster organisations, business networks, technology centres and science parks). Therefore, this call aims to complement the mobilisation of interregional RIS3 partnerships of regional authorities under the Smart Specialisation Platform for Industrial Modernisation by generating corresponding partnerships of specialised SME intermediaries, and vice versa."

Deadline date","Scope:
The overall objective of this call is to strengthen cluster management excellence and facilitate exchanges and strategic partnering between clusters and specialised eco-systems across Europe, including through implementing a new “ClustersXchange” pilot scheme. As high quality cluster management and strategic connections between clusters are key elements of world-class clusters, the call aims to foster SME competitiveness and assist companies to successfully access global markets by exploiting the innovation and growth potential that clusters can offer.

The specific objective is to enhance the collaboration, networking and learning of cluster organisations and their members towards the profesionalisation of specialised and customised business support services provided or channelled to SMEs. This shall further contribute to strengthen ties between European ecosystems across regional and sectoral silos with the view to support a sustainable inter-regional partnering process and joint actions for strategic collaboration in various industrial specialisation areas linked to industrial modernisation and improving their business environment.

The aim is to foster cluster excellence capacity-building and to promote cross-cluster learning in order to help cluster organisations and their members to acquire the necessary skills and take actions to explore and take up new solutions. This shall address training and business needs along the value chain that require SMEs and cluster managers to adapt to trends, challenges and opportunities that come along with industrial change. This shall also include the development of strategic approaches and plans for a better cooperation at regional, national and EU level to address innovation, growth and globalisation challenges that SMEs face.

The call shall further enable groups of specialised enterprises, notably SMEs, together with other innovation actors in clusters, to find partners with complementary competences, to access value chains that cut across national, regional and sectoral boundaries as well as facilitate their access to technology centres and other scaling-up support organisations. This shall focus on engaging actors from regions with different levels of economic development – including from less developed and transition regions – and, likewise, cluster organisations with distinct stages of development and experience.
Expected Impact:
The European Strategic Cluster Partnerships shall specifically contribute to the following:
enhancing cluster managers' skills towards added-value SME support services;
supporting the development of a comprehensive cluster strategy for individual clusters, including for strengthened interregional collaboration and partnership development across EU value chains;
organising twinning, collaboration, networking and learning activities and cooperation projects and
supporting the implementation of a new “ClustersXchange” pilot scheme.
For this purpose, this call aims to bring together cluster organisations and other business network organisations from EU Member States or countries participating in the COSME programme interested in teaming up in European Strategic Cluster Partnerships."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The overall objective of this call for proposals is to strengthen cluster management excellence in the EU as a way to provide more professional business services to European SMEs through clusters, and in this way, contribute to the development of more world-class clusters in the European Union.
In order to pursue cluster management excellence, cluster organisations need to provide added-value support services to their members and develop strategic approaches to address the innovation, growth and globalization challenges that SMEs face. This requires to strengthen the support services provided to cluster companies; to gain further insights into cluster members’ positioning in value-chains, to take stock of emerging industrial trends and dynamics, to develop a shared vision of their members with regard to collaboration with other clusters in Europe and in global markets; to consistently liaise with public authorities regarding the business support environment and coherence with regional policy, and to shape-up strategic plans and roadmaps for sustained cluster development.
Specific objectives:
Enhance cluster managers' skills so as to generate added-value services for the cluster organisation's SME members and support their growth and competitiveness. The development of general management skills is not the purpose of this action. The focus is instead on equipping and enhancing skills that capture industry’s dynamics and allow cluster managers to provide better support services to SMEs, to create further added-value for their members and to better exploit opportunities in the Single Market and beyond.
Support cluster managers to develop a comprehensive strategy for the cluster they manage, with a view to support the growth and the competitiveness of its members, as well as a roadmap for its implementation. With regard to cluster strategy development, this includes the promotion of strategic collaboration between cluster managers and regional authorities in charge of cluster policies, and stakeholders, in the regional innovation ecosystems. This shall help to ensure coherence and compliance with regional priorities, especially in the context of smart specialisation strategies, and to capitalise on regional public and private research, innovation and infrastructure investment dynamics.
Facilitate collaboration among cluster organisations in consortia eager to operate at European level and committed to exploit synergies towards common activities and joint strategy development.
Promote cross-cluster learning, exchange of knowledge and expertise, both across cluster organisations in each consortium and between the various consortia that will be formed through this call.
Scope:
The eligible tasks and activities to support the specific objectives of this call are described in the following:
Task A: Enhancement of cluster managers' skills towards added-value SME support services
Task B: Development of a comprehensive strategy for the cluster
Task C: Facilitating cluster cooperation and synergies on skills enhancement and strategy development
Task D: Awareness raising and dissemination of project outcomes
More details can be found in the call text.
Expected Impact:
The programme will contribute to promote cluster excellence, also through enhanced inter-regional and inter-sectoral collaboration among clusters in COSME participating countries. The support to strategic collaboration of clusters on joint industrial projects will contribute to the reindustrialisation of the EU. Through this action, it is expected that a high number of SMEs in clusters and business networks will receive more professional business support services from their respective organisations."

The key objective of the action is to contribute to the development of a privacy and data protection culture in the unmanned aircraft (UA) sector in the European countries, taking into account the specificities of the different actors - manufacturers, pilots and operators. The action is focussing only on professional non-governmental activities performed in the EU member states and addresses mainly the needs of SMEs, start-ups and entrepreneurs active in the UA field.
Scope:
This action will build on and reinforce the privacy and data protection dimension of the DRONE-RULES.EU web-portal created under measure COS-WP2014-2.2-005. In order to avoid duplication with the previous action, applicants are invited to carefully review the DRONE-RULES.EU website and take due account of the material and information published.
The main aim is to develop e-learning modules and tools which will cover all relevant privacy issues and data protection principles (lawfulness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality, accountability), concepts (pseudonymisation, privacy by design and privacy by default of products and processes, code of conduct, data protection impact assessment) and requirements (consent, transparency, information, access) of the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR). They will take into account specificities of national privacy regulations that may exist in the EU member states.
The e-learning material produced will result in a coherent and comprehensive course. This course should provide a common minimum training mandatory for UA professionals as well as modular and progressive training adaptable to the specificities and needs of the trainees. In addition to the e-learning material, various instruments will be developed to provide a practical and tailored support to UA operators, pilots and manufacturers in their day-to-day activities: practical recommendations, guidelines, check lists, code of conduct, etc.
The online course and a tool box will be piloted and this will allow checking the adequacy of the approach. For this purpose at least 3 onsite training sessions with the presence of consortium's experts will be organised. These training sessions will take place in 3 different EU member states having substantial UA activities. In order to ensure a comprehensive test of the draft material produced, the training sessions must involve a full range of UA operators, pilots and manufacturers active in different UA fields. Each training session should gather at least 15 trainees.
Expected Impact:
After the completion of the online course UA professionals should be able to identify the privacy and data protection issues involved in their daily business and know how to address them. The course will provide also a self-assessment tool.
The action aims to provide the following key deliverables:
online course consisting of different e-learning modules providing a flexible tool adaptable to the specific needs of the trainees
set of business oriented tools supporting the daily work of UA stakeholders
minimum 3 onsite training sessions"

Objectives
This action will support projects involving a large diversity of players active in different cultural and creative sectors, to carry out a broad spectrum of activities and initiatives. The action is anchored in the policy framework of the Culture strand of the Creative Europe programme and its cross-cutting issues (inclusiveness, reduction of environmental impact and gender equality). European cooperation projects are also meant to contribute to the implementation of emerging EU policy initiatives such as the New European Bauhaus.
European cooperation projects are open to all the cultural and creative sectors. However, considering that this action aims at pursuing the objectives of the CULTURE strand of the programme, projects involving exclusively organisations from the audio-visual sector and projects of an exclusive audiovisual content are not targeted for funding under it.
Support will be given to cooperation projects contributing to the following objectives:
Objective 1 - Transnational creation and circulation: to strengthen the transnational creation and circulation of European works and artists;
Objective 2 – Innovation: to enhance the capacity of European cultural and creative sectors to nurture talents, to innovate, to prosper and to generate jobs and growth.
Concretely the targeted projects are the following:
Transnational creation and circulation: where trans-national co-operation is required for artistic and financing reasons. This is in line with the legal base and its priorities in order to increase the European dimension of the artistic and creative process. Co-production is also a tool to stimulate creativity, share resources and facilitate the trans-national distribution of content and the circulation of artists. Projects will have to take into account the new context such as health or environmental concerns and integrate innovative (digital) ways of producing and disseminating content.
Innovation: is necessary for the evolution of the sector and its competiveness. Innovation has to be understood in a broad way. Innovations are not necessarily of a technological nature and can include the development and experimentation of new practices or new models but also the transfer and dissemination of good practices from more advanced European regions or sectors to other regions in Europe or disciplines.
Applicants shall identify and select (in part C of the application form) which of the two above-mentioned objectives (Objective 1 or Objective 2) the proposed project aims to address (this selection shall be made even if some projects could be relevant for both objectives). The extent to which the objective chosen is addressed by the project will be assessed under the award criterion ‘’Relevance”. See Section 9 of this document.
Themes and priorities (scope)
In addition, projects shall address at least one (and no more than two) of the following priorities:
Audience: to increase cultural access to and participation in culture as well as audience engagement and development both physically and digitally;
Social inclusion: to promote societal resilience and to enhance social inclusion in/through culture in particular of/for people with disabilities, people belonging to minorities and people belonging to socially marginalised groups, as well as intercultural dialogue;
Sustainability: to contribute to the European Green Deal and including the New European Bauhaus, by encouraging the European cultural and creative sectors to co-create, adopt and disseminate more environment-friendly practices, as well as to raise awareness on sustainable development through their cultural activities;
New technology: to help the European cultural and creative sectors fully take advantage of new technologies to enhance their competitiveness, as well as to accelerate their digital transition as a response to the COVID-19 crisis;
International dimension: to build the capacity within the European cultural and creative sectors, including grass-roots organisations and micro-organisations, to be active at the international level – in Europe and beyond;
Projects from the sectors book and publishing, music, architecture and cultural heritage can either address one of the priorities spelled out above (priorities 1 to 5) or address the following sector specific priorities (10% of the budget of the call will be allocated to projects implementing sector-specific priority).
Projects from other sectors can only address the priorities indicated above (priorities 1 to 5).
Applicants will have to choose in part C of the application form which cultural sector(s) the project is primarily related to.
Sector specific priorities: For 2021, the following targeted annual priorities have been defined for the sectors music, publishing, cultural heritage and architecture, as identified by political dialogues and stakeholders’ consultations, to support capacity building activities, such as training, networking or market access activities, and support to become more resilience.
Projects shall meet the following specific sectorial priorities:
For the book (publishing) sector: Reinforce the capacity of book sector professionals in the sales of translation or adaptation rights with a view to increase the circulation of European literary works, and in particular works written in lesser-used languages, in Europe and beyond.
For the music sector: Building on the 2018-2020 Music Moves Europe preparatory action on music, and considering the specific circumstances of the pandemic and its impact, reinforce the capacity of music professionals in:

Objectives
This action will support projects involving a large diversity of players active in different cultural and creative sectors, to carry out a broad spectrum of activities and initiatives. The action is anchored in the policy framework of the Culture strand of the Creative Europe programme and its cross-cutting issues (inclusiveness, reduction of environmental impact and gender equality). European cooperation projects are also meant to contribute to the implementation of emerging EU policy initiatives such as the New European Bauhaus.
European cooperation projects are open to all the cultural and creative sectors. However, considering that this action aims at pursuing the objectives of the CULTURE strand of the programme, projects involving exclusively organisations from the audio-visual sector and projects of an exclusive audiovisual content are not targeted for funding under it.
Support will be given to cooperation projects contributing to the following objectives:
Objective 1 - Transnational creation and circulation: to strengthen the transnational creation and circulation of European works and artists;
Objective 2 – Innovation: to enhance the capacity of European cultural and creative sectors to nurture talents, to innovate, to prosper and to generate jobs and growth.
Concretely the targeted projects are the following:
Transnational creation and circulation: where trans-national co-operation is required for artistic and financing reasons. This is in line with the legal base and its priorities in order to increase the European dimension of the artistic and creative process. Co-production is also a tool to stimulate creativity, share resources and facilitate the trans-national distribution of content and the circulation of artists. Projects will have to take into account the new context such as health or environmental concerns and integrate innovative (digital) ways of producing and disseminating content.
Innovation: is necessary for the evolution of the sector and its competiveness. Innovation has to be understood in a broad way. Innovations are not necessarily of a technological nature and can include the development and experimentation of new practices or new models but also the transfer and dissemination of good practices from more advanced European regions or sectors to other regions in Europe or disciplines.
Applicants shall identify and select (in part C of the application form) which of the two above-mentioned objectives (Objective 1 or Objective 2) the proposed project aims to address (this selection shall be made even if some projects could be relevant for both objectives). The extent to which the objective chosen is addressed by the project will be assessed under the award criterion ‘’Relevance”. See Section 9 of this document.
Themes and priorities (scope)
In addition, projects shall address at least one (and no more than two) of the following priorities:
Audience: to increase cultural access to and participation in culture as well as audience engagement and development both physically and digitally;

Sustainability: to contribute to the European Green Deal and including the New European Bauhaus, by encouraging the European cultural and creative sectors to co-create, adopt and disseminate more environment-friendly practices, as well as to raise awareness on sustainable development through their cultural activities;
New technology: to help the European cultural and creative sectors fully take advantage of new technologies to enhance their competitiveness, as well as to accelerate their digital transition as a response to the COVID-19 crisis;
International dimension: to build the capacity within the European cultural and creative sectors, including grass-roots organisations and micro-organisations, to be active at the international level – in Europe and beyond;
Projects from the sectors book and publishing, music, architecture and cultural heritage can either address one of the priorities spelled out above (priorities 1 to 5) or address the following sector specific priorities (10% of the budget of the call will be allocated to projects implementing sector-specific priority).

","Recognition Prize
","01 July 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With their capacity to connect people, places, public and private actors, urban areas can substantially enhance innovation in Europe. This award will aim to provide European level recognition to those cities that make the most to promote innovation within their communities and thereby improve the quality of their citizens’ lives. It will address the challenge of fostering innovation through actions at city level, by acknowledging innovative solutions to build up an innovation ecosystem and ideas to further expand and scale up these initiatives, thereby leveraging and inducing further systemic innovation in cities.
Scope:
For the purpose of this award, a ""city"" is understood to be an urban area, excluding metropolitan areas, larger urban zones and conurbations, and is understood as an administrative unit governed by a city council or another form of democratically elected body. It will be considered as a whole system, including built environment, municipal authorities and citizens, organizations and public structures, as a platform capable of facilitating the growth and development of creativity and innovation in its different meanings.
Expected Impact:
The award will illustrate at the European level the commitment to innovation at the city level and to inspire and share best practice with other cities in Europe and act as innovation ambassadors further afield. At the city level, the first impact will be the recognition of successful innovation policies within a city which raises the profile of the team and the political leaders that have developed and implemented these policies. Secondly, the award will help the city open up connections with other cities that would wish to learn from the city and analyse which policies and activities could be transferable. This will allow the city to attract international interest in its activities. Thirdly, the prize should encourage and contribute to enabling the city to develop new innovation activities made possible only by the access of funding from the prize and by attracting investors, industry, top class researchers as well as talented and entrepreneurial individuals and so strengthening the innovative potential of the city in general."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:
Aviation Security is governed by EU legislation (such as Directive 2008/114/EC of 8 December 2008 on the identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and the assessment of the need to improve their protection) and implemented at airports (checkpoint for passengers and staff, hold baggage and air cargo control areas, etc.) and to relevant supply chains. The security requirement is to prevent unlawful interference with aviation security through aircraft, from which stems the requirement to prohibit dangerous items such as arms and explosives ('the prohibited items') coming on board an aircraft, be they carried on people, in their items, or concealed as air cargo or mail as well as supplies. Maintaining the integrity of security restricted areas for persons, items, consignments and supplies, from the moment they were controlled until they enter a secured aircraft is vital.
Policy is moving towards more risk-based, outcome-focused, passenger-facilitation oriented measures.
The challenge for aviation security research shall be to explore new ways and ideas that are conceptually very different to those already in development or deployed. This shall lead to designing systems and processes that are faster, more accurate and reliable, less invasive, and overall more efficient to operate than existing ones.
Examples of elements to visions for the future of aviation security are outlined in the COPRA FP7 project[1], Flightpath 2050[2] and IATA check point of the future[3].
Research under this topic needs to go beyond advising on current operations which are improved through short and medium term (below a 5-7 years’ time horizon) action. The development of the detection technology needs to be threat-based and take stock of the latest terrorist development in particular the threat materials and concealment methods of e.g. home-made explosives, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.
 Scope:
The proposal should therefore investigate systems which will translate the mentioned objectives into operationally viable processes which have an identifiable exploitation path for operators to use. It should also explore novel opportunities for security interventions and how current processes could be re-designed to give an equivalent security outcome but better passenger experience or simplification of industry processes. It could investigate how to merge other security activities or (passenger) controls with aviation security. It may test opportunities to integrate different processes into a better overall system, including at local, national, European and global level.
While proposal should aim to deliver solutions for higher levels of security and facilitation it should be developed and tested to assess their impact and viability. Realistic estimations and cost-benefit analyses of proposed solutions, both from a governmental as well as from an industry point of view, should be included to help identify promising and reasonable approaches. The legal implications of any proposal should also be assessed, especially for health and safety, but also under data protection and non-discrimination principles.
Possible areas of research (not exclusive) could be: alternative screening processes and interventions; investigate how, where and when aviation security controls shall take place to provide the most effective and efficient results; look at the further development of processes' to maximise security outcome and minimise impact on industry and passengers; and how compliance and their effectiveness will be demonstrated. It should include system level solutions.
It could touch on technical areas such as: integrated technologies and processes; the use of artificial intelligence; technologies and methods to screen items/people at a distance; radically new sensor technologies; networked information sharing; passenger tracking; automation; data/sensor fusion; self-verification systems for compliance monitoring; procedures should noxious gases accidently (or otherwise) be released on-board a plane; and integrated alarm resolution.
The effective implementation of any approaches should be explored through well recorded testing and trials. Trials should identify if any of the benefits are possible; if the process may introduce any vulnerabilities; and how compliance with such approaches could be assessed. Findings from relevant on-going Seventh Framework Programme projects should be taken into account.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately(similar to the Seventh Framework Programme Capability Projects described in the general introduction). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[4] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, and US homeland security research entities. Funding for third countries is however still subject to the  evaluations.
Expected impact:  
Higher level of threat and risk-based security and a reduced operational impact on passengers and industry. Faster, more accurate and reliable, less invasive, and overall more efficient to operate systems and processes than existing ones throughout their lifetime.

Specific challenge:
The aim is to engage small and medium enterprises in security research and development and in particular to facilitate and accelerate the transition of their developed products/services to the market place.
The specific challenge of the actions and activities envisaged under this topic are related to protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures .
Specific consideration should be given to 'urban soft targets', which are exposed to increasing security threats which can be defined as urban areas into which large numbers of citizens are freely admitted, for usual activities or special events or routinely reside or gather. Among others, these include parks, squares and markets, shopping malls, train and bus stations, passenger terminals, hotels and tourist resorts, cultural, historical, religious and educational centres and banks.
The critical infrastructures sectors listed in the European Programme for Critical Infrastructures Protection (EPCIP)[1], including, among others, energy installations and networks, communications and information technology, finance (banking, securities and investment), water (dams, storage, treatment and networks), supply chain and government (e.g. critical services, facilities, information networks, assets and key national sites and monuments) are not only relevant at a national scale but they can be considered critical infrastructures in an urban context as well.
The objective is to carry out a small-scale demonstration of innovative technologies and tools.
Taking into consideration the results of past and on-going EU and international research in this field, they can cover any aspect of the urban critical infrastructure protection, such as, for example: designing buildings and urban areas; protection of energy/transport/communication grids; critical infrastructure surveillance solutions; protecting supply chains; avoiding cyber-attacks and developing cyber resilience systems for critical infrastructures.
The scope of this topic is focused to cover, for example:
- high throughput screening of people and their bags including the ability to screen them in reasonably real-time as people approach entrances to buildings or enter public transportation system;
- high throughput screening for vehicles to identify threats that warrant further inspection (as opposed to random searching);
- potential CBRN-E threats and the way in which these threats could be carried-out against soft targets and critical infrastructures;
- mitigation of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (IED), with a specific focus on vehicle-borne ones (e.g. in cases of parked vehicles, penetrative attacks, etc.).
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of users, such as national law enforcement agencies public and and private operators of critical infrastructures and networks.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The proposals could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of protecting urban soft targets and critical infrastructures and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase & or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation (‘freedom to operate’).
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, if any, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge protecting urban soft targets in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

Specific challenge:
The expected increase of frequency and severity of climate-related natural catastrophes and the current risks of disasters of geological origin pose a serious threat to buildings and physical assets located in vulnerable locations, including critical infrastructures (i.e. public buildings, such as governmental offices, transport stations, terminals and historical buildings and monuments) along their life cycle. One of the responses to be better prepared to crises related to hazards is to adapt building standards and infrastructure in order to limit the risks of demolition, protect critical infrastructure and save human lives in the case of a major event. As a complement to current research in this area, and based on the knowledge of risks (natural or man-originated) in vulnerable areas in Europe, building standards should be developed and tested, applying a number of technological means and design procedures.
Scope:
A comprehensive approach should be developed that take into account the security issue from the conceptual design of any building to its operation (in the case of a critical infrastructure) or use (in the case of households). Cascade failure of interconnected infrastructure assets (installations for energy, transport, water, ICT) due to co-location or hub-functions needs to be avoided. The comparison of different solutions tested should include cost and cost/benefit analyses, and societal implications.
The proposal shall develop an EU methodological guide with recommendations and software tools for adapting building and infrastructure standards and design methodologies taking into account vulnerability induced man-made or natural impacts. The project content shall be explicitly placed in the greater context of urban development strategies focusing on safety and resilience. Furthermore the research proposal shall demonstrate its finding using appropriate case studies and demonstration facilities, including comparative cost and cost/benefit analyses.
The topic will complement Seventh Framework Programme research focusing on impacts of extreme weather on critical infrastructure.

Specific Challenge:
Critical Infrastructure functions are technologically and operationally interconnected, of which their exact possibilities and potential risks need to be better understood. For example: in the case of energy distribution networks, especially “smart grids”,  the massive proliferation of ""Smart Meters"" as mandated by the Third energy Package introduces new threats. The same is applicable to all utility supply networks (e.g. water or gas system supply). The systems and meters of the charge points for electrical cars should be also a concern, specially considering the increasing market for this type of vehicles
Scope:
The objective is to analyse potential new threats generated by the massive introduction of “smart meters” on the distribution grid system and propose concrete solutions in order to mitigate the risks, guarantee the electromagnetic compatibility, improve resilience and reduce vulnerability of critical infrastructure “smart grid”, due for example to cyber-attacks, or to the locally diffused interconnectivity with renewable utility grids, and the existence of widely spread entry points that could locally influence the utility grid and its functioning.etc.
The new technologies, processes, methods and dedicated capabilities shall be developed, which shall also take into account the urban areas implications (i.e. the general public subscribing to this service). The proposal shall provide concrete solutions for securing public and private critical networked infrastructures and services against the above mentioned threats.
A key characteristic of the Smart Grid is that it consists of millions of devices, spread across organizations and households in a vast geographical area. In case of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) usage, a utility company would face an extreme credential management overhead and logistic costs of maintenance. This means that new security management schemes must be designed and evaluated for the Smart Grid to meet its high scalability requirements.
Security solutions must take into account that an adversary has a physical access to smart meters. These devices’ cost, power, memory, and computational limitations restrict the ability to deploy standard trusted platform modules on them. Due to the fact that smart meters will be deployed for many years, novel cryptographic solutions should be tested that include message encryption, authentication and integrity, along with the highest possible levels of efficiency in time-critical and high volume data
It is expected that consortia under this research topic will select the most representative sample of “smart meters” used in Europe’s smart grid as starting point of the research and analyse their potential weakness/threats.
Moreover the proposal shall study and provide solutions in order mitigate the impact of “smart meters” on the current critical infrastructure security and resilience to new threats.
It should take into consideration the work completed to date by the the Smart Grid Task Force Working Group 2, concerning the cyber security assessment framework and the related Best Available Techniques there defined.
Finally the research should be carried out in the context of policy initiatives at EU level on the Smart Meters and Smart Grids, such as the 2011 CEN/CENELEC/ETSI Mandate 490 on smart grids (including the security and data privacy issues on the roll-out of smart metering systems), and the 2009 CEN/CENELEC/ETSI Mandate 441 on smart meters, as well as the guidance on software in smart meters, provided by WELMEC.
Proposals addressing this topic may involve the use of classified background information (EU or national) or the production of security sensitive results. As such, certain project deliverables may require security classification. The final decision on the classification of projects is subject to the security evaluation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €2m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately appropriately (similar to the FP7 Capability Projects described in the general introduction). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
- higher protection levels of utility distribution grid infrastructures;
- more effective and systematic approach to resilience enhancements of smart grid critical infrastructures when new components are added;
- improved applicability through small scale proof of concept of system to demonstrate the “resilience” of the proposed “system”;
- increased understanding of technology providers on modern operational requirements thus increasing their competitiveness.
Type of action: Research & Innovation Actions
The action is expected to proactively target the needs and requirements of public bodies and industry.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4; please see part G of the General Annexes.

The handling of soft materials with the involvement of robots remains limited. The control systems of the robot need to be very sensitive, accurate and fast to prevent unwanted irreversible deformations and damages. Further research is needed in order to develop handling devices which are not pre-programmed for one specific task, but are intelligent and universally dexterous.
Future robots will have to be able to handle soft products while controlling their level of deformation, e.g. in situations where the objects are being manipulated with multiple contact points. Low-cost robots are essential. New handling technologies for flexible materials will lead to disruptive innovations in textile, paper and food processing, and will support a widespread implementation, in particular by SMEs.
Scope:
In order to automate production processes involving soft and flexible materials, Proposals need to cover both of the following areas:
Innovative technologies for the handling of the soft and flexible materials such as gripping, moving, positioning, sorting, joining etc. so that it can be included in larger automated production processes. Low-cost and universal dexterity are key concepts;
System solutions that can manage all product and material related data (size, shape, weight, colour, material composition, defects, etc.), so that their automated handling can be embedded in larger production and process management systems.

a) Support pilot activities and knowledge transfer across different sectors: Coordination of the selected platform and pilot projects under the topics of this Focus Area, and where applicable with similar initiatives in Member States and Associated Countries, and with standardisation initiatives and support in ecosystem building to increase the impact of the overall set of projects. Exploitation of synergies between technology-based platform and pilot activities such as IoT and data value chains and the sector-specific platform and piloting projects of the Focus Area related to issues such as architecture, interoperability and standards approaches. Exchange on requirements for the development of common methodologies for design, testing and validation and for success and impact measurement. Furthermore, proposals need to promote the results obtained, support the enlargement of the ecosystems around the projects, facilitate the access for entrepreneurs/API developers/Makers and SMEs in general, and support the transfer of skills and know-how to industry.
b) Legal, regulatory and security support: Further development and exploitation of security and privacy mechanisms towards best practices for digital platforms and pilots including contribution to pre-normative activities and to standardization; regulatory and legal support in relation to data ownership and protection, security, liability, across sector legislations. The corresponding activities will be developed and addressed in the pilots and consolidated at programme level under this horizontal support activity line.
c) Preparation of a digital industrial platform for the construction sector: proposals should bring together relevant stakeholders and define a reference architecture for a digital industrial platform for the construction sector that increases productivity and optimises material usage in the construction sector, including for SMEs. It needs to take into account the recently developed framework with core indicators to assess the environmental performance of buildings, including circular economy aspects[1]. Proposals should take stock of other ongoing initiatives, promote mutual learning and coordination, and identify knowledge and intervention gaps. Widespread use of Building Information Modelling and building passports will promote information sharing about different resources and their life cycles, re-use of materials, productive processes, including improved engineering, procurement and supply chain management and are therefore part of the scope.
Proposals should address only one of the above-mentioned subtopics a), b), or c). The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 2 million for a) and EUR 1 million for each of b) and c) would allow above areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one coordination and support action is supported for each of the areas above.
Expected Impact:
Tangible contributions from European key players to actively engage with the platform building process;
Efficient information sharing across the programme stakeholders for horizontal issues of common interests;
Maintaining and extending an active eco-system of relevant stakeholders, including start-ups and SMEs;
Validation in usage context of usability, risk and security assessment and identification of gaps related to trust, security and privacy, respect for the scarcity and vulnerability of human attention, and liability and sustainability;
Strengthening of the role of EU on the global scale, in particular in terms of standardisation activities and access to foreign markets;
Increased prospects on productivity improvements in the construction sector, and on a contribution to a more sustainable construction sector.

","03 July 2019
","14 May 2020","Specific Challenge:
Nano-enabled bio-based materials can contribute to a stronger circular economy and more sustainable growth, with due consideration to life-cycle impact as well as their potential to substitute scarce materials. Novel approaches should be deployed for industry to produce new, eco-friendly, nano-enabled bio-based materials with advanced properties and functionalities relevant for various applications.
The challenge is to upscale and demonstrate in an industrial environment the sustainable conversion of different types of feedstock and bio resources in value-added novel, advanced, nano-enhanced bio-based materials and their application in products.
Scope:
Establish Open Innovation Test Beds (OITB) by upgrading existing or developing new materials facilities and pilot lines, and make available to industry and interested parties, including SMEs, their services for the design, development, testing, regulatory (including safety) and environmental assessment, and upscaling of specific material compositions;
The focus is on new nano-enabled bio-based materials' functions, features, capabilities, robustness and properties, processing techniques and optimisation of process parameters, from the transformation of bio-based building blocks and to the production of new, eco-friendly, nano-enabled bio-based materials relevant to various applications, covering the full scale of new or existing industrial and consumer products;
Proposals should assess regulatory, safety, economic and technical barriers and should develop and validate tools to enable in-line quality control processes;
Open access at fair conditions and cost as well as outreach and dissemination across Europe, based on a distinct methodology;
Materials should be demonstrated in relevant industrial environments;
Proposals submitted under this topic are encouraged to include actions designed to facilitate cooperation, across Europe, with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Proposals should therefore include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the LEIT Introduction in this Work Programme. In particular, they should demonstrate the likelihood of an additional turnover of at least 4 times the requested EU funding, within 5 years of the end of the grant.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 7 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The Open Innovation Test Bed should help industrialise a new generation of nano-enabled bio-based materials. Proposals must address all the following impact criteria:
Realisation of open and upgraded facilities at the EU level for the design, development, testing, safety assessment, and upscaling of nano-enabled bio-based materials, easily accessible to users across different regions of Europe;
At least a 20% increase in the number of new SME users for existing test beds;
At least 15% improved industrial process parameters and 20% faster verification of materials performance for highly promising applications;
At least 20% improvement in industrial productivity, reliability, environmental performance, durability, and reduction of life-cycle costs of these materials;
Facilitating access to finance (for SMEs in particular) for investing in these materials or in applications using them;
Identification of regulatory requirements and regulatory barriers to market introduction.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

","Research and Innovation action
","16 October 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus, the Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme produces a wealth of data and information regarding the Earth sub-systems (land, atmosphere, oceans) and cross-cutting processes (climate change, emergency and security). Cooperation with international partners is key to promoting the uptake of Copernicus globally, exploiting possibilities for integrating in-situ, space data and information technologies. Building the Copernicus full, free and open data policy, the Commission seeks to facilitate access to Copernicus data and information for interested international partners. Administrative cooperation arrangements on Copernicus data access and earth observation data exchange have already been signed with the United States and Australia, and discussions towards similar cooperation have been started with other countries and regions (including Africa, Latin American countries and Asia-Pacific countries).
Cooperation with partner countries should be fostered with a view to using Copernicus data to jointly develop algorithms, services and/or products which serve local user needs and/or enhance the Copernicus global product quality.
Proposals are encouraged to use the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS), or other existing data access solutions instead of setting up their own download and processing infrastructure. They are also encouraged to integrate third-party data (including in-situ data) and envisage data assimilation into models and products made available on the Copernicus platform of the Copernicus services..
For such applications and developments to succeed in the market or with public users, the products need to be shaped according to users’ needs and their value to users must be openly demonstrated to the wider user community. This needs to be achieved in an environment integrated at the level of the user, in order for users to accept the innovative potential which the product promises. This will require also specific attention to be given to the various processes in place in the users’ workflows which incorporate the EO information. Furthermore, the transition of R&D product prototypes to viable commercial product lines after the end of the EU funded phase remains a challenge to be addressed early on during product development.
Scope:
Proposals shall address a wide variety of applications stemming from the use of Earth observation and their smart integration with other related technologies. Copernicus should be considered as part of the solution which may include other space or non-space inputs. This is likely to lead to greater value, opportunities and especially market uptake. Applications shall be sustained by a production process capable of delivering to the user a product which is validated and accepted as a marketable product in the international partner country. International collaboration has a key role to play in this context, as it enhances access to markets beyond the national borders, notably by enabling space application providers to absorb market-related tacit knowledge and know-how of their partners. Corresponding validations and customisations are to be undertaken, and the business case for the application is to be demonstrated. Service level models are to be developed, with appropriate quality of service definitions for the application. Application products are expected to adopt open standards for data documentation, data models and services including data processing, visualisation and cataloguing on a large scale.
Tasks shall include joint calibration and validation activities or integration of local in-situ systems to enhance the quality of data and service products. It is important to exploit the added value of integration of EO observation technologies (both satellite, airborne and ground based) with positioning ones, and ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by cloud computing) from international partner countries through the development of applications, and encourage their insertion into the market.
The choice of EO application is left to the proposer.
Applicants are advised to consult further information on the availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data, as well as issues recommended to be detailed in the proposals via the Commission’s Copernicus website[1].
For proposals under this topic:
Participation of at least one partner from a country that has signed a Copernicus Cooperation Arrangement[2] is required;
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable;
Participation of partners involved in international GEO initiatives is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Digitising and transforming European industry and services"".
Expected Impact:
Establish sustainable supply chains for innovative EO value added products and services with demonstrated commercial value with international client communities;
Complete integration, based on international standards, into the customer’s existing business processes and processing chains, as well as the economic viability of the application is to be demonstrated;
Enhance the European industry’s potential to take advantage of market opportunities and establish leadership in the field and to boost business activity;
Lead to new or improved products, processes or services on the market that are capable of generating within 3 years after the end of public funding a significant turnover for the participants, and create new jobs;
Lead to an improved quality of the Copernicus global product, thereby enhancing the stating of Copernicus data and information in a global environment and GEOSS.

Shortage in raw materials, increased energy prices and environmental constraints require the European process industry to improve its performance and flexibility and there are unexploited opportunities for digitising a large range of enterprises of very different size in the process industry.
Digitisation endows the production system with capabilities for analysis. This should enable the autonomous operation of the system based on embedded cognitive reasoning, while relying on high-level supervisory control. As a consequence, changes in the production process need to be detected and the system needs to be able to respond to these dynamic fluctuations, by adapting the production to stay within the target ranges of production costs and rate, as well as those of and sustainability parameters. A fully up-to-date interactive and self-learning process control integrated with management tools is essential to obtain an optimal efficiency, while maintaining adequate flexibility of the system in regard to changing feedstock, energy sources and product demand.
Scope:
Proposals need to develop new technologies to realise cognitive production plants, with improved efficiency and sustainability, by use of smart and networked sensor technologies, intelligent handling and online evaluation of various forms of data streams as well as new methods for self-organizing processes and process chains. Furthermore, proposals should cover the full digital transformation of a complete plant or site(s) including e.g. data acquisition, communication, automation, analytics, modelling, prediction and standardisation of relevant data interfaces. The following elements should be considered:
Improvement of online monitoring and innovative control technologies in terms of process performance and flexibility, maintenance needs and product quality;
Digital retrofitting of existing assets, integration towards and holistic optimisation of operations, data-analytics, real-time capability, use role-specific representation of information, feedback control & detect deviations and adjust operations immediately decision support (e.g. advanced process control, reactive scheduling);
Several among the following concepts: apply low-cost sensors for on-line assessment of product quality and integration into process control; robust optimisation methods to distributed targeted process monitoring; simulation methods for the analysis, characterisation and study of systems for enhanced operations and decision-making combination of various forms of data with cognitive insight to optimise and enhance resources;
Replicability and scalability of the concepts should be considered appropriately.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.

","Coordination and support action
","05 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to increase the number of initiatives for start-ups, scale-ups and entrepreneurs in the space downstream and upstream sectors (such as Incubators, Accelerators, Hackathons or AppCamps), provide solutions to accelerate the growth of space scale-ups and the commercialisation of their products, engage small and medium enterprises in space innovation, especially those not traditionally involved in it, and reduce as much as possible the technical and financial entry barriers to SMEs for Horizon 2020 to develop or adopt space-enabled solutions.
Scope:
To organise effective and sustainable initiatives at European level for:
supporting start-ups, scale-ups and entrepreneurs in the areas of applications, notably with regard to EGNOS/Galileo and Copernicus;
spinning-in/-out and solutions in support of the commercialisation of space.
Actions should be complementary to other actions developed at EU level (such as the European Innovation Council pilot, Copernicus and Galileo Masters, Copernicus Accelerator, Copernicus and Galileo Incubation initiatives, European Institute of Technology (EIT) Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs)) and should aim to build bridges between local and European initiatives.
Actions implemented under this topic should also support start-ups, scale-ups and entrepreneurs in accessing finance, as well as blended funding to enhance financial sustainability and viability of businesses within the space sector.
Actions should, moreover, support the work of the Copernicus Academy.
They should also integrate training/raise awareness on the data, information, resources and tools available within the DIAS and embrace best practices from these environments, as an enabling element in support of the development and scaling-up of start-ups.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Generation of new initiatives at local level (such as Incubators, Accelerators, Hackathons, Appcamps) complementing those at EU level;
Creation of new start-ups and applications notably through awareness raising activities and initiatives to facilitate technology transfer;
Generation of new services oriented solutions allowing innovative financial support frames;
Growth of scale-ups in Europe;
Increased access to finance and funding opportunities;
Enhanced financial sustainability of start-ups and scale-ups;
Increased survival rates of start-ups;
Increased commercialisation of scalable and cost-efficient solutions."

An ECSEL Innovation Action (IA) primarily consists of activities aiming at pilot lines, test beds, demonstrators, innovation pilots and zones of full-scale testing. These activities produce plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes, methods and tools or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale product validation and market replication.
A ‘technology or method introduction’ aims at the development, testing, and implementation of new technologies, tools or methods, which are a critical element of innovative products, which will be created in subsequent projects.
A 'demonstration or pilot' aims to validate the technical and economic viability of a new or improved technology, product, process, service or solution in an operational (or nearly operational) environment, whether industrial or otherwise, involving, where appropriate, a larger scale prototype or demonstrator.
A 'market replication' aims to support the first application/deployment in the market of an innovation that has already been demonstrated but not yet applied/deployed in the market due to market failures/barriers to uptake. 'Market replication' does not cover multiple applications in the market of an innovation that has already been applied successfully once in the market. 'First' means new at least to Europe or new at least to the application sector in question. Often such projects involve a validation of technical and economic performance at system level in real life operating conditions provided by the market.
The activities have their centre of gravity at the TRL 5-8.
An IA proposal in ECSEL JU is characterized by:

Execution by an industrial consortium including universities, institutes, SMEs and large companies:
Using innovative technology;
Developing and demonstrating innovative solutions in relation with the ECSEL Strategic Thrusts as outlined in the ECSEL MASP;

Establishment of a new and realistic innovation environment connected with an industrial environment, such as:
a pilot line facility capable of manufacturing
a zone of full-scale testing;
a development of new processes or tools and their introduction in several domains;
the development of frameworks or platforms together with the usage of these frameworks or platforms in innovative products.

Having a deployment plan leading to economic value creation in Europe.
In order to maximize effective implementation of the ECSEL top-level objectives, the list of IA proposals to be retained for public funding should constitute a balanced portfolio of projects applying innovative technologies (as defined in the MASP in the essential technology section) and applying them in different domains as defined in the MASP. The domains represent the demand side of technologies, and the development of new technologies represents the supply side of technologies.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolving network architecture that focuses on the separation of control and data planes. SDN addresses the fact that the static architecture of conventional networks is not well-suited to today’s high-bandwidth and very dynamic networking applications. SDN allows: (a) network behaviour to be controlled by software (programmability); (b) the creation of logically centralised network topologies which enable the intelligent control and management of resources; (c) the abstraction of services and applications from the underlying technologies; and (d) vendor-neutral networking infrastructure and openness.
SDN-enabled network architectures require reliable and high data rate communication between the network devices (SDN switches) and the SDN controller. Tactical networks on the other hand, may offer low rate and unreliable wireless links between highly mobile nodes. It is thus clear that, although SDN can offer significant benefits to tactical communications, a tactical network relying on SDN technologies will need to be very different from a typical civilian deployment as we know it today.
The main difficulties that a tactical SDN will need to overcome are:
Highly mobile and heterogeneous end-nodes with no access to fixed network infrastructure;
Unreliable and low data rate wireless links;
Limited resources (power, bandwidth, data-storage, size and weight);
Mission driven and frequent reconfiguration requirements;
Strict physical and cyber security requirements (SDN controller may be a single point of failure) in a highly aggressive and insecure environment;
Demanding logistics including backwards compatibility with legacy systems.
Scope:
Proposals shall address the feasibility and design of SDN-enabled networks suitable for tactical use. All of the following areas should be covered:
Network technologies, topologies and protocols suitable for tactical SDN-enabled networks;
Requirements that should be applied to the corresponding tactical SDN controller;
Use of Software Defined Radio (SDR) wireless nodes integrated in SDN-enabled tactical networks;
Power, bandwidth and storage requirements and trade-offs of tactical SDN switches and controllers;
Cyber security requirements, threats and counter-measures for tactical SDN-enabled networks;
Demonstration of a SDN testbed that will allow the evaluation of SDN concepts in representative tactical scenarios from a technical and operational point of view. The testbed is expected to:
Rely on non-proprietary wireless technologies in order to facilitate ample testing, experimentation and evaluation from various actors;
Incorporate a limited number of heterogeneous mobile nodes;
Rely on existing SDN technologies and protocols that will be suitably integrated and/or modified and/or enhanced to facilitate the required validation setup.
Targeted activities:
This proposal shall cover feasibility study and design, including the following activities:
Collection and analysis of the end-users (armed forces) requirements at the tactical and tactical edge level with regard to existing networking SDN solutions;
Definition of performance indicators to evaluate technical solutions versus the end-users requirements;
Study of SDR and SDN interoperability requirements, constrains and consequences;
Development of a tactical SDN testbed that will allow proof-of-concept;
Definition and execution of extensive laboratory tests and cyber attacks under representative tactical scenarios;
Collection and analysis of data for performance evaluation and insights provisioning;
Suggestion of roadmaps for further development of tactical SDN R&T (Research and Technology) efforts.
Main high-level requirements:
The following general requirements shall be fulfilled by the SDN testbed:
The testbed shall allow the experimentation with various technologies, network topologies and protocols suitable for tactical operations;
The testbed shall allow the definition of representative tactical scenarios through the configuration of highly dynamic experimentation conditions;
The testbed shall allow the evaluation of the communication performance, robustness and resilience in at least three cases: controller to controller, controller to switch, switch to switch;
The testbed shall be able to demonstrate resource reallocation and policy enforcement on demand and produce the respective performance indicators;
Cybersecurity enabling protocols and components shall be identified and tested including the elimination of single point of failures;
SDN switches and controllers shall comply with realistic tactical Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) requirements.
Expected Impact:
Identify the necessary modifications to the existing SDN systems in order to make them suitable for tactical networks and operations;
Assess the advantages and disadvantages of applying SDN technologies to tactical communication networks based on objective Key Performance Indicators (KPIs);
Support the development, competitiveness, efficiency and strategic autonomy of the European industry in the field of SDN products and technologies;
Enhance the interoperability of tactical communication systems of coalition forces;
Create secure ad-hoc and distributed networks avoiding the existence of single points of failure."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The main benefits of adopting network architectures based on the Software Defined Network (SDN) paradigm in defence networks at strategical, infrastructural and technology levels are known:
agility and flexibility;
‘independency’ on the network elements’ technology;
capability to efficiently use network resources;
broader situation awareness;
faster responses to events;
etc.
Through the decoupling of network control and forwarding functions, SDN lets network control become programmable, and the underlying infrastructure be abstracted from applications and network services. SDN makes networks more flexible and easier to manage, simplifying and automating labour-intensive network management functions, service development and deployment, easier to re-configure and to interoperate among diverse networks.
Nevertheless, challenges for SDN remain when considering tactical networking, especially when carrying out ad hoc communications and information sharing. Tactical edge/deployable networking is probably the most challenging area where SDN can be used, but at the same time the one that can benefit the most from this new technology.
For strategical and infrastructural domains, SDN network architectures are typically centralized architectures that rely on a single SDN controller communicating with the SDN switches and the applications. Such architectural approach does not have to be automatically replicated for tactical networks which specific characteristics can be quite demanding: bandwidth constraints, links’ instability , frequent network topology changes, limited devices’ capabilities (battery and storage capacity, CPU (Central processing unit) power), high dynamicity (frequent mission reconfigurations and high mobility of nodes), stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, presence of legacy networking elements , the need for redundancy and resilience for communications and information sharing and against cyber-attacks.
These characteristics, together with the increasing need for day zero interoperability within coalition federated scenario, require that SDN technologies and solutions for tactical applications are selected on a case-by-case basis.
One of the challenges is to identify the proper SDN technologies and solutions that allow to select the SDN network architecture which is the most suitable for the tactical edge/deployable network that has to be established on the basis of:
the operational requirements of the mission;
the available resources (e.g.: mobile elements on the field, available transmission means, heterogeneity of the network elements);
the environmental/electromagnetic conditions and cyber threats of the operational scenario.
This challenge includes the capability to have SDN enabled products that allow to carry out the proper SDN architecture, with a high level of centralization or a distributed architecture such as a full SDN or hybrid (mix of pure SDN technology and legacy technology) network architecture, wherever and whenever it is needed.
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of SDN solutions (including the development of technologies and products), for a network architectural framework which provides EU armed forces with the needed information to select the most proper network architecture. This network architecture must be suitable for the operational scenario and mission requirements referring to specific operational use cases, based on CONOPS coming from the end users (armed forces).
This capability is to be shown in tactical edge/deployable applications by looking at the benefits for voice communications and C2 services and highlighting, where applicable, how the interactions with intelligent software defined radio device (e.g. cognitive radio), SDN enabled, can further improve the effectiveness of the mission.
The SDN architecture must be as much as possible suitable to support the new emerging defence technology against cyber-attacks in order to be effective not only for the network situational awareness, but also for the cyber situational awareness.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study, design, prototyping and testing of the proposed SDN solution, not excluding downstream activities.
The targeted activities must in particular include:
the definition of the set of reference operational use cases on the basis of the CONOPS and requirements of the end users that have to be envisaged in the network architecture framework;
a feasibility implementation study of the applicability of the selected SDN technologies to existing/future products, in a coalition SDN federated scenario. This study must be undertaken as guideline to be taken into consideration for the definition of the interoperability standards in tactical coalition networks (e.g. to be taken into consideration within the Federated Mission Networking initiative);
the development of the network architecture framework which allows to identify the most suitable SDN network architecture for the reference operational use cases;
the development of SDN controllers and switches functions that can be hosted on the same devices so as to make the same equipment suitable to be used in a centralized or distributed SDN network according to the operational needs, or to be used as backup SDN node in case of redundant architecture;
the identification of the Software Defined Radio (SDR) device and suitable waveforms characteristics enabling for SDN usage;
the development of the proper northbound and southbound API (Application programming interface) to allow to see the benefits for voice and C2 services;
the development of the functions to be used for communications among different SDN controllers in distributed architecture and exploring applications in federated scenarios;
field experiments and system validation.
Main high-level requirements
The proposed SDN solutions should allow:
a centralized SDN network architecture;
a distributed SDN architecture with a hierarchical/redundant structure;
the consideration of hybrid SDN/legacy architecture, highlighting the benefits for mission critical applications in emergency situations;
the use of SDN-enabled SDR device, when equipped with the proper waveforms (e.g. including cognitive functions), at least as SDN switches/data planes.
The proposed SDN technologies and solutions should fulfil the following requirements:
the developed SDN solutions should address ground deployable platforms and mobile vehicles/dismounted soldiers;
the SDN solutions should be optimized for the intended use, taking into account the available computing power, the volume and weight constraints and the available power supplies;
the selected SDN technologies and the development of SDN based/enabled products should be able to form a centralized SDN architecture or a distributed architecture;
the SDN architecture should guarantee redundancy and resilience against network elements failures and network lin k loss, such as quick capability to adapt to network topology updates due to insertion of new network elements;
the SDN solutions and network architecture should consider the presence in the tactical network of UAV and UGV as network elements providing information relevant at C2 level for situational awareness and, in the future, for cyber situational awareness;
the SDN network elements should be capable to interoperate with the proper SDR device supporting the proper waveform;
the SDN solutions and network architectures should guarantee an efficient use of network resource and spectrum;
the adopted SDN network architecture should be used to carry out voice and C2 services with respect to their QoS (Quality of service) requirements.
Expected Impact:
Enhance agility, scalability and network management flexibility for tactical edge/deployable network;
Simplify policy deployment for network management, quality of service, routing, cyber defence;
Optimize the use of network resources and spectrum and rely on routing and networking traffic management strategies aiming at guaranteeing that the stringent Quality of Service requirements for the services are met on ‘per flow/service’ basis;
Increase the resilience of tactical networks, speed up reactions to network topologies changes due to instability, end user operational mission requirements, high mobility of the network nodes;
Enable cognitive networking via the interaction with SDN enabled SDR devices;
Provide network architecture solutions suitable and adoptable in tactical coalition operation by the armed forces of the involved EU Member States;
Leveraging the SDN benefits to tactical edge networking including the unmanned air and ground vehicles network segments;
Allow the sustainable evolution of the European military missions exploiting the possibility to host legacy capabilities on modern technologies, without requiring to update or change the whole network but only properly acting on the applications and their interfaces with the SDN networking elements;
Improve situational awareness and leverage on the agility enhanced by SDN solutions to defend or prevent cyber-attacks in order to enhance the security of EU tactical operations."

Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) enables commanders to have a clear understanding of the threats landscape in order to manage cyber risks during the planning and conduct phases of a military operation. In 2013, Member States identified, within the EDA (European Defence Agency) cyber defence project team, the need for capabilities to enable military commanders to put in place measures to mitigate the risk of cyber attacks at all operational levels. An important prerequisite was to provide CSA for commanders and related staff.
The analysis of the state-of-the-art in CSA suggested that there are neither commercial nor open-source CSA solutions that appropriately match the full capabilities raised by military end users, as it was echoed by EDA. Although certain capabilities might be more mature than others, all-in-one solutions are not available yet. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the proposals against this sub-topic should be complementary to any ongoing EDA project.
Scope:

In this way, they shall focus on providing operational prototypes of software suites for enabling real-time CSA that facilitate military decision-making. Contributions should introduce cognitive visualisation tools and integration with existing sensors. The system should be multi-tiered meaning information, which shall be aggregated according to the needs of the viewer at technical, operational or strategic level.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Development of cyber situational awareness technologies and defensive cyber technologies are essential to counter cyber security threats faced by Member States, in particular EU and Member States' command structures from tactical to strategic level.
Cyber attacks continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, presenting significant challenges for public or private organizations that must defend their data and systems from capable cyber threat actors. These actors range from individual, autonomous attackers to well-resourced groups operating in a coordinated manner as part of a criminal organisation or on behalf of a nation-state. Threat actors can be persistent, motivated, and agile, and use a variety of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to compromise systems, disrupt services, commit financial fraud, and expose or steal intellectual property and other sensitive information.
In order to meet the EU CSDP military level of ambition, it is necessary to develop a cyber threat information sharing and Endpoint Detection - Response framework (EDR) with extensive cyber defence and incident response capabilities.
This framework should be capable of early detecting, mitigating, responding and sharing information related to known and unknown cyber threats targeting Member States, causing detrimental effects on civilian and military missions and operations.
Scope:
Proposals shall address the feasibility, design and development of a system that is capable to provide cyber situation awareness through information sharing, combined with advanced cyber defence capabilities such as threat hunting, continuous monitoring and effective incident response to all Member States.
Targeted activities:
Proposals shall cover the feasibility study and design of the system including, but not limited to:
Feasibility study with a focus on the expected impact on the end-users;
Concept of operations (CONOPS);
System specification and architecture definition;
Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR).
Proposals shall also include the release of preliminary versions of the final deliverables to verify and test the functionality and detailed timelines and milestones to identify the progress priorities, according to operational needs of the Union and its Member States.
Main high-level requirements:
The System shall fulfil the following high-level operational requirements:
State-of-the-art system, with modern, intuitive user interface supporting military Computer Incident Response Centre (mCIRC) analysts in all their operational, technical and training needs. Usability shall be the cornerstone of the system design allowing rapid familiarization, administration, operation and training;
Use of modern techniques and information handling approaches, including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence and machine learning;
The proposed system shall be scalable and modular, focused on expanding and meeting the future operational capabilities and allowing other PESCO (Permanent Structured Cooperation) or EU defence projects to be linked, integrated or implemented through this one;
The proposed system shall be based on a modern service oriented architecture with an extensive use of open standards, allowing full compatibility with NATO and national systems, both military and civilian;
The system shall be easily deployable in different environments according to the needs of each Member State;
The system shall meet the highest information security requirements to properly control the information flows between Member States;
The system shall be able to be deployed over a variety of datacentres and COTS IT (Commercial Off-The-Shelf Information Technologies) equipment and to operate in virtualized, capable and resilient environments. It shall also be capable of easily integrating all the actors and nodes environments in conjunction with specific security equipment, such as Information Exchange Gateways (IEGs), firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDSs and IPSs), etc.;
The system shall be able to support the mCIRC availability requirements providing an open, scalable, high availability and transparent failover architecture;
The system shall be secured-by-design;
The system shall be adapted to the EU generated doctrine.
The acknowledgement of cyberspace as an active operational domain implies an increasing need for cyber threats information sharing, in order to help Member States to efficiently cope with the constantly evolving cyber threat landscape.
The proposed system shall deliver a cyber threat and incident response information sharing technology with extended cyber threat hunting and defence capabilities (EDR).
More specifically, the system shall provide:

A platform agnostic architecture;
Advanced information processing capabilities;
Multi-layer access control (restrict access to users based on their roles);
Data export features;
Built-in correlation of existing malicious TTPs;
Advanced dashboards and visualizations to endorse decision-making process.
Expected Impact:
Enhance the ability of the EU to conduct effective CSDP operations and missions in the cyberspace;
Review, extend and optimize existing information sharing mechanisms and procedures among the Member States;
Help the Member States build a cyber threat intelligence driven incident response culture (active defence – more proactive measures meaning pre-emptive actions – could be taken based on the quality of the threat intelligence);
Build a common cyber awareness culture among Member States;
Integrate CIS (Communication and Information Systems) and ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) means provided by Member States, EU forces, NATO and civil agencies;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The main challenge is to create a new generation of mobile cyber toolbox to be used by cyber rapid response teams (CRRTs) to manage cyber incidents (detect, investigate and remedy hostile activities) in defence field, as well as government environment and critical information infrastructure.
Usually, CRRTs are deployed as mobile teams to deal with cyber incidents on its premises or from remote locations, possibly with limited access to secure communication means. In the modern environment, the dependency also for military operations from civilian infrastructure (including industrial systems) and civilian solutions is growing rapidly with emerging technologies such as 5G and IoT (Internet of Things).
Although there are many rapid response initiatives and many rapid response teams formed both in civilian and military organizations, they have limitations. These teams are usually able to operate only in common enterprise environments (e.g. Microsoft and Linux based environments), have limited capabilities for specialized systems, or are dedicated to work only in organizations’ internal networks. Therefore, these teams lack skills and tools to operate in multi-site and multi-organization environments. On the other hand, they are restricted to work in their own networks by legal constraints and technological means.
Currently, a number of home-grown and relatively well-established tools and training – both commercial and open source- are available. Large companies active in cybersecurity have also built cyber toolboxes for internal and external use.
These toolsets are, however, best suited to relatively conventional scenarios and may not be convenient to use or highly effective in transnational military and government environments.
Some of the limitations include:
the packaging and architecture of such solutions, the integration with back-office investigation capabilities and the ability to face narrow network bandwidth;
the stealthiness of the deployed tools on potentially compromised networks;
the ability to face other, non-traditional types of systems, such as industrial control systems and SCADA (Supervisory control and data acquisition).
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of capabilities for CRRTs to manage effectively cyber incidents in the various above-mentioned environments and fields.
These capabilities (hardware and software) must be integrated smoothly and comprehensively in an easily deployable (including via commercial airlines) cyber toolbox.
The toolbox must address the following areas:
Data collection, reporting, and reach back
Stealthy data collection tools on potentially affected systems;
Ticketing system;
Communication platform;
Big data exchange platform;
IoC (Indicator of compromise) sharing platform.
Monitoring, log aggregation
Firewalls, IDS (Intrusion detection system)/IPS (Intrusion prevention system), including required network interface adapters, duplicators, taps, etc.;
Data collections tools and SIEM (Security information and event management);
Operating systems scanning, including deep and proven boot sanity checks of various Windows, Mac OS and Linux distributions, including in the virtualized environment;
Firmware scanning (USB, Ethernet, and WiFi-based)
Analysis and forensics capability
Analysis of the deployable tool output, including the analysis of acquired images and network traffic;
Fast, configurable data lake for logs and network activity analysis;
Connection with cyber threat intelligence.
ICS/SCADA capability
Tools required for data collection and analysis in industrial environments, addressing the most common ICS/SCADA elements’ manufacturers, protocols, interfaces, etc.;
Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing capability
Tools (hardware and software) for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study, design, prototyping and testing of the cyber toolbox, not excluding downstream activities.
The targeted activities must in particular include:
the review of the typical current capability of a CRRT, the activities such team performs, and the types of automated support that such a team needs. This must consider, among other things:
the possible functional gaps in current toolsets;
the impact of virtualized/cloud type environments on tool deployment and scalability;
the extent to which integration of different tools might simplify operator tasks and improve the effectiveness of a deployment;
the definition of a process to manage the evolution of the tools among many participating entities.
the review of the implications of operating in widely distributed and interoperable environments, in particular, considering how CRRTs operate in constrained environments such as the military deployed environment;
the review of the advanced team operating models that enable collaborative distributed activity, critically necessary to contain or manage large scale attacks enabling mission assurance, taking into account the questions of need-to-know/need-to-share and communications with command and control systems;
based on these analyses, identification of specific enhancements that must be made to current generation toolsets, processes and practices;
the design, prototyping and testing of a new generation toolset implementing these enhancements;
exercises to inform operating processes and practices across the full operating domain;
collective exercises (i.e. across multiple sites/systems/teams) to further develop operating processes and practices.
Main high-level requirements

Small UAVs, including cheap Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and easy to assemble UAS components, are widely available and their popularity is even growing.
Traditional surveillance systems fail to cope with these objects because of their characteristics. Indeed their low speed make them invisible to conventional radars, their low altitude allows them to hide amongst trees or behind buildings, their very small RF (Radio frequency), thermal and acoustic signatures makes them difficult to detect. Additionally the high manoeuvrability of some machines makes their movement hard to track once detected, and their increasing on-board processing capabilities (e.g. automated and vision based navigation, use of Artificial Intelligence) makes them more resilient to “First Generation” C-UAS systems that rely on RF detection and jamming.
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of a counter UAS capability covering detection, tracking, classification, identification, risk assessment and neutralisation of the UAS threat, taking into account task assignment and coordination.
The proposals must focus on the classes of UAVs as described in the following table (class II is optional):

The proposals must take into account the following considerations:
Threats to safety and security
Safety concerns due to the potential for recreational drones to enter unauthorized areas either by accident or negligence.
Security concerns caused by malevolent users attempting deliberately hostile missions such as the delivery of IEDs, smuggling or ISR.
Operational environment
Threats must be considered in their environmental and operational context. Mitigation options vary from civilian and military scenarios and between urban and rural settings. Solutions will differ according to the size of the area to protect, the reaction time required and the need to minimize fratricide and collateral damage. Missiles or air-burst munitions are unacceptable in a civilian context and may not be the best solution in urban peacetime environments. A soft kill approach may be required to safely take over drones carrying a suspected IED in a crowded place, notwithstanding the potential for electro-magnetic fratricide and collateral damage and notwithstanding current inability to determine the intent of an unexpected drone intrusion. However, many current soft kill solutions are likely to be ineffective against a fully autonomous UAS. Accordingly, a suite of solutions will be required to comply with a broad set of rules of engagement (RoEs) each adapted to the surrounding environment and the operational scenario (including the transition from peace-time to war-time).
Deployment
C-UAS systems must cover both fixed and deployed applications.
Fixed applications: Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) and critical infrastructures may demand continuous operation, day & night 24/7, at reasonable operational and maintenance cost.
Deployed, “pop-up” applications: Tactical military activities as well as civil events demand quick deployment with minimum logistic support, and the rapid integration of additional sensors and effectors within a recognised open architecture.
Multi-UAV Systems
Threats can occur by mean of either single or multiple UAV units, either uncoordinated or operating as a team or as a single system (swarm). Therefore, C-UAS systems must be scalable to adapt to the level of expected threat and must offer the proper reaction.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover one or more of the following activities: study, design, prototyping or testing of the proposed solution, not excluding downstream activities.
These activities must in particular cover one or more of the following:
feasibility studies, capability gaps analysis, CONOPS definition, system specification, preliminary requirements review (PRR) and architecture definition;
studies about promising technologies that nowadays have a technology readiness too low to successfully integrate and deploy in the field;
detailed design of the system, including the System Requirements Review (SRR), the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR);
Prototyping;
Testing, in relevant operational scenarios.
Main high-level requirements
The drivers for the C-UAS capability design should be:
open, flexible, modular and scalable architecture based on a plug-and-play component approach which allows deployment of specific configurations adapted to the threat scenarios;
robustness and high availability;
standard interfaces and interoperability;
day and night operational capability;
fast deployability;
minimum logistic support;
cost-effectiveness and relevance of neutralisation solutions to the characteristics of the threat and to the operational environment;
configurability of the solution for the different operational environments enabling end-users to complement/adapt as required the architecture (with more mobile/deployable components for example), to choose sensors, effectors, active areas and create tailor-made instances of the system, completely adapted to their specific needs.
The system should ensure effectiveness in the following operational scenarios:
protection of Forward Operating Bases (FOB);
protection of critical areas (with tailored approaches and deployment in case of point objective, “extended point” objectives and area objectives), including urban environment;
protection of strategic assets;
protection of moving assets (e.g. convoys, fleets, etc.).
The C-UAS systems should address all operational phases:
planning:
mission planning;
report function;
deployment:
full operational set-up.
mission conduct:
generating real time operational picture;
automated and real time warning;
modern and ergonomic graphical interface;
threat tracking;
optimal selection and activation of effectors;
threat neutralization with focus on semi-autonomous (or even manual) technical solutions (HIT (Human in the loop))
The system should fulfil the following requirements:
detect, classify, track, identify and counter UASs (single and/or multi-UAVs) in defence scenarios using multiple technologies; the ability of the proposed solution from detection to counter UASs also in civil scenarios is considered a significant plus;
deliver and update real-time operational picture and alerts;
integrate into multilayer C2 system with cross-security-domain approach;
provide a range of selective mitigation alternatives with the ability to evaluate mission success probabilities and resulting drawback;
require limited logistic support for deployment and maintenance;
require minimum operator effort for decision making;
provide dynamic scalability of sensors and effectors;
facilitate the incorporation of counter UASs in security and defence systems for fixed and deployed asset;
able to operate in a wide range of climate (e.g. arctic, subtropical) and weather (e.g. rain, fog, snow) conditions.
All the active and passive sensors and the effectors should be integrated and connected in a local command and control station. This station should implement data fusion and automatic procedures and rules in order to focus human operations on action, resources coordination and cooperation.
The proposed system should in particular include the following capabilities:
Detection, recognition, classification, identification and assessment: for these purposes the autonomous processing of information should be balanced across the adopted sensors and timely reported to the central C2 to reduce operational manpower load and bottlenecks. Solutions based on omnidirectional detection (rotating or staring) while also capable of limiting the detection to a sector of choice will be preferred for its higher flexibility of adoption;
Sensors and effectors should use communication protocols that allow “plug-and-play” deployment and should be able to operate without impacting on existing communications or position / navigation Infrastructures.
Command and control: C2 should plan and monitor subsystems’ missions and conditions, merge information from heterogeneous sensors, report about any internal or external elements that could affect the system performances, evaluate the possible engagement approaches to the operator, coordinate the engagement approach selected by the operator and report on the resulting outcomes. C2, as part of threat evaluation and weapon assignment, should compute success probability, time to complete the neutralization and drawback probabilities for each of the possible neutralization approaches. In addition, C2 should allow subsystems’ dynamic deployment and multi-instance integration. In order to allow smart and effective deployment, C2 and related subsystems should be at the lowest possible security classification level while at the same time be able to interoperate with other C2 systems (e.g. air defence systems) at higher security classification level.
Neutralization: neutralisation should include effectors compatible with the operational environment and the characteristics of the threat (including multiple UAVs elimination). These may for example include navigation systems spoofing, RF jamming, kinetic effectors (soft/hard with lethal or non-lethal effects), catch or hit-to-kill by a swarm subset or direct energy weapons (e.g. high power lasers and/or microwaves).
Expected Impact:
Stimulate the production of doctrine and CONOPS in this field;
Develop a comprehensive C-UAS capability;
Reduce the minimum reaction time;
Enhance situation awareness and protection of critical areas and strategic assets;
Ensure interoperability with existing security and defence systems."

A Global Strategy for the European Union’s Foreign And Security Policy (http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/top_stories/pdf/eugs_review_web.pdf)) defines an integrated approach to conflicts “at all stages of the conflict cycle, acting promptly on prevention, responding responsibly and decisively to crises, investing in stabilization and avoiding premature disengagement when a new crisis erupts”.
The Capability Development Plan (CDP) analysis also highlights that resilient C2 capabilities are critical enablers for Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations and missions.
Specific shortfalls concerning the fulfilment of the EU CSDP military level of ambition are a consequence of EU strategic Command, Control and Coordination (C3) at military level. This EU strategic C3 should be capable of directing, coordinating and controlling all EU CSDP actions, missions and operations, as well as civilian and military actors and forces in an integrated approach, in the full spectrum of crises – before, during and after conflicts – by managing its development, stopping ongoing conflicts and contributing to consolidating stability in the post-conflict situation.
Scope:
Proposals shall address the feasibility and design of a system that includes, in particular, the capability to conduct several simultaneous operations, with all kinds of forces, anywhere in the world, either independently or in cooperation with NATO. The Strategic C2 must integrate all kinds of Communication and Information Systems (CIS) and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) means and shall be able to interoperate with Member States, EU forces, NATO and civil agencies. The size, duration and number of simultaneous operations and deployments to be planned and conducted must be based on the EU level of ambition for CSDP missions and operations established by the Council for the MPCC.

Supporting the capabilities demanded by Joint C2, including personnel, intelligence, operations, logistics, plans, CIS and Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC);
Integrating planning information from all domains (air space management, naval operations, ground deployments, cyber situational awareness, etc.). and external systems;
Allowing the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) to effectively task its own staff and other supporting armies.
Pre-deployment:
Supporting force projection tasks in complex scenarios (infrastructures databases, etc.).
Deployment:
Monitoring deployment tasks;
Supporting the quick establishment of communications and command posts upon initial entry.
Mission conduct:
Generating real time common operational picture;
Integrating many systems for multiple domains;
Segmenting the information in the most automated way per mission;
With a strict control on the information dissemination.
Re-deployment.
Target activities:

The EU has an increasing need of geospatial information for its decision-making processes.
In this field, the use of advanced satellite-based observation assets leads to a significant increase of the operational performance of current systems.
However, the development, launch and operation of a satellite for observation purposes require a large investment and a long development timeline. In this context, platforms based on small satellites (less than 100 kg) and the use of high-performance optical observation equipment could be a suitable approach providing they can meet the right resolution, (re)visiting time and operational requirements.
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of a small satellite mission for maritime surveillance, including all mission segments (i.e. flight, ground, launch and user segments).
The proposals must in particular address the technology issues relating to:
mission design guidelines. Outline the main input parameters and variables to define the suitable mission for the maritime surveillance requirements;
system engineering and integration procedures for the different components of the satellite depending on the designed mission. Special attention should be given to the communication electronics, as well as the optical payload processing unit;
ground segment and operation requirements depending on final user surveillance needs. For example, number of images per target, revisiting frequency, etc.;
image processing aspects depending on the mission, assigned orbit and specific surveillance requirements;
satellite agility to enable the continuous acquisition of target locations, namely maritime borders or coastlines.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study and design of a small satellite mission for maritime surveillance, not excluding downstream activities.
The targeted activities must in particular include:
a feasibility study and the preliminary requirements, determining and examining the mission objectives.
Mission Definition Review (MDR). Having obtained the mission statement, a certain mission for a maritime border or coastline must be proposed as a use-case for the small satellite system;
Preliminary Requirements Review (PRR). Preliminary technical specification of the mission defined in the MDR phase and confirmation of the technical and programmatic feasibility of the system and operations concept;
Systems Requirement Review (SRR) consolidating technical specifications at system level for the defined mission in the MDR phase. The PRR and SRR imply the identification of some lead users to state and validate such requirements;
the design phase. Providing the mission and the system requirements are defined, the system design must be subject to two consecutive activities:
Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The proposed design will be validated against the established system requirements for the proposed mission;
Critical Design Review (CDR). This activity will demonstrate that the system’s design can be implemented into a functional prototype and the subsequent industrial scale-up.
These activities must also include:
the analysis of an integrated and synergic approach for the use of small satellites versus traditional EO satellites, with focus on SAR-Optical federation for IMINT, not excluding SIGINT solutions;
the capability to operate an optical payload providing resolutions about 1 m or below in panchromatic and RGB (Red, green and blue), the electronics in charge of the on-board image processing (i.e. super-resolution algorithms), thermal and power control, as well as the mission design including ground segment and communication requirements;
the selection criteria for the adequate launcher and operational requirements for the chosen orbit(s).
Main high-level requirements
The proposed work should fulfil the following requirements:
identification of the opto-mechanical requirements for the optical payload taking into account the constraints of using a small satellite platform (less than 100 kg in total);
selection of the adequate electronics for the detectors (e.g. CMOS technology) and the on-board control and processing (e.g. FPGA or GPU-based systems);
definition of the alignment and calibration procedures of the camera for future prototyping and industrial scale-up;
specification of the power unit and the corresponding control system, following the requirements of the chosen mission operations concept;
specification of the thermal control requirements for the system considering the selected orbit and mission conditions (e.g. passing time and time of observation over target);
selection of the orbit and the maximum tilt off-nadir for the satellite, including the strategy to track a coastline or maritime border. The camera FOV / FOR (Field of View / Field of Regard) will be requirements to be addressed for the chosen orbit;
analysis and requirements for attitude control actuators of the satellite platform. In this mission it implies specific requirements (e.g. for the reaction wheels to be used under the mission conditions);
star tracker requirements should be also considered regarding the high satellite attitude knowledge and pointing precision needed to meet the operational requirements;
specific requirements for on-board image processing, including super-resolution algorithms and compression of the resulting images for downloading;
the requirements for the communication electronics and antennas will be stated for a certain download channel, assuming the system will be operating under high-throughput conditions;
downlink requirements should be carefully taken into account, including the design of the ground segment (e.g. number and location of the ground stations), satellite TTC (Telemetry, Tracking and Command) and operation and post-processing of the image to meet the surveillance awareness requirements;
analysis and requirements for automatic data processing to enable maritime borders and coastlines monitoring, by taking advantage of the experience gathered by EU industry in providing services to the market;
analysis of a federation oriented approach between small and traditional satellites;
the overall system and software architecture will be defined to set the base for future ISVV (Independent System/Software Verification and Validation), as part of the scale-up of the system;
the estimate of the small satellite lifetime should also be provided taking into account that some of the selected components are expected to be “commercial-off-the-shelf”. De-orbiting should comply with the accepted standards.
The system architecture of the small satellite for maritime surveillance mission should take into consideration all necessary future elements for full capabilities deployment, and in particular:
the system operation under constellations for the specific mission to be defined. This will lead to additional requirements for the system’s data downlink and operation;
the type and features of the launchers to be considered to meet the coverage and revisit requirements. The selected orbits and targets will be a key factor since some orbit deployment strategies may require a dedicated launch or propulsion, with the corresponding cost implications;
the development of applications for agile processing of the images downloaded in a quasi-real time scheme. The computing capacity could grow in a significant way depending on the amount of information and the final users’ demand; hence, AI and Big Data processing techniques could be also included in this analysis.
Expected Impact:
Development of critical capabilities for EU CSDP;
Efficiency improvement of the European defence;
Reinforcement of the interoperability of EU Member States armed forces and security agencies (i.e. FRONTEX);
Improvement of the coordination and cooperation in investment, capabilities development and operative availability;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The ground combat is one of the eleven EU capability priorities identified as part of the revised 2018 CDP. This assessment acknowledges the necessity to further develop existing land battlefield missile systems.
Moreover, the development of an EU new generation medium range Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) land battlefield missile systems family has been identified as an objective within the EU BLOS Land Battlefield Missile Systems project of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). There is a need to develop a capability providing a high degree of accuracy while avoiding widespread collateral damage, and reducing exposure of friendly forces.
The EU is facing increasing geopolitical instability and a complex set of conventional and new threats. Therefore, the armed forces of the Member States need the ability to operate autonomously or, as a valuable contributor, within an ad-hoc coalition. They have to intervene in a high intensity and in asymmetric engagement, facing a wide range of threats including potential technically advanced adversaries. Moreover, some requirements are becoming increasingly important:
Providing the land combat units with the ability to defeat at medium range, with a high degree of accuracy and reliability, selected threats that are not always clearly identified and visible, especially in a urban environment, or defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment;
Reducing exposure to enemy fire;
Avoiding widespread collateral damage;
Allowing concentrating fires without concentrating means, providing autonomy, reactivity and freedom of action on the battlefield.
In this context, the European BLOS capability will bring a significant operational differentiator to the armed forces of the Member States. Such a capability can be mounted or dismounted on manned and unmanned land platforms, in consistence with the CDP long term analysis which identifies the need to deploy automated effectors to reduce the danger on human personnel or manned platforms.
Several products and technologies currently exist or are under development in Europe but they need to be integrated in order to achieve this BLOS capability:
A land battlefield missile system, BLOS native with a full Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capability, and providing Man-In-The-Loop (MITL) through a seeker back-image for over watch and control during the whole flight of the missile;
A turret system to support and set up the missile using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for target designation;
A land platform;
A UAV providing a cyber-secured target location.
In order to guarantee freedom of operational use, capacity to implement further evolutions over time, and standardization of those interfaces with other EU land battle systems, the European BLOS capability has to be built without restraints and restriction from third country or third country entity, in particular regarding IPR and know-how, and must be free of any third party control regime.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The objective of this topic is to pave the way for a European independent solution providing 155 mm 52-calibre artillery with very long range, high precision and heavy payload ammunition. The proposed solutions must address future challenges such as increasing action range beyond the range of potential near-par threats, decreasing dramatically collateral damages, operating in a GNSS-denied environment, providing ammunition with an improved targeting capability and potentially in-flight retargeting to provide maximum flexibility and safety of use for friend troops.
Therefore, the contemplated future ammunition will bring several advantages over current limited and partially non-sovereign solutions.
Technologies and functions developed under this topic will be also available for rocket artillery since they address the same challenges regarding precision, range, effectiveness and operation on a GNSS-denied battlefield.
Scope:
The proposals must address the development of a very long range (> 60 km), high precision and heavy payload ammunition.
Deliverables are expected within 24 months from the signature of the grant agreement.
Targeted activities
The proposals must cover the study and design of the proposed solution, not excluding downstream activities.
The targeted activities must in particular include:
feasibility studies encompassing: terminal effect rough assessment, ammunition architecture choices regarding propelling system, projectile and warhead type, interface with gun and artillery system integration;
preliminary design of a complete ammunition;
the provision of a roadmap for subsequent development phases (e.g. functional demonstrator to be tested in a proven 155 mm 52-calibre artillery and available technologies for future rocket artillery).
Main high-level requirements
The ammunition should fulfil the following requirements:
interoperability between EU Member States and NATO countries. Especially, the 155 mm ammunition should be compliant with the Artillery JB MOU (Joint ballistic Memorendum of understanding) and be tested in a proven 155 mm 52-calibre artillery;
every technology and component developed to address the above challenge should be capable of being integrated into an artillery rocket. Therefore, technical specifications at all stages should encompass the two categories of ammunition. It is expected that the stress put on compactness and resistance to the extreme thermo-mechanical environment of a 155 mm artillery shell will enable technologies and components to withstand the environment of an artillery rocket;
the ammunition should provide a terminal precision below the 10 m (CEP@50) range, in all weather conditions. It will be flight-guided by GNSS and/or inertial measurement unit and/or any cost-effective means, and it will resistant to jamming in GNSS-denied environment over the battlefield thanks to Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) solution or any other means;
the ammunition guidance and navigation should be GPS and Galileo compatible, without creating any non-EU restriction of use;
terminal guidance should be based on SAL (Semi active laser) and/or IIR (Imaging infrared) / imagery system or any other solution to be affordable and effective against moving or stationary targets;
the ammunition (shell or rocket) should be programmable before firing to realize the mission, with minimum interference with the gun system as far as the 155 mm is concerned. In-flight re-targeting capability (including mission change and/or a mission abort when needed) should be assessed for the different categories of ammunition.
ammunition safety of use should be as high as possible, as per the best standards related to life duration and insensitiveness to aggressions. Especially, compliance with NATO STANAG 4439 (related to insensitive munition) and STANAG 4187 (related to safety) should be ensured as far as possible;
high robustness against jamming;
regarding range, the ability to attack the enemy in depth, to strike at counter-fire and target high value targets is a should. The highest possible range should be sought;
in particular for the 155 mm, the purpose is to double the standard range of most existing 155 mm 52-calibre artillery, i.e. to raise it from approximately 40 km to 80 km or more. A minimum threshold of requirement is 60 km
such extended range should be achieved for deep fire missions with high accuracy, as well as to provide area effects;
the ammunition warhead should be effective against soft targets, light vehicles, small buildings, and should be capable of incapacitating armoured vehicles. Accordingly, warhead and terminal effect should be optimized (scalable effect depending on target objectives); the use of insensitive explosive (HE IM (High explosive insensitive munition), MURAT 1* (1 star marked « Munitions à risques atténués »)) is requested, as far as possible. When not possible, this has to be justified;
terminal phase characteristics (i.e. fuse and warhead architecture) should be determined according to the kind of effect considered. Typical options for activation are impact, delayed impact and predefined altitude;
performances should be achieved without modifying the requirement of existing European artillery rocket launchers and 155 mm 52-calibre artillery guns.
Note: International standards as JB MOU covers only basic interface characteristics. Further safety analysis and testing will be required ahead of in-servicing, to be planned in a later phase out of the current scope. The approach regarding rockets is similar.
Expected Impact:
Availability of an affordable and cost effective artillery ammunition, with performances beyond any current solution
Contribution to the strategic autonomy of the European Union and of its industrial base: sovereign key technologies will allow this cutting-edge armament to be used on the battlefield regardless of non-European technologies, components and services, whenever and wherever required, and will provide complete freedom of exportation within the frame of the licenses which may be granted by European bodies and/or participating countries;
Improved competitiveness due to new market opportunities;
Reduction, through commonality and mass production, of the acquisition and life-cycle costs for each Member State;
Contribution to increased interoperability and potential European standards;
Reduction of the logistic burden of European military land forces;
Reduction of the cost of European military missions."

This topic intends to develop European standardized Galileo Public Regulated Service (PRS) receiver technological capabilities, compatible with dual mode GPS/PRS GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiving equipment for military applications in air, land, naval and possibly space domains and achieving full compliance with the EU Common Minimum Standards (CMS).
First satellite navigation systems, e.g. GPS, were designed under military requirements and budget to improve defence capabilities. They revolutionised military applications by providing accurate position, velocity and time/synchronisation information for all military assets worldwide, in all weather conditions, with a common time and geodetic reference frame supporting the essential interoperability requirement. Galileo has been developed to guarantee Europe’s strategic autonomy in Satellite navigation. The Galileo PRS has been developed as a robust, secure and resilient PNT service even in case of denial of the other GNSS services. Interoperable and compatible with GPS, the PRS will provide the EU military users state-of-the-art satellite navigation performance, robustness and interoperability and, when combined with GPS, an even higher level of resilience for military use.
The CDP points to the need to promote the development of robust, secure and resilient EU military PNT capabilities. To achieve this objective in time (with regard to the Galileo PRS Full Orbital Capability (FOC) foreseen by 2023), operational EU military PRS receivers, associated to their antennas and key management facilities as well as service architectures and test and support facilities, need to be developed and those developments cannot be supported by the private sector, because of the high investment cost. In addition, the development of military standardized Galileo PRS receiver interfaces has been identified as an objective within the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). This standardisation will ensure the development of the EU market by facilitating the integration of PRS receivers into the armament systems. It will then increase the competitiveness and growth of the defence industry for those armament systems (the satellite navigation capabilities embedded are one of the criteria of choice for armament systems within the military market).
The EU activities supported so far have been feasibility studies, design activity and accreditation of one pre operational prototype.
Therefore, the challenge is to develop EU operational prototypes of PRS receivers with standardized interfaces, to be qualified and tested by FOC (2023) within at least one host platform. Testing in standardized and controllable test facilities as well as in a real environment with in-field demonstrations implementing real/realistic service architecture must be scheduled with the involvement of defence user communities.
Scope:
Proposals shall address the development of European standardized and sovereign Galileo PRS navigation receiver capabilities compatible with GPS/PRS solution for military purposes in air, land, naval domains developed in full conformity with the EU Common Minimum Standards (CMS) from prototyping up to qualification or test.

Standardization of interface for PRS receivers;
Key management, PRS security management and other PRS information management capability;
Services architectures for test and support facilities;
Security certification.
The tests shall be performed in standardized support facilities guaranteeing a controlled environment and afterwards in operational conditions with the operational Galileo system and real/realistic service architecture to demonstrate the real capability of the PRS receivers developed. The possibility to consider space domain may be addressed in the proposals.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover all the necessary activities for the prototyping, testing and qualification on different platforms (naval, land, airborne) of PRS receivers, encompassing in particular:

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In today’s military applications supported by satellite communications, security, information assurance and link efficiency technologies are inextricably linked. Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, cyber security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.
Member States are increasingly pooling and sharing their defence efforts to increase their strategic autonomy in a geopolitical context, overcome new security risks with enhanced military capabilities, and create a more competitive and integrated defence industry.
In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.
The complexity of dispersed operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite types and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security is the key feature belonging to all those requirements that in addition need to be met in the most efficient way.
However, these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber attacks against military satellite communication networks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.
A key element to reply to this security challenge is the satellite communication waveform, which needs to be as protected and secure as possible.
Different initiatives to make satellite communications more secure and reliable through the creation of (proprietary) protected waveforms have already been undertaken and/or are ongoing within the military context. Yet the results of those initiatives are used only in sovereign national satellite networks of some major nations, driven and supported by big international industrial players.
The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context.
The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multi-national development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).
Scope:
The EPW shall be able to operate in this complex military operational environment and bring a solution to the challenges described.
Proposals should address feasibility, design and development of an EPW for satellite communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions) with five key considerations in mind.
European autonomy and cooperation between Member States
The EPW shall be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technology for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it shall allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context in order to exchange mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.
Affordable and efficient satellite services
The EPW shall be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (Operational expenditure) (reduce bandwidth costs, need for less resources for planning) and CAPEX (Capital expenditure) (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems.
The EPW shall include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g. DVB-S2X (Extension to Digital Video Broadcasting – Satellite Second generation standard) waveform standard) in combination with the latest security technology. There shall no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands shall be achieved even with small terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.
Flexibility and scalability
The EPW shall be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO (Low Earth Orbit), MEO (Medium Earth Orbit), GEO (Geostationary Equatorial Orbit), high-throughput systems, spot beams, regional and global beams) and different network architectures (VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal), SCPC (Single Channel Per Carrier), mesh). At the same time, the EPW shall be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications from low to very high data rates.
Innovation
The EPW development shall not just be a copy and paste of existing solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal shall be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW program shall be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.
Security and resilience
The main feature of the EPW shall be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development shall focus on building satellite links that are resistant to cyber attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric conditions or on-the-move communication challenges shall be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity shall investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different government and defence end-users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover the initial phases of the development of the EPW including in particular:
Feasibility study, threat analysis, CONOPS definition, system specification, Detailed Requirements Review (DRR) and architecture definition;
Detailed design of the system, including the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and finishing with the Critical Design Review (CDR);
The development of small-scale technological demonstrators with military end-users in an operational environment, in order to support decision making during the design phase.
The end state shall be an EPW standard for satellite communication (comparable to other communication waveform standards) that can be implemented by nations or industry on their individual baseband solutions.
Main high-level requirements:
The EPW development shall fulfil requirements at the level of both the waveform and the satellite baseband equipment (terminals, modems, hubs, networks). The demarcation point is the edge router of the satellite network which connects the hubs, gateways and modems with outside networks or the internet.
Baseband equipment requirements:
The right implementation of the terminal will determine the success of the EPW. The flexibility and the affordability of the terminal are key considerations. Hence the preference for Software Defined Radio (SDR) type of equipment;
The baseband infrastructure (hubs and modems) needs to cover multiple architecture types of networks (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, mesh) and satellite (wideband, spot beam, mix of both) architectures;
The EPW shall operate on SDR hardware from different vendors that will be selected by nations, government and defence agencies or institutions, depending on their preference or acquisition processes;
The EPW shall include the ability to receive and transmit various modulation methods using a common set of hardware. A modem could also run the EPW and a proprietary or DVB standard waveform on the same platform and switch waveforms, if needed;
The EPW shall be future-proof and easy to upgrade – the ability to alter functionality by downloading and running new software at will, in order to repurpose the modem for a new application;
The EPW shall be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, save resources for planning) and CAPEX (save on equipment cost) compared to existing expensive military satellite modems;
The EPW shall consider Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints for on-the-pause and on-the-move platforms and shall be easy to transport;
The EPW shall be deployable in different environment conditions and on different platforms (land, sea or air);
The EPW shall be available in different form factors (OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) cards, rack units or rugged terminals);
The EPW shall be license-based to cater for different level of users;
The EPW shall be transparent for national encryption standards and externally encrypted data, and capable of integrating on-board encryption technology;
The EPW shall be capable of introducing dedicated authentication certificates;
The EPW shall be reliable to ensure continuity of operations;
The EPW shall have performances considering the throughput demands of today and the future;
The EPW shall support pooling and sharing service models of both waveform and equipment that can be implemented for different operations.
Protected waveform requirements
The EPW shall:
Be defined as a standard to enable interoperability. Multiple terminal vendors must be able to support the EPW and be compatible, even on a minimum basis;
Be affordable, based on the best practices of COTS and government or military-grade waveforms;
Implement the latest SATCOM efficiency technology to obtain the best performance out of a satellite link;
Support a range of different satellite constellations (HTS (High Throughput Satellites), wideband, military, commercial, government, GEO, MEO, LEO), satellite architectures (pure transponder, partially or fully processed) and frequency bands (C-band, X-band, Ku-band, Ka-band);
Be easy to port on other SDR modems or hubs;
Flexible to support multiple governmental and defence applications that require different levels of security;
Consider a growing amount of on-the-move and on-the-pause platforms connected over the satellite with a need for mobility features (Doppler compensations, spreading modulation, small and flat antenna support, beam switching, beam hopping, etc.);
Operate in GPS-denied environments;
Provide adequate protection against intrusion, hacking, jamming, traffic monitoring and eavesdropping;
Consider a wide range of throughput requirements and satellite bandwidth sizes (symbol rates);
Offer seamless and resilient satellite links against fading effects, interference (intentional and unintentional), shadowing effects and jamming (fixed and sweeping);
Be capable of supporting different service models such as pooling and sharing.
Expected Impact:
Availability of a critical enabler for CSDP operations and missions in providing scalable secure and resilient communications in peacetime and during operations with protection against intrusion, hacking, jamming, traffic monitoring and eavesdropping;
Full interoperability between different demanders and suppliers of satellite communication in support of military operations and missions;
Secure, guaranteed and affordable access to satellite communications for all Member States;
Strongly increased European autonomy in satellite communication for defence users and no longer dependency on support from outside the EU for the transmission and exchange of mission critical and sensitive information;
State-of-the-art technological solution in line with the latest satellite innovations and initiatives such as 5G, small LEO/MEO satellites, connected vehicles and Internet of things."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European strategy and co-operation in developing autonomous land systems has to be ambitious for EU troops to effectively engage, protect, deploy, sustain and command in the future battlefield. Specific challenges include:
The reduced acceptance of loss of human life in society leads to expectations that future conflicts must be fought using combined unmanned and autonomous systems to accomplish missions with the least possible risk to soldiers;
Collateral damage risks increase due to population density in operational theatres and require an accurate, up-to-date common operational picture and adequate information management for precise targeting;
New weapon systems (laser, acoustic, railguns, etc.) provide new opportunities, but on the other hand lead to new requirements and demands for force protection and operational security;
Emerging technologies allow building greater overmatch distances to affect adversaries and, on the other hand, require advanced force protection measures against adversaries’ assets.
There is therefore an increasing need to deploy unmanned systems to reduce the danger to civilian populations, armed forces personnel, manned platforms, as well as to increase robustness, sustainability and resilience of ground systems. The Capability Development Plan (CDP) analysis confirms this by prioritizing developing unmanned ground combat capabilities and systems with evolving levels of autonomy.
Scope:
Proposals shall address design or prototyping of a system, not excluding upstream and downstream activities, which should:
Include a system capable of manned-unmanned and unmanned-unmanned teaming with other robotic unmanned aerial and ground platforms as well as traditional manned vehicles to provide combat support and combat service support to ground forces;
Increase situational awareness and force protection of ground units, their combat effectiveness, endurance, mobility and autonomy, and enable faster deployment;
Have the ability to be deployed in support of dismounted troops in all types of geographic and operational environments (including denied environments) with evolving levels of autonomy and robustness for transport and supply delivery, force protection, interdiction, ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance), communication relay, military engineering support, medical evacuation or CBRN protection;
Lower workload for UGS operator(s) through maximum use of artificial intelligence and assisted functions (e.g. autonomous mobility, automatic target/threat detection/tracking/prioritization), in order to assure better awareness of the tactical situation for UGS operator(s) (information superiority in a network enabled scenario);
Include modular design and interoperability of the UGS, in order to ensure transferability of the relevant technology to other platforms (including existing manned vehicles) and simplify payload integration during the follow-up development projects.
Proposals can also include the integration of an increased number of unmanned systems (swarming) to be remotely operated by human beings.
Targeted activities:
The proposals shall cover at least the design of a multipurpose unmanned ground system, not excluding upstream and downstream activities, such as feasibility study or prototyping and testing in an operational environment.
Main high-level requirements:
The system shall meet the following general requirements:
Be designed for operations encompassing the entire spectrum of conflicts from permissive to denied environments, by day, night and in adverse weather conditions;
Provide, when necessary, in addition to functioning as part of mechanized troops, advanced mobility and a reduced footprint allowing systems to support dismounted troops in different environments, where traditional manned vehicles are not able to operate;
Support all types of missions of infantry units without compromising their stealth and endurance;
According to the UGS weight class, have design elements for protection which address the appropriate threats;
Be equipped with cyber secure and Electronic Warfare (EW) resilient C2;
Have a modular, open, scalable and cyber-secure architecture for different manned and unmanned capabilities;
Provide a modular architecture for future upgrades and implementation of different autonomous functions;
Be capable of manoeuvring autonomously to pre-planned battle positions and have the ability to carry at least a squad sized unit equipment;
Have autonomous functions for unmanned ground systems' LOS (Line Of Sight) and BLOS (Beyond Line Of Sight) missions;
Be based on a ground vehicle on which a variety of payloads can be mounted to support various mission functionalities: transport, fire-support, ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), EW and cyber, etc. The sensors and communication systems of the ground vehicle shall have the capability to be integrated into broader networks;
Ensure that autonomy related capabilities, that can cause collateral damage, are restricted to human-in-the-loop or human-on-the-loop common control in order to minimize collateral damage risks ensure operations under rules of engagements.
Expected Impact:
Enhanced interoperability between armed forces of Member States;
Increased situational awareness and force protection of ground units, their combat effectiveness, endurance, mobility and autonomy to enable faster deployment, and to enhance the interoperability and affordability of ground forces;
Faster decision-making and significantly increased resilience and protection of soldiers in any environment;
Contribution to rebuild a credible deterrent in terms of land combat capability, by introducing in the shortest time the right number of advanced logistic and combat vehicles in general as well as CSPS and introducing the unique capabilities of UGS to operate in high risk scenarios;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Consumers should be considered at the heart of the energy system and become active market players. The future private consumer should be more aware, active, energy sufficient, as well as being a prosumer producing energy for their own consumption, where this is possible. Furthermore, in view of the fluctuation in energy prices, consumers are spending an increasing share of their income on energy, with estimates stating that more than 50 million Europeans are affected by energy poverty[1]. Energy efficiency, energy savings and increased use of locally produced, including own produced, renewable energy are key tools in addressing fuel poverty.
In this context, engagement actions are needed across Europe in order to achieve behavioural change towards more sustainable choices and decisions for energy. This includes increasing and understanding consumer 'apetite' for higher efficiency products.
Although awareness on the benefits of collective consumer action in the field of EE and RES has increased in past years, such action is still hampered by a number of barriers, including financial and regulatory barriers and inconsistencies in grid integration practice. In addition, insufficient use of relevant ICT solutions and insufficient understanding of energy bills contribute to hampering the achievement of a more sustainable energy system.
Scope:
Develop and roll out tailored and effective and innovative engagement actions to motivate changes in consumers' sustainable energy behaviour that would result in reduced energy consumption in buildings, heating/cooling systems and/or appliances. The proposed actions should focus on clearly defined target groups of private consumers (individuals or collectives), using market segmentation[2]. The proposed actions should demonstrate an understanding of different types of behaviours and consider the different approaches needed to influence them. The actions should also address the risk of ""rebound effects"", propose measures to counteract them, and apply current theory and practice on consumer decision making processes (e.g. effects of new technologies on energy behaviour). All relevant stakeholders necessary for the successful implementation of the action should be involved and it is expected that relevant consumer organisations, in particular, are either directly involved or their support is clearly demonstrated in the proposal. Where relevant for the proposed action, gender issues should be taken into account, in particular the role gender characteristics may play in influencing consumer behaviour. Actions should preferably cover a wide geographic area through complementary actions covering various parts of the EU. In addition the proposed actions, when relevant, should include policy lessons from the action to contribute to policy development.
The proposed action should cover one or more of the following:
Empower and facilitate actions for consumers to become prosumers, or to form collective consumer groups/consumer cooperatives (addressing energy efficiency and/or renewable energy, and energy storage, where applicable, with a focus on action).
Support clearly defined groups of vulnerable consumers in tackling fuel poverty by facilitating more sustainable energy behaviour and choices in their everyday life, without compromising comfort levels. This should also aim at achieving structural changes of national policies to specifically address fuel poverty and could include the transfer of best practices for the active engagement of vulnerable consumers.
Facilitate wider deployment and consumer adoption of existing ICT-based solutions, for energy efficiency and information on energy consumption and costs, with a focus on action and resulting in improved understanding of ICT interfaces and information depiction (including smart metering and related systems).
Facilitate consumer understanding of energy bills (on and off line), leading to actions allowing for a reduction in energy consumption. Such actions should ensure robust monitoring to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed,
Create better instruments for improving consumer understanding and routing purchase decisions towards higher efficiency products, without compromising comfort levels, and with no additional relevant environmental impacts,
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below (wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets), depending on the scope of the proposal:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project within its duration (in GWh/year per million Euro of EU funding);
Number of people changing their behaviour and taking informed decisions, documenting why and how changes are an effect of particular measures taken, as well in terms of the sustainability of the behavioural change;
Number of consumers engaged by actions aiming at improving consumer understanding and routing purchase decisions towards higher efficiency products;
Renewable Energy production and Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project within its duration (for actions on prosumers/consumers groups, respectively in GWh/year and million Euro of investments per million Euro of EU funding);
Policies and strategies created/adapted to include fuel poverty (for actions on fuel poverty), to be measured in number of citations / statements from governance bodies.
Cross-cutting Priorities:

By 2020 full implementation of the EU product efficiency legislation should be one of the most important contributions to the EU energy efficiency target. The Ecodesign Directive alone should yield yearly savings of up to 600 TWh of electricity and 600 TWh of heat in 2020, as well as net savings for European consumers and businesses of €90 billion per year – 1% of EU’s current GDP – in year 2020 (meaning net savings of €465 per household per year). Non-compliance with these rules is estimated to reduce these savings by at least 10%. Previous initiatives have demonstrated the usefulness of market surveillance activities. However to ensure full implementation of product efficiency legislation, these activities should be improved.
The enforcement of energy efficient products regulations should also take into account other relevant environmental impacts (e.g. emissions, noise) in order not to adversely influence peoples’ quality of life.
The challenge is thus to:
improve market surveillance activities.
Scope:
Provide support for joint surveillance actions. Proposals should focus on building up the monitoring, verification and enforcement of the EU's energy-related products policy, in particular for those products that represent the highest energy saving potential and with lower compliance rates or those regulated products that represent new challenges for market surveillance (e.g. newly regulated products or ones where new challenges arise such as suspected use of defeat devices) and therefore may require new approaches and methods for monitoring, verification and enforcement. Proposals should support higher level of surveillance activities and go beyond product testing. They should not replace activities that are under the responsibility of Member States, but should add European value to them (e.g. execution of joint activities, exchange of information, development of common methods, protocols or checklists, etc.). Actions must include the relevant market surveillance authorities[1] at least one per participating country, in their consortia. Actions should also involve consumers’ (or other end users') associations as appropriate, and demonstrate a high transnational added value. Actions should take stock of previous EU-funded work on monitoring, verification and enforcement, combining and leveraging relevant results to a much wider audience across the EU. Proposals should consider the use of databases to record actions' results on specific product models, notably existing databases used by market surveillance authorities and/or developed in previous EU-funded work.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","15 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy and fuels represent between 20% and 40% of the production costs in several Resource and Energy Intensive Industries (REII). A lot of technical progresses were already done in REII to reduce the energy consumption of the main industrial products. Nevertheless, significant parts of the input-energy are still lost in the form of waste heat by gas, liquid or solid streams.
Those losses occur because either the corresponding heat losses are difficult to recover and re-use in the process itself or in another part of the production process or the required equipment are too costly (low ROI).
The challenge is to design, build, test & demonstrate new processes/components or innovative adaptation of existing solutions for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems.
Furthermore, sources of heat losses for a given industry could be a valuable resource for another one, directly or after an intermediate transformation step. By reusing waste and residual heat in a more efficient way primary energy can be saved. This topic responds to the needs of the process industry identified in the roadmap of the SPIRE cPPP (Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency contractual Public-Private Partnership).
Scope:
Actions should improve the energy efficiency of large industrial systems by designing economically viable industrial solutions based on innovative technologies for recovery of waste heat or the innovative adaptation of already existing solutions for waste heat recovery. Actions should address the recovery of waste heat from streams from industrial processes (e.g. waste streams, by-products, intermediates) or from surplus heat in plant parameters to transform it in useful energy forms, including the production of technical gases (e.g. oxygen, hydrogen) to be used in the industrial process itself or exported as by-products. Solutions should be adaptable to various types of industrial processes and should be validated by full scale demonstration in real production conditions in industrial facilities.
Actions could either propose innovative technologies for the efficient recovery of waste heat in large industrial systems or innovative solutions of energy symbiosis between industries or plants inside industrial parks for the valorisation of waste and residual heat. Only one or the other should be addressed by the proposed actions.
For actions proposing innovative technologies for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems one or more of the following technological issues should be addressed:
The intermittent character of the recoverable energy flows and its variations during normal operating conditions e.g. adapted storage to smooth these variations (such as low materials cost with high thermal inertia, Phase Change Materials, commodities storage, etc.);
Achieving safe, controlled and efficient recovery of heat from media, which are very difficult to handle and control (high temperature, high volumes, highly aggressive- fouling/deposits/corrosion);
The transfer of energy flows from a process line to the other one, and investigating the potential use of recovered energy in other processes with various heat transfer media (water/steam, oil, salts, gases….);
The influences of the new heat recovery process on the product quality (e.g. dry cooling instead of wet cooling);
Actions proposing innovative solutions of energy symbiosis between industries or plants inside large industrial parks for the valorisation of waste heat should cover, if possible, all the following points:
To analyse, characterise and assess the sources of energy losses in the spirit of reusing them in other plants or industries (e.g. amount, composition, temperature, impurity and fluctuation have to be taken into account, improving the global environmental impact, and new measurements and models could be needed to identity them) and to identify the relevant heat and energy demands;
To determine and demonstrate flexible solutions to coordinate the sources and demands and to optimise the energy fluxes between the different plants and industries. Interactions between the industrial site and the surroundings should be taken into account as an additional opportunity for valorisation of waste/residual heat. New management systems for the energy loss fluxes have to be developed;
To determine and demonstrate innovative storage technologies and strategies to harmonize energy use for fluctuating inputs (e.g. wind, converter gas) and variable (batch) process demands and to exploit the variations of the hourly electricity price;
To determine and demonstrate innovative conversion technologies and strategies to improve the accordance of demands and sources of energy;
To define the most suitable energy carriers to be implemented at the proper scale in the environment representative of industrial application.
New management systems for the waste energy fluxes have to be developed basing on the parameters and models described above.
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 5-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
For 2016 only:
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
For 2017 only:
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between:
EUR 4-5 million for actions proposing innovative technologies for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems
EUR 5-6 million for actions proposing innovative solutions for energy symbiosis between industries or plants inside large industrial parks for the valorisation of waste heat (more complex and costly actions)
would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed actions are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets, wherever possible.
For actions proposing innovative technologies for waste heat recovery in large industrial systems:
Recovery of at least 40% of the sensible heat contained in each waste heat carrier addressed by the project.
Measureable substantial primary energy savings clearly quantified and substantiated, and subsequent reduction of CO2 emissions
The improvement of the energy efficiency and the reduction of energy cost will lead to a demonstrated advancement in competitiveness by the end of the project. This will expand the available portfolio of energy resources and technologies, which can be integrated within sites, across sectors and along value chains.
For actions proposing innovative solutions of energy symbiosis between industries or plants inside large industrial parks for the valorisation of waste heat:
Recovery of at least 40% of waste heat.
Measureable substantial primary energy savings, clearly quantified and substantiated, and subsequent reduction of CO2 emissions.

Twinning must be understood in largo sensu, thus referring to the municipalities which signed or are engaged to sign twinning agreements as well as to the municipalities having other forms of partnerships fostering their cooperation and cultural links."

Who should apply to FTI, the Fast Track to Innovation?
Are you looking for partners that can help you with a fast go-to-market of an industry-driven, innovative concept that has strong potential to make your company grow and scale-up?
Do you see co-creation or open innovation as ways to advance your innovation cycle and enter the market within three years?
Are you looking for substantial funding to test, demonstrate and validate your innovation with users before full commercial roll-out, potentially via a spin-off company or a joint venture?
Then FTI is the scheme for you.
Innovation is fostered when new ideas can emerge and easily translate into socio-economic value, shaping new markets and laying the foundations of a stronger, high-tech industrial base for Europe.
Working together, partners with complementary backgrounds, knowledge and skills, in both new and established value-chains, can turn ideas into world-beating products, processes and services that tackle societal challenges.
FTI accelerates the market uptake of ground-breaking innovations by providing funding in an open, accessible scheme that nurtures ideas from consortia of innovators of all types and sizes from across Europe.
Participation by industry — defined as private-for-profit organisations — is mandatory; industry is best-placed to ensure the due commercial exploitation of the innovation developed; in addition, company growth and development in order to strengthen Europe's industrial leadership are explicitly pursued with FTI support.
Scope:
Principles and funding of FTI
FTI supports actions undertaking innovation from the demonstration stage through to market uptake, including activities such as piloting, test-beds, systems validation in real-world working conditions, validation of business models, pre-normative research, and standard-setting.
The maximum EU contribution per action is €3 million (funding rate: 70% for for-profit entities; 100% for not-for-profit entities).
FTI targets relatively mature, ground-breaking new technologies, concepts, processes and business models that need final development to be able to shape a new market and achieve wider deployment.
If your proposal involves technological innovation, your consortium should declare that the technology or the technologies concerned are at least at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. The intention will be to bring the TRL up to 8 for technological innovations and to an analogous level of maturity for non-technological innovations during the lifetime of the FTI action. TRLs are described in General Annex G of the work programme.
FTI actions are encouraged to be interdisciplinary, cutting across different sector and technologies. Actions supporting innovative concepts that have the potential to disrupt or to create new markets are particularly welcome.
In your proposal, you should:
Specify the intended outcome and describe key performance indicators and success criteria.
Make reference to and incorporate a business plan clearly describing the market potential, business opportunities for participants, measures to enhance the probability of eventual commercial take-up, and a credible commercialisation strategy that identifies next steps and specifies other actors to be involved.
Pay particular attention to IP protection and ownership and to the possibility of commercial exploitation (often known as 'freedom to operate').
Specify the expected impact in terms of competitiveness and growth of the business partners in the consortium, measured in terms of turnover and job creation.
Clearly describe the expected impact in both qualitative and quantitative terms, with factors such as time sensitivity and international competitiveness considered in the light of the technology field, innovation area and industry sectors concerned.
The time to initial market take-up should be no more than 3 years from the start of your FTI action.
In very well-justified cases linked to the specific characteristics of a particular innovation field or industry sector, the time to initial market take-up could be longer.
Possible impacts on sustainability or climate change, in particular, or on other cross-cutting objectives of Horizon 2020, must be highlighted.
Participation from industry in your consortium is mandatory. Universities and research and technology organisations can also participate. Actors with an important role in commercialisation are encouraged to take part, such as cluster organisations, end-users, industry associations, incubators, investors, and the public sector. Including start-ups with ground-breaking ideas that could create new markets is encouraged.

Scope:
Principles and funding of the EIC Accelerator pilot (SME Instrument)
Who can apply?
For-profit SMEs, including young companies and start-ups, from any sector. You must be established in an EU Member State or a Horizon 2020 associated country.
Following the cut-off date of 5 June 2019, only individual[1] for-profit SMEs established in an EU Members State or a Horizon 2020 associated country.
What topics are covered?
There are no set topics. Negative impacts on climate and the environment shall be avoided.
How does it work?
The EIC Accelerator pilot (SME Instrument) provides full-cycle business innovation support. In Phase 2 support is provided in the form of grant only or, following the cut-off date of 5 June 2019, blended finance (combining grant and equity). The EIC Accelerator pilot (SME Instrument) also includes coaching and mentoring.
Feasibility study: Phase 1
Phase 1 helps you get a grip on the R&D, technical feasibility and commercial potential of a ground-breaking, innovative idea and develop it into a credible business plan.
Activities can include, for example, risk assessment, market research, user involvement, analysis of regulatory constraints or standards regimes, intellectual property management, partner search, or feasibility assessment.
Your goal in Phase 1 is to formulate a solid, high-potential innovation project with a European or global growth-oriented strategy
Your proposal must be based on an initial business plan and outline the specifications of a more elaborate one, which will be the outcome of the project.
Phase 1 funding is a lump sum of €50 000[2]. Projects should last around 6 months.
Please note Phase 1 will be discontinued[3]. The final deadline for applications will be 5 September 2019.
From concept to market: Phase 2
Phase 2 helps you develop your business concept further into a market-ready product, service or process aligned with your company's growth strategy. Activities could, for example, include product/service development, trials, prototyping, validation, demonstration and testing in real-world conditions, and market replication. If the activity concerns a primarily technological innovation, a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5/6 or above is required for primarily technological innovation or the equivalent for non-technological innovation. You can subcontract work essential for your innovation project.
Phase 2 offers a grant only support to SMEs in need of one last push before the scaling-up phase; and it will offer blended finance (combining grant and equity)[4] to SMEs looking to further develop, grow and scale-up their idea.
Beneficiaries of the EIC Accelerator pilot (SME instrument) have access to Business Acceleration Services as described below.
You can apply to Phase 1 as a means of preparing for Phase 2, or you can apply directly to Phase 2.
Your proposal must be based on a strategic business plan that was either developed in Phase 1 or by another means. Your proposal must specify the expected outcome of the project and criteria for success, as well as the expected impacts on your company in both qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market size, IP management, sales, return on investment, profitability, and particularly the level of risk/ de-risking factor associated with support under the EIC Accelerator pilot).
You must pay particular attention to IP protection and ownership, and present convincing evidence or measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation (often known as 'freedom to operate'). You should also address regulatory and standardisation issues.
Grant only funding is provided (funding rate 70%) of between €0.5 million and €2.5 million.
Under the blended finance option, the grant component is limited to €2.5 million combined with an equity component of up to €15 million.[5] You can request a higher or lower amount, duly justified, when applying.
Proposals with activities up to TRL 8 will be funded by grants or a blended finance option. Close to market activities (i.e. TRL 9 or above) included in a proposal, will only be financed by equity participation as long as the proposal remains non-bankable.
The grant dimension of your project should normally take 12 to 24 months to complete, but could be longer in exceptional and well-justified cases.
Business Acceleration Services
The Business Acceleration Services (SME Instrument Phase 3) help you take advantage of additional EU support extended via a range of business support services offered on the EIC Community Platform, open to researchers and innovators benefiting from the different EIC calls for proposals.[6] This support can take the form of coaching, training, links to investors, public and private procurers of innovation, partnering and networking with other EIC beneficiaries. The Business Acceleration Services provide specific support to EIC clients that are SMEs, mainly to help them access new markets through participation to overseas trade fairs or customers and link with investors. It does not provide direct funding. In line with Commission’s communication for the ‘European Green Deal’[7], the Business Acceleration Services will in particular support EIC funded SMEs in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.
All Business Acceleration Services are accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which serves as an information portal and networking space. [See 'EIC Support Actions']
If you are benefiting from funding from the EIC Pathfinder pilot, the EIC Accelerator pilot or FTI, you will receive business coaching to help your business scale up and grow. Up to 12 coaching days are available.[8]
Coaching covers business development, organisational development, cooperation, and financing.
Up to 3 coaching-days, per funded project, are available in Phase 1 of the EIC Accelerator pilot. Under the EIC Pathfinder pilot, the Accelerator or FTI up to 12 coaching-days, per funded project, are available.
The impact driven coaching service, supported by the European Commission, is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN). Coaching is delivered by one or more qualified, experienced business coaches recruited from a database managed by the European Commission. All coaches meet stringent criteria regarding business experience and coaching skills. Throughout your project, the EEN will complement the coaching support. EEN offers a service package covering an assessment of your firm's innovation management capacities and the identification of a suitable coach or consulting package to address the gaps, EEN also provides access to its innovation and internationalisation services.
If you are benefiting from funding from the EIC Pathfinder pilot, the EIC Accelerator pilot or FTI, we will offer mentoring to individual founders, CEOs and leaders.
Mentoring aims to develop leadership skills such as resilience, tenacity and strategic insight.
The mentoring scheme will involve one-to-one meetings with an experienced entrepreneur, who will share expertise and provide impartial guidance and support.
Mentors will be CEOs of firms that have moved beyond the start-up stage. To begin with, mentors will be drawn from a pool of SME Instrument Phase 2 current and former clients willing to act as mentors on a pro bono basis.
Mentors and mentees will be matched up via the EIC Community Platform and during EIC Events and other suitable events.

","Coordination and support action
","09 June 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Start-ups and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are the primary source of innovation in Europe and globally. However, the fragmentation of innovation ecosystems and the lack of connectedness among public national and regional agencies appear to be one of the main bottlenecks towards ensuring the support of the most promising start-up and scale-up companies in the EU.
The start-ups and the SMEs very often lack tools and resources (human and financial) that will enable them to promote the deployment and uptake of innovative solutions, and thus grow and compete at global level. Moreover, they are at a disadvantage to recruit external experts to help them in their innovation and business development, including at transnational level to exploit the potential of the Single Market and global trade opportunities. Both are essential for start-ups and SMEs to ensure product/market fit, successful launch and later scaling of their innovations.
A key stage of this process is to elaborate a feasibility study of their innovative products/services, which would clearly demonstrate the ways forward and concrete steps to follow. The feasibility study (proof-of-concept) explore the scientific or technical feasibility and commercial potential of a new idea in order to develop an innovation project. A number of national/regional innovation agencies have schemes that tackle this specific key stage and need or consider setting one. However, up to now national and regional innovation agencies operate rather in isolation across EU in relation to the implementation of their programmes.
The topic focuses on start-ups and highly innovative SMEs with international ambitions, determined to turn strong, innovative business ideas into winners on the market, from the stage of business idea conception and planning. In order to select and support effectively those most promising innovators with strong potential on European and world markets, national and/or regional agencies across Europe would strongly benefit from the actions under this topic for transnational mutual learning and common tools and resources.
Scope:
This aims to enhance cooperation among innovation agencies of the European innovation ecosystem by establishing a mutual learning process at national and regional level, as well as by developing joint tools and resources to assist start-ups and SMEs to innovate.
The pilot action will create an enhancing, supporting and cooperative environment across EU that will allow national and regional agencies to:
cooperate, learn from each other and exchange knowledge by using join tools in order to provide high-level services and support high-quality start-ups and SMEs for their innovation projects;
create and operate national and/or regional support schemes regarding feasibility studies and external expertise, thus ensuring that the most promising high-potential innovation proposals of start-ups / SMEs are supported at their critical stage of development.
In particular, the cooperation that will notably involve the participation of national or regional innovation agencies or similar organisations should focus on:
Exchange of information and best practices, with focus on:
Best ways to better identify the specific needs of the start-ups and SMEs in order to allow the customization of the provided services
The design of programmes at national/regional levels with the view of filling possible gaps in relation to the services provided by the European Innovation Council (EIC), as well as the design of the project proposals and the weight of the criteria
Internationalisation of evaluation panels. The cooperation shall also enable accesses to respective pools of evaluators in order to set international evaluation panels and facilitate the establishment of minimum set of common evaluation criteria.
Coaching services and selection of coaches, including access to existing databases of coaches/experts (EU, national, regional) and possible creation of pools of experts. Optionally, design and development of other common tools and resources.
Identifying ways to continue the exchanges, provided services, tools and resources after the end of the action.
The established national and/or regional support schemes could include the following:
Common tools and resources to support, with the respective budgets of the national innovation agencies, highly innovative start-ups and SMEs with a clear commercial ambition and a potential for high growth and internationalisation for their close-to-market activities. The national resources deployed by national innovation agencies, if relevant, will need to comply with State Aid competition rules
Feasibility study as an outcome of the project (not necessarily the only one)
International pool of evaluators of the projects
Short market-oriented project proposal template/form
Introduction of other supportive services, including coaching services to the beneficiaries
Follow up of the beneficiaries and advice services concerning other possible instruments on national/regional/EU levels, as well as other ways of private funding for the continuation of a project, in case the feasibility studies demonstrate that it is worth proceeding to the next phase of development.
Expected Impact:
This will enhance the quality of support provided at national and regional levels to the most promising innovative start-ups and SMEs, by enabling:
exchange of information and best practice and closer dialogue between the innovation agencies involved

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In order to create a world-class pan-European High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure and to provide state-of-the-art services with access by users, independently of their location, the HPC resources need to be further pooled, integrated and rationalised. Horizon 2020 is a key element to support the European strategy on High Performance Computing which sets the way forward, in particular regarding the access to the best supercomputing facilities and services for both industry and academia. This topic is synergetic to the activities of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in HPC in order to fully implement the European HPC strategy.
Scope:
Proposals will address all points below:
(1) Provide a seamless and efficient Europe-wide Tier-0[1] service to users, based on promoting research excellence and innovation; this includes peer-review procedures for the allocation of computing time; transparent billing; and specific services adapted to the needs of users, including ESFRI projects, Horizon 2020 projects/programmes, large institutional users or industry.
(2) Carry out activities (training, service prototyping, software development etc.) that build on national HPC capabilities (Tier-1) and are necessary to support Tier-0 services or a functional European HPC ecosystem;
(3) Ensure openness to new user communities and new applications; promote industrial take-up of HPC services in particular by SMEs;
(4) Implement inclusive and equitable governance and a flexible business model to ensure long term financial sustainability; the business model should allow financial or in-kind contributions by research projects/programmes, institutions, industry and regions or countries; based on an auditable cost model for the operation of HPC Centres providing European services with different financing sources;
(5) Develop and maintain the strategy for the deployment of a rich HPC environment of world-class systems with different machine architectures - evolving towards exascale - including the implementation roadmap at EU and national level, taking into account financial aspects, best practices for reduction of operating and energy costs, and the specifications and technical requirements for a varied set of Tier-0 systems ensuring a broad coverage of user needs;
(6) Working in synergy with the European Technology Platform for HPC (ETP4HPC) and the Centres of Excellence in HPC applications in support of the European HPC strategy towards the next generation of computing systems, technologies and applications. In particular, the mechanisms to be put in place by PRACE for the provision of technical specifications to guide research activities for future exascale prototypes and systems, for the testing and demonstration of such exascale solutions, for the identification of new user needs in the use of next generation computing systems evolving towards exascale, and for the reaching out to scientific and industrial communities and the transfer of know-how for the use of HPC.
(7) Design and execute training and skills development programmes tailored to the needs of research in academia and industry and relevant public services in order to stay at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs, as well as introduction of scientific computing and HPC in academic curricula;
(8) Develop an international cooperation policy and associated activities in the area of HPC aiming at systems interoperation.
The PRACE infrastructure should provide core and basic services in coordination with other e-infrastructure providers to promote interoperability and a seamless user experience. Interworking with other computing infrastructures such as clouds and grids should be ensured.
Expected Impact:
The successful response to this area will improve services and procedures for user access to HPC infrastructure resources and services. Allocation schemes fostering openness to new user communities and applications will increased the amount of computing cycles available to researchers at European level through user-friendly and efficient procedures. This will help Europe staying at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs and innovation. This initiative will increase the number of industrial organisations (in particular SMEs), EU projects and institutional users benefiting from access to services including training in HPC. Benefits will also translate in increased investment in HPC infrastructure in Europe (national, regional and EU), long term financial sustainability through flexible business models and inclusive governance, better coordination between demand and supply in the European HPC ecosystem, with improved collaboration of the users and procurers with technology developers and suppliers to foster innovation.
Cross-cutting Priorities:

","Research and Innovation action
","08 December 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This topic covers two complementary areas of e-infrastructures very closely related with the objective to make research data discoverable, accessible, assessable, intelligible, useable, and wherever possible interoperable – c.f. G8 principles on research data:
(a) Secure and agile data and distributed computing e-infrastructures: fostering the integration of a secure, permanent, on-demand service-driven, privacy-compliant and sustainable e-infrastructure incorporating distributed databases, computing resources and software.
The European data and computing e-infrastructure landscape remains very fragmented which is an obstacle for research collaboration at European and global levels and introduces additional complexity for achieving sustainable governance. The challenge is to integrate at European level the geographically and disciplinary dispersed resources to achieve economies of scale and efficiency gains in providing the best data and computing capacity and services to the research and education communities. This action is interrelated to INFRADEV-04-2016, “European Open Science Cloud for Research”.
(b) Access and preservation platforms for scientific information: supporting the integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure for reliable and permanent open access to digital scientific records, based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic repositories, aggregators, etc.).
The European infrastructures need to respond to the emerging requirements for seamless and reliable access to publications, research data and software. These requirements are complemented by the need for long term preservation and curation of scientific information to fully support data and computing intensive science. The challenge is to support the integration at European level of a robust and sustainable e-infrastructure, based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic publishing platforms, aggregators, etc.) and services supporting European Open Access policies. An additional challenge is the building of capacity to link all kinds of digital research objects in order to enable a more transparent evaluation of research and reproducibility of results, enabling trust and facilitating access by innovative business actors.
Scope:
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary between them. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. The main purpose of the collaboration agreements referred to in Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement is to work on potential synergies, overlaps and gaps in the overall service offering. In addition, links should also be established with projects selected under topic INFRADEV-04-2016, to collaborate, exploit potential synergies and ensure complementarity.
Proposals will address part (a) or (b), but not both. At least one proposal for each part will be selected:
(a) Secure and agile data and distributed computing e-infrastructures (proposals should address all points below):
(1) integration of computing, software and storage resources exposing them through a dynamic registry and catalogue of services supporting European research and education communities in their tasks related with data and computing intensive science. This integration should be done by means of open and flexible architectures and include institutional, regional, national and European capabilities, packaging them in the optics of end-user needs
(2) seamless operation of highly scalable and agile data and computing platforms and services dedicated to analytics including hardware and software components, database, compilers, analytics software, supported to easy user entry points for the community of users
(3) reliably address the aspects of privacy, cybersecurity and information assurance supporting multiple compartments with private, public or industrial corpus of data, protected from unauthorized access by secure interfaces
(4) adoption of standards-based common interfaces, open source components enabling access and processing of underlying data collected/stored in different platforms and formats. Empowering users to customise application and services tailoring them to specific requirements, which will differ across disciplines, applications etc
(5) work closely with user communities (from different disciplines) to foster the use of digital infrastructures, promote the values of open science and support their data management plans. Engage and train users (researchers, educators and students) to contribute to the dynamic registry and catalogue of services improving quality of data, software and computing infrastructure that become available for re-use
(6) foster interoperability of pan-European thematic/community-driven e-infrastructures providing cost-effective and interoperable solutions for data management. The data and computing e-infrastructure should be able to interoperate with resources based on different technologies which are operated/owned by public and or private organisations
(7) support the preservation and curation of data and associated software so that the reproducibility and accuracy of the data can be verified
(8) enable seamless transition and e-infrastructure upgrades, exploiting economies of scale and promoting interoperability with similar infrastructures across and beyond Europe and operate user-friendly and comprehensive repositories of software components for research and education
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(b) Access and preservation platforms for scientific information (proposals will address all points below):
(1) Deployment and maintenance of service-driven knowledge e-infrastructure responding to general and specific requirements of researchers and research organisations for open access to research digital objects, their registration and preservation. This e-infrastructure will further develop the research capacity through a coordinated and participatory architecture linking institutional and thematic repositories across Europe. It will support publishing platforms by providing essential services for scientific information that can be used by humans and machines. Such target platforms can be generic, specific for a research field or specialised on quality assurance, discoverability, archiving etc. Essential functions of this service-driven approach will include helpdesks, training and guidance to support producers and users of scientific information, community building to support research data sharing and management, as well as implementation of Open Access policies in Europe. Relevant indicators on the take-up of open access in Europe including publications and data should be elaborated and reported regularly. The project will promote a limited set of biblio- and webometrics that reflect open access policies. It will collect bibliometric data on publications, citations, data citations, etc. on all Horizon 2020 scientific output (including on the Open Research Data Pilot) and produce both standard and on-demand statistics.
(2) Supporting global interoperability of open access data e-infrastructures and linking with similar initiatives across the globe to complement the physical access to research facilities with data access and to ensure that Europe plays a leading role in international collaborations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that one proposal will be selected.
Expected Impact:
(a) the operation of a federated European data and distributed computing infrastructure for research and education communities will optimise the access to IT equipment and services and will put all European researchers and educators in equal footing to access essential resources to express their talent and creativity. Establishing partnerships with industrial and private partners the e-infrastructure will train people in research and academic organisations preventing lack of skilled and specialised infrastructure operators. It will avoid the locking-in to particular hardware or software platforms that would jeopardise the long-term planning for capacity upgrades. With such an operational infrastructure more scientific communities will use storage and computing infrastructures with state-of-the-art services for their research and education activities. The open nature of the infrastructure will allow scientists, educators and students to improve the service quality by interacting with data, software and computing resources. It will increase the incentives for scientific discovery and collaboration across disciplinary and geographical boundaries, putting Europe in the driving seat at global level. It will further develop the European economic innovation capacity and provide stability to the e-infrastructure.
(b) a reliable operation of e-infrastructure services for access and preservation of scientific information will make the intellectual capital of Europe available to researchers, business and citizens at large. It will generate economic and scientific advances now and in the future as that capital is safely preserved for further exploitation by future generations. Open Access publications resulting from Horizon 2020 funded research are available and easily findable online. Data needed to validate published results is linked to the publications and publicly shared whenever possible. Accurate science metrics for Horizon 2020 can be produced with almost no effort. Most of the European institutional repositories (at least 95%) as well as the principal thematic repositories are part of the same interoperable repository network.

Scope:
Principles and funding of the EIC Accelerator pilot (SME Instrument)
Who can apply?
For-profit SMEs, including young companies and start-ups, from any sector. You must be established in an EU Member State or a Horizon 2020 associated country.
Following the cut-off date of 5 June 2019, only individual[1] for-profit SMEs established in an EU Members State or a Horizon 2020 associated country.
What topics are covered?
There are no set topics. Negative impacts on climate and the environment shall be avoided.
How does it work?
The EIC Accelerator pilot (SME Instrument) provides full-cycle business innovation support. In Phase 2 support is provided in the form of grant only or, following the cut-off date of 5 June 2019, blended finance (combining grant and equity). The EIC Accelerator pilot (SME Instrument) also includes coaching and mentoring.
Feasibility study: Phase 1
Phase 1 helps you get a grip on the R&D, technical feasibility and commercial potential of a ground-breaking, innovative idea and develop it into a credible business plan.
Activities can include, for example, risk assessment, market research, user involvement, analysis of regulatory constraints or standards regimes, intellectual property management, partner search, or feasibility assessment.
Your goal in Phase 1 is to formulate a solid, high-potential innovation project with a European or global growth-oriented strategy
Your proposal must be based on an initial business plan and outline the specifications of a more elaborate one, which will be the outcome of the project.
Phase 1 funding is a lump sum of €50 000[2]. Projects should last around 6 months.
Please note Phase 1 will be discontinued[3]. The final deadline for applications will be 5 September 2019.
From concept to market: Phase 2
Phase 2 helps you develop your business concept further into a market-ready product, service or process aligned with your company's growth strategy. Activities could, for example, include product/service development, trials, prototyping, validation, demonstration and testing in real-world conditions, and market replication. If the activity concerns a primarily technological innovation, a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5/6 or above is required for primarily technological innovation or the equivalent for non-technological innovation. You can subcontract work essential for your innovation project.
Phase 2 offers a grant only support to SMEs in need of one last push before the scaling-up phase; and it will offer blended finance (combining grant and equity)[4] to SMEs looking to further develop, grow and scale-up their idea.
Beneficiaries of the EIC Accelerator pilot (SME instrument) have access to Business Acceleration Services as described below.
You can apply to Phase 1 as a means of preparing for Phase 2, or you can apply directly to Phase 2.
Your proposal must be based on a strategic business plan that was either developed in Phase 1 or by another means. Your proposal must specify the expected outcome of the project and criteria for success, as well as the expected impacts on your company in both qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market size, IP management, sales, return on investment, profitability, and particularly the level of risk/ de-risking factor associated with support under the EIC Accelerator pilot).
You must pay particular attention to IP protection and ownership, and present convincing evidence or measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation (often known as 'freedom to operate'). You should also address regulatory and standardisation issues.
Grant only funding is provided (funding rate 70%) of between €0.5 million and €2.5 million.
Under the blended finance option, the grant component is limited to €2.5 million combined with an equity component of up to €15 million.[5] You can request a higher or lower amount, duly justified, when applying.
Proposals with activities up to TRL 8 will be funded by grants or a blended finance option. Close to market activities (i.e. TRL 9 or above) included in a proposal, will only be financed by equity participation as long as the proposal remains non-bankable.
The grant dimension of your project should normally take 12 to 24 months to complete, but could be longer in exceptional and well-justified cases.
Business Acceleration Services
The Business Acceleration Services (SME Instrument Phase 3) help you take advantage of additional EU support extended via a range of business support services offered on the EIC Community Platform, open to researchers and innovators benefiting from the different EIC calls for proposals.[6] This support can take the form of coaching, training, links to investors, public and private procurers of innovation, partnering and networking with other EIC beneficiaries. The Business Acceleration Services provide specific support to EIC clients that are SMEs, mainly to help them access new markets through participation to overseas trade fairs or customers and link with investors. It does not provide direct funding. In line with Commission’s communication for the ‘European Green Deal’[7], the Business Acceleration Services will in particular support EIC funded SMEs in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.
All Business Acceleration Services are accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which serves as an information portal and networking space. [See 'EIC Support Actions']
If you are benefiting from funding from the EIC Pathfinder pilot, the EIC Accelerator pilot or FTI, you will receive business coaching to help your business scale up and grow. Up to 12 coaching days are available.[8]
Coaching covers business development, organisational development, cooperation, and financing.
Up to 3 coaching-days, per funded project, are available in Phase 1 of the EIC Accelerator pilot. Under the EIC Pathfinder pilot, the Accelerator or FTI up to 12 coaching-days, per funded project, are available.
The impact driven coaching service, supported by the European Commission, is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN). Coaching is delivered by one or more qualified, experienced business coaches recruited from a database managed by the European Commission. All coaches meet stringent criteria regarding business experience and coaching skills. Throughout your project, the EEN will complement the coaching support. EEN offers a service package covering an assessment of your firm's innovation management capacities and the identification of a suitable coach or consulting package to address the gaps, EEN also provides access to its innovation and internationalisation services.
If you are benefiting from funding from the EIC Pathfinder pilot, the EIC Accelerator pilot or FTI, we will offer mentoring to individual founders, CEOs and leaders.
Mentoring aims to develop leadership skills such as resilience, tenacity and strategic insight.
The mentoring scheme will involve one-to-one meetings with an experienced entrepreneur, who will share expertise and provide impartial guidance and support.
Mentors will be CEOs of firms that have moved beyond the start-up stage. To begin with, mentors will be drawn from a pool of SME Instrument Phase 2 current and former clients willing to act as mentors on a pro bono basis.
Mentors and mentees will be matched up via the EIC Community Platform and during EIC Events and other suitable events.

In order to ensure the EU added value of supported activities, the development of solutions has to be tailored to the specific problems or needs of one or more sea basins or sub-sea basin surrounding the EU coasts (e.g. Mediterranean, Western-Mediterranean, Adriatic-Ionian Seas, Atlantic, North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea).
The proposals submitted under this topic must develop the following specific elements:
solid partnerships between maritime stakeholders and fostering multidisciplinary approaches and combination of competences from businesses, the public sector and research bodies;
enhanced cooperation and coordination amongst maritime stakeholders at local, regional or even sea basin levels.
*Blue Lab definition:
For the purpose of this call, a ""Blue Lab"" is the collective endeavour to develop a new idea and to apply it in the maritime domain and/or marine environment. It provides the organizational space for collaborative and multidisciplinary work. A Blue Lab shall be:
- Result-oriented: resulting in a tangible deliverable, such as a pre-marketable service, product or prototype;
- Multidisciplinary: developed by involving businesses, researchers, young scientists (e.g. post-graduate students, recent post-graduates, other students) and, if relevant, other entities such as local authorities, NGOs etc.; and bringing different disciplines together into a common project idea development.
- Stakeholder driven: being designed and implemented in cooperation with at least one private partner and in consultation with a group of relevant partners (e.g. research bodies, businesses and local authorities).
Scope:
For this topic, we seek to fund projects that will develop innovative solutions relating to one of the following themes. Applicants must select only one of the following specific themes per proposal:
1. Blue bio-remediation: e.g. exploiting metabolites, biomolecules, enzymes and genes from micro-organisms living in extreme marine environments in order to develop new technologies, products or services which can solve problems such as pollution, disposal of hazardous materials, etc.;
2. Unexploded ordnances at sea: e.g. development of innovative solutions and tools (algorithm, artificial intelligence systems, methods and standards) to identify and recognize different types of unexploded ordnances, to detect their deterioration (e.g. corrosion state, release of toxins, movement) and their impact on the environment, to disarm, safely remove and demolish ammunition from the sea, including to sense and neutralise chemical agents.
3. Innovative marina and leisure boat design: e.g. development of technological solutions/products and services for marinas to adapt to changing demand from customers (e.g. access to marinas and boats for an ageing population; ICT-oriented requirements from young people) and/or address environmental challenges (e.g. safe dismantling and recycling of leisure boats);
4. Marine biomass and blue-bioeconomy: e.g. development of new technological solutions/products and approaches to add value to otherwise low value marine biomass, including jellyfish, algae, mollusc shells, and fish (also fish products for non-direct human consumption);
5. Ecofriendly aquaculture[1] : e.g. establishment of new markets, product support, and adaptation of existing production towards the most eco-friendly and sustainable practices such as multi-species, multi-product production (e.g. Integrated MultiTrophic Aquaculture and aquaponics).
EASME intends to fund at least one project for each of the above themes.
As part of the evaluation process, priority will be given to proposals that build on the outcome of prior research or applied research projects, whether EU-funded or supported from other sources. In this context, proposals shall describe how they build on, complement and differ from finalised or ongoing research and innovation projects, including from EU programmes, if relevant. Where a proposal will operate in a particular sea basin in which a sea basin strategy or similar initiative exists[2], priority will be given to proposals that explain how they contribute to the objectives of the relevant sea basin strategy or initiative.
Expected Impact:
Applicants have to list the main results[3] expected from the project. The expected results to be achieved by the end of the project must be concrete, realistic and quantified as far as possible.
Proposals must clearly describe the specific results of the project for each of the following elements:
New services/products/tools relating to selected marine/maritime challenges/opportunities developed at pilot or pre-commercial stage;
Partnerships combining multidisciplinary competences from businesses, the public sector and research bodies, and integrating local knowledge, resulting in an increased capacity to drive innovation forward;

As outlined in the policy background in section 1, recent reports[1][2] underlined the existence of considerable funding gaps in scaling up projects from pilot to demonstration projects and moving from demonstration to flagship/first-of-a-kind and industrial-scale projects in different blue growth sectors. In this context, this topic aims to support demonstration projects based on innovative technologies testing/deploying/scaling-up of new industrial or service applications and solutions for the blue economy[3].
Such support is important to:
Help innovative technologies and/or maritime services improve their market readiness and advance towards market entry, allowing economic players, in particular SMEs, to apply new ideas and research results in marketable goods and services;
Facilitate scaling up business models and service concepts;
De-risk the deployment of these demonstration projects and provide the necessary credibility for these projects to enable them to access other financing for the development of their activities.
Going beyond research/applied research, applicants must explain how their proposals will help innovative technologies and/or maritime services improve their market-readiness and advance towards the commercial phase demonstrating the benefit of a new product, service, process, and system to potential clients in a real environment.
In this respect, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed actions must be between 6 (“technology demonstrated in relevant environment”) and 9 (“actual system proven in operational environment”)[4], as defined in Commission Decision C(2014)4995[5].
Likewise, proposals must have a completed proof of concept and early field trials under way.
Scope:
In order to achieve the objectives above, proposals must:
tackle innovation that goes beyond research and aims at helping innovative maritime technologies and/or maritime services close to market-readiness to advance towards the commercial phase;
contribute to at least one of the EU priority areas of the Circular Economy[6], the (Blue) Bioeconomy[7], as well as the Energy union and climate[8];
demonstrate a clear link/application of enabling technologies such as imaging and physical sensors, satellite technologies, advanced materials, ICT, big data analytics, autonomous systems, biotechnology, nanotechnology, subsea engineering and/or are based on transferring technology from outside the maritime industry.
To promote the involvement of third-party investment, in particular by private financing bodies or National Promotional Banks[9] (NPBs), priority will be given to proposals that are at a sufficiently advanced stage in terms of securing funding from third party investors, e.g. as demonstrated by, for instance, a letter of intent by an investor to support the project.
As part of the evaluation process, priority will be given to proposals that build on the outcome of prior research or applied research projects, whether EU-funded or supported from other sources. In this context, proposals shall describe how they build on, complement and differ from finalised or ongoing research and innovation projects, including from EU programmes, if relevant. Where a proposal will operate in a particular sea basin in which a sea basin strategy or similar initiative exists[10], priority will be given to proposals that explain how they contribute to the objectives of the relevant sea basin strategy or initiative.
Applications submitted by a consortium are eligible (see eligibility criteria in section 5) but the partners of the consortium need to be an essential part of the demonstration activity and expected results (see award criteria in section 6). Partners could potentially be clusters, research organisations, innovation agencies, first clients, etc. providing services within the project that the main beneficiary, the company, cannot easily provide themselves or that are not easily subcontracted.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This topic promotes innovative approaches to strengthen the cooperation between industry and education in order to bridge the gap between skills' offer and demand.
The applicant's choice of sector and action has to be based on an analysis of the needs of the labour market and of the industry, including at cross-border level. In order to ensure that supported activities take due account of clearly identified needs, projects should bring together stakeholders from both the industry, education and training providers (both at higher and vocational level).
Furthermore, projects should enhance the visibility and attractiveness of the different career opportunities in the blue economy, especially for young people.
In the context of the above general objectives, proposals submitted under this topic must provide concrete and effective responses to at least one of the following challenges:
Lack of entrepreneurial skills, including social entrepreneurial skills of graduates at both higher education and vocational education and training (VET) levels. Students need to be better equipped with advanced technical[1] as well as soft skills[2] enabling them to develop new ideas and products, and possibly launch their own start-up. Lack of profiles with strong adaptation capacity, able to update their skills to future needs that are still unknown;
Lack of structured, defined and continued collaboration between industry and education/training in order to ensure that curricula and training programmes are actually meeting industry needs; lack of industry involvement and leading companies to re-train internally the graduates; difficulties in attracting a sufficient number of competent lecturers with work experience in the maritime industry; difficulties in keeping employees as full-time workers in the companies;
Lack of “skills ecosystems” at sea basin level between education, industry and public authorities (knowledge triangle), to support trans-regional innovation strategies.
Scope:
For this topic, we seek to fund projects that will develop innovative solutions relating to at least one of the following themes. Projects may cover more than one of these themes:
Introducing innovative teaching and training methodologies to boost entrepreneurial skills and equip graduates with suitable soft skills to develop their own ideas, products and start-ups. Links with incubators, innovation hubs, social enterprises and early-stage investors are encouraged. Industry should be involved from the start of the project by shaping together the actions, putting forward a social or technological challenge and following it up with the most successful students;
Promoting structured and permanent collaboration frameworks between industry and education, whereby the most recent technological and market developments are directly integrated into the educational offer, enabling to reply to labour market needs. Training should be more practice-oriented and flexible. Qualitative apprenticeships should be promoted, combining substantial work based learning in companies and other workplaces with learning based in education or training institutions[3]. Professionals from industry should be constantly present during the educational path of students and more synergies between teachers and professionals from industry should be foreseen (for example through hybrid teaching[4]);
Creating education-industry-public authorities networks at sea basin level to map existing educational activities, enable pooling and sharing of best practices as well as of human and physical capital (e.g. training simulators,), develop common training programmes, and foster transnational mobility of learners and teachers. These networks could be set up within already established ones.
Expected Impact:
Applicants have to list the main results[5] expected from the project. The expected results to be achieved by the end of the project must be concrete, realistic and quantified as far as possible.
Proposals must clearly describe the specific results of the project from the list below, according to the theme(s) pursued:
New synergies and structured cooperation between education and training institutions on the one hand and maritime industry on the other;
Improved employability of students thanks to acquisition of entrepreneurial and soft skills, and to better mentoring and career guidance schemes;
Development of new ideas from students that could be further developed within incubators or companies;
New and accessible pathways facilitating career advancement and job mobility within the blue economy;
New and highly visible training opportunities (including career guidance) allowing professionals to acquire the right skills to find a job in the blue economy;
Better pooling and sharing of resources between different educational institutes and companies and national and trans-national level;
Increased awareness of ocean issues and increased visibility and attractiveness of blue career opportunities for students from secondary and higher education in general.

Combat violence and tackle racism, discrimination and intolerance in sport;
Encourage social inclusion and equal opportunities in sport.
In all these areas, gender equality should be promoted. Cooperation with the Partner Countries should be encouraged. Collaborative Partnerships should promote the creation and development of European networks in the field of sport. The EU can thereby provide opportunities for strengthened cooperation among stakeholders, which would not have existed without EU action. Collaborative Partnerships should also foster synergy with, and between, local, regional, national and international policies to promote sport and physical activity and to address sport-related challenges.
Within the framework of Collaborative Partnerships, Erasmus+ intends to support the testing and development of new project formats and new forms of transnational cooperation in the field of sport that are likely to inspire the development, on a larger scale of initiatives supported with national funding schemes or other European funds, such as the European Structural and Investment Funds.
The Commission, through its Executive Agency, will carry one selection round over the year.
Erasmus+ offers a large flexibility in terms of activities that Collaborative Partnerships can implement, as long as a proposal demonstrates that these activities are the most appropriate to reach the objectives defined for the project. Collaborative Partnerships may typically cover a broad range of activities, such as for example:
networking among stakeholders; 
development, identification, promotion and sharing of good practices; 
preparation, development and implementation of educational and training modules and tools; 
activities to increase the competences of multipliers in the field of sport and to develop monitoring and benchmarking of indicators, notably as regards the promotion of ethical behaviours and codes of conduct among sportspeople; 
awareness-raising activities on the added value of sport and physical activity in relation to the personal, social and professional development of individuals; 
activities to promote innovative synergies between the field of sport and the fields of health, education, training and youth; 
activities to improve the evidence-base of sport to tackle societal and economic challenges (collection of data underpinning the aforementioned activities, surveys, consultations, etc.); 
conferences, seminars, meetings, events and awareness-raising actions underpinning the aforementioned activities."

Objectives
ERC Synergy Grants are intended to enable minimum two to maximum four Principal Investigators and their teams to bring together complementary skills, knowledge, and resources in new ways, in order to jointly address ambitious research problems.
The aim is to promote substantial advances at the frontiers of knowledge, to cross-fertilize scientific fields, and to encourage new productive lines of enquiry and new methods and techniques, including unconventional approaches and investigations at the interface between established disciplines. This should enable transformative research not only at the forefront of European science but also to become a benchmark on a global scale.
Applicants Principal Investigators must demonstrate the synergies, complementarities and added value that could lead to breakthroughs that would not be possible by the individual Principal Investigators working alone.
Size of ERC Synergy Grants
Synergy Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 for a period of 6 years. The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration. This does not apply to ongoing projects.
However, up to an additional EUR 4 000 000 in total can be requested in the proposal to cover (a) eligible ""start-up"" costs for Principal Investigators moving to the EU or an Associated Country from elsewhere as a consequence of receiving the ERC grant and/or (b) the purchase of major equipment and/or (c) access to large facilities. As any additional funding is to cover major one-off costs it is not subject to pro-rata temporis reduction for projects of shorter duration. All funding requested is assessed during evaluation.
Profile of the ERC Synergy Grant Principal Investigators
Groups applying for the ERC Synergy Grant must be made up of a minimum of two and a maximum of four Principal Investigators and, as necessary, their teams. One of the Principal Investigators must be designated as the Corresponding Principal Investigator.
Applications are expected from a group of innovative and active Principal Investigators and must present an early achievement track-record or a 10-year track-record whichever is most appropriate for their career stage (see Starting, Consolidator and Advanced Grant profiles in the ERC Work Programme 2018). There is little prospect of an application succeeding in the absence of such a record."

","06 September 2017

Objectives
Frontier research often generates unexpected or new opportunities for commercial or societal application. The ERC Proof of Concept Grants aim to maximise the value of the excellent research that the ERC funds, by funding further work (i.e. activities which were not scheduled to be funded by the original ERC frontier research grant) to verify the innovation potential of ideas arising from ERC funded projects. Proof of Concept Grants are therefore on offer only to Principal Investigators whose proposals draw substantially on their ERC funded research.
Ethical Principles
All proposals will be subject to ethics review as with proposals for the ERC's frontier research grants.
Maximum size of grant and grant assessment
The financial contribution will be up to a maximum of EUR 150 000 for a period of 18 months. The ERC expects that normally, proof of concept projects should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, projects will be signed for 18 months. Given this initial flexibility, extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.
The overall level of the funding offered will be assessed during the evaluation. The funding requested by the applicant will be judged against the needs of the proposed activity before award. The funding requested by the Principal Investigator must be fully justified by an estimation of the actual costs for the proposed activities.
The Union financial contribution will take the form of the reimbursement of up to 100% of the total eligible and approved direct costs and of flat-rate financing of indirect costs on the basis of 25% of the total eligible direct costs (excluding the direct costs for subcontracting and the costs of resources made available by third parties which are not used on the premises of the host institution.). The level of the awarded grant represents a maximum overall figure – the final amount to be paid must be justified on the basis of the costs actually incurred for the project.
The indicative budget for this call for 2018 is EUR 20 000 000 (approximately one-third of which will be for each of the three evaluation rounds following three specific cut-off dates - proposals submitted before each cut-off date will be evaluated with the proposals submitted before the same cut-off date).
Profile of the ERC Proof of Concept Grant Principal Investigator
All Principal Investigators in an ERC frontier research project, that is either on going or has ended (where the duration of the project fixed in the ERC Grant Agreement has ended) less than 12 months before 1 January 2018, are eligible to participate and apply for an ERC Proof of Concept Grant.

ERC Consolidator Grants are designed to support excellent Principal Investigators at the career stage at which they may still be consolidating their own independent research team or programme. Applicant Principal Investigators must demonstrate the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of their scientific proposal.
Size of ERC Consolidator Grants
Consolidator Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of EUR 2 000 000 for a period of 5 years (The maximum award is reduced pro rata temporis for projects of a shorter duration. This does not apply to ongoing projects).
However, up to an additional EUR 750 000 can be requested in the proposal to cover (a) eligible ""start-up"" costs for Principal Investigators moving to the EU or an Associated Country from elsewhere as a consequence of receiving the ERC grant and/or (b) the purchase of major equipment and/or (c) access to large facilities (As any additional funding is to cover major one-off costs it is not subject to pro-rata temporis reduction for projects of shorter duration. All funding requested is assessed during evaluation).
Profile of the ERC Consolidator Grant Principal Investigator
The Principal Investigator shall have been awarded their first PhD over 7 and up to 12 years prior to 1 January 2019. The effective elapsed time since the award of the first PhD can be reduced in certain properly documented circumstances (see ERC Work Programme 2019).
A competitive Consolidator Grant Principal Investigator must have already shown research independence and evidence of maturity, for example by having produced several important publications as main author or without the participation of their PhD supervisor.

Objectives
Frontier research often generates unexpected or new opportunities for commercial or societal application. The ERC Proof of Concept Grants aim to maximise the value of the excellent research that the ERC funds, by funding further work (i.e. activities which were not scheduled to be funded by the original ERC frontier research grant) to verify the innovation potential of ideas arising from ERC funded projects. Proof of Concept Grants are therefore on offer only to Principal Investigators whose proposals draw substantially on their ERC funded research.
 Maximum size of grant and grant assessment
The financial contribution will be up to a maximum of EUR 150 000 for a period of 18 months. The ERC expects that normally, proof of concept projects should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, projects will be signed for 18 months. Given this initial flexibility, extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.
The overall level of the funding offered will be assessed during the evaluation. The funding requested by the applicant will be judged against the needs of the proposed activity before award. The funding requested by the Principal Investigator must be fully justified by an estimation of the actual costs for the proposed activities.
The Union financial contribution will take the form of the reimbursement of up to 100% of the total eligible and approved direct costs and of flat-rate financing of indirect costs of a maximum of 25% of the total eligible direct costs. The level of the awarded grant represents a maximum overall figure – the final amount to be paid must be justified on the basis of the costs actually incurred for the project.

Proof of Concept Grants are therefore on offer only to Principal Investigators whose proposals draw substantially on their ERC funded research.
Ethical Principles
All proposals will be subject to ethics review as with proposals for the ERC's frontier research grants.
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible Principal Investigator
All Principal Investigators in an ERC frontier research project, that is either on going or has ended [1] less than 12 months before the opening date of this call, are eligible to participate and apply for an ERC Proof of Concept Grant.
A Principal Investigator whose proposal was rejected on the grounds of a breach of research integrity in the calls for proposals under Work Programmes 2014 or 2015 may not submit a proposal to the calls for proposals made under Work Programme 2016.
Eligible projects
All proposals must be complete and be submitted before the relevant call deadline. Incomplete proposals may be declared ineligible.
The content of the proposal must relate to the objectives and to the grant type set out in the call, as defined in this work programme. A proposal will only be deemed ineligible on grounds of ‘scope’ in clear-cut cases.
Where there is a doubt on the eligibility of a proposal, the peer review evaluation may proceed pending a decision following an eligibility review committee. If it becomes clear before, during or after the peer review evaluation phase, that one or more of the eligibility criteria has not been met, the proposal will be declared ineligible and not considered any further.
Applicants will need to demonstrate the relation between the idea to be taken to proof of concept and the ERC frontier research project (Starting, Consolidator, Advanced or Synergy) in question.
More than one Proof of Concept Grant may be awarded per ERC funded frontier research project but only one Proof of Concept project may be running at any one time for the same ERC frontier research project [2].
Eligible Host Institution
The host institution (Applicant Legal Entity [3]) must engage the Principal Investigator for at least the duration of the proof of concept project as defined in the grant agreement and must be established in a Member State or an Associated Country[4].
Please also refer to Annex 3 - Countries Associated to Horizon 2020 and Restrictions Applying to Some Legal Entities Established in Certain Third Countries.
Maximum size of grant and grant assessment
The financial contribution will be up to a maximum of EUR 150 000 for a period of 18 months. The ERC expects that normally, proof of concept projects should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, projects will be signed for 18 months. Given this initial flexibility, extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.
The overall level of the funding offered will be assessed during the evaluation. The funding requested by the applicant will be judged against the needs of the proposed activity before award. The funding requested by the Principal Investigator must be fully justified by an estimation of the actual costs for the proposed activities.
The Union financial contribution will take the form of the reimbursement of up to 100% of the total eligible and approved direct costs and of flat-rate financing of indirect costs on the basis of 25% of the total eligible direct costs [5]. The level of the awarded grant represents a maximum overall figure – the final amount to be paid must be justified on the basis of the costs actually incurred for the project.
The indicative budget for this call for 2016 is EUR 20 000 000 (approximately one-third of which will be for each of the three evaluation rounds following three specific deadlines - proposals submitted before each cut-off date will be evaluated with the proposals submitted before the same cut-off date).
[1]Where the duration of the project fixed in the ERC Grant Agreement has ended.
[2]This limit also applies to Synergy projects.
[3]Please see important information for Principal Investigators, Candidates, Tenderers and Grant Applicants on possible registration of legal entities in the Commission's Early Warning System (EWS) and Central Exclusion Database (CED) on final page.
[4]It may also be an International European Interest Organisation (such as CERN, EMBL, etc.), the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), or an entity created under EU law. Any type of legal entity, public or private, including universities, research organisations as well as undertakings can host the Principal Investigator and his/her team.
[5]Excluding the direct costs for subcontracting and the costs of resources made available by third parties which are not used on the premises of the host institution."

The ERC wishes to support an ambitious series of communication actions to promote and raise awareness of ERC-funded projects and results across Europe to as wide an audience as possible, including: scientists, students, media, policy-makers, the business community and the general public.
The actions will go beyond traditional scientific conferences and take a novel and creative approach with the following characteristics:
-         spreading new ideas in science;
-         reaching a very wide public of specialists and non-specialists and new audiences at both European and local levels;
-         holding frequent, regular events throughout the duration of the campaign;
-         being based on carefully selected ERC projects and grantees, from a range of countries and disciplines;
-         ensuring visibility across Europe, covering different countries and languages;
-         ensuring further dissemination and strong follow-up beyond events through audio-visual, web and social media activities.
 Actions may include:
-        events to showcase selected ERC-funded results in the form of short, powerful and engaging talks given by ERC grantees;
-        popular science activities linked to science festivals, centres and/or museums, which are successful platforms to popularize and disseminate science among non-specialists;
-        cooperation with existing networks of universities, learned societies and science academies to establish ERC online lectures involving ERC grantees.
Because of the scope and ambition of these actions, each of them will be implemented by an external organisation or by a consortium of organisations, that should ensure the necessary scientific and communications capacity.
The maximum duration of the project will be 48 months. Up to two proposals will be selected."

Cloud computing is now an established global paradigm for the delivery of IT services in all sectors of the digital economy. However, further enhancements are still required in critical aspects of cloud computing, including enhanced security and privacy; trustworthy clouds; resource pooling; data management and traceability; virtualization; and hybrid systems. Support towards intercontinental experimentation on cloud infrastructures and services are necessary as well, especially in the context of EU-Brazil cooperation.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
The focus of the joint research will be the development of innovative technologies for next generation cloud infrastructures and services able to cope with the challenges from different application domains in business and societal contexts. The technologies to be developed should aim at future standardization as well as take into account interoperability and data portability.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1.0 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately by two distinct projects. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The joint EU-Brazil research is intended to develop innovative cloud computing technologies leading to next generation solutions. The research collaboration will also facilitate and enhance policy coordination between the EU and Brazil in relevant areas. In particular, projects are expected to:
Facilitate the development of cloud-enabled, secure and trustworthy applications based on robust standardized technologies.
Develop technologies to manage hybrid resources in the cloud, as well as solutions for cloud-centered data management.
Submit joint contributions towards international standardization activities.
Cross-cutting Priorities:

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In order to make use of the rich potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in real-world scenarios, technologies and tools developed so far need to be demonstrated in controlled environments with the ultimate goal of validation. Given the specific nature of this Call, widely replicable pilots are targeted in view of solving specific societal challenges, in the context of EU-Brazil cooperation.
Given the considerable amount of work carried out on M2M/IoT and Cyber Physical Systems architectures (e.g. IoT-A), platforms (e.g. FIWARE, CRYSTAL, SOFIA) and standards (e.g. oneM2M) over the last few years, pilots are encouraged to exploit this previous work where applicable. The goal is to further demonstrate the generic applicability of these architectures, platforms and standards and to identify where standards are missing or should evolve, as well as relevant pre-normative activities.
Pilots aim at validating IoT approaches to specific socio-economic challenges in real-life settings. Pilots' objectives include user acceptability, technology assessment and optimisation, business model validation, approaches to sustainability and replicability. They should be implemented through close cooperation between users and suppliers with the active involvement of relevant stakeholders on the demand side.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
IoT finds applicability in a broad range of industry, business and public services scenarios. Specific focus will be on implementing pilots incorporating the whole value-chain, and involving all relevant stakeholders, in particular end-users. Where relevant, institutional involvement may be appropriate.
The joint call would support three pilots each addressing a distinct area among the following areas of interest for EU-Brazil collaboration:
Environmental monitoring
Environmental and carbon footprint –as well as energy and water consumption- can be drastically reduced by an optimised management both along and across value-chains.Sensors can be used to measure and monitor a series of distinct environmental variables. The data collected across different areas can in turn be used for data analytics and decision-making. A pilot combining a system approach to integrate a large number of sensors across a large set of variables will test the acceptability and scalability of the selected IoT platform and test how to optimise results and reduce costs, as well as validating standards and interoperability.
Utilities: smart water management
Smart water management can reduce leakages, optimise watering and irrigation and improve water consumption both in cities and for agricultural purposes.A pilot focusing on integrated solutions enabling real-time interconnection of heterogeneous sensors and actuators, geo-localisation and data fusion including data from meteorological forecast will test the acceptability and scalability of the selected IoT platform. High reliability and low maintenance costs are key parameters as well as the possibility to replicate the pilot in other locations.
Utilities: energy management at home and in buildings[1]
A group of IoT use cases in the area of the residential smart grid that involve the use of a home energy management system (HEMS) that would exploit automation and self-learning capabilities to monitor and steer local energy consumption (electricity and carbon fuels) and generation. This includes the better steering of HVAC units according to thermostats, weather forecasts, dynamic electricity pricing, and availability of (locally) generated renewable energy.
Smart assisted living and wellbeing
A group of IoT use cases which use intelligent devices (e.g. wearables, sensors, smartphones, and intelligent home appliances) to autonomously generate reports on an individual's physical activity, overall vital signs and well-being. It allows the use and sharing of generated data for personal use or report to specific services (e.g. doctors, nurses, dieticians and sport coaches) through connected devices. It also enables ""smart assisted living"": the remote follow-up of vulnerable people (children, elderly, hospital patients, etc.) and the automated notification of emergency services, family, etc. when necessary.
Smart manufacturing: customisation
A group of IoT use cases that enable the production of customised outputs. Such production systems combine the low unit costs of mass production processes with the flexibility of individual customisation. This includes:
Continuous Additive Manufacturing;
Flexible automation for robot manufacturing;
Robot systems for additive manufacturing;
Production of one-of-a-kind customer designs; and dynamic production systems and shop floors - mobile robot for efficient and flexible use in cleanrooms.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately by three distinct projects. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Three projects in three different areas are expected.
Expected Impact:
Pilots should empower citizens, both in the public and private spheres, and businesses, as well as improve the associated public services where appropriate. Pilots are not only expected to validate technologies and architectures for a specific set of use cases requirements, but also the related business models to guarantee the sustainability of the approach. Security and privacy aspects relating to access to and processing of collected information need to be properly taken into consideration.
Improved sharing of information, approaches and solutions, as well as expertise through:
pilots on both sides and across the Atlantic, involving end-users.
establishing common benchmarks;
contributing to standardisation and to open-source and open-data repositories
linking with ongoing work in the IoT Focus Area.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
5G is expected not only to boost the services already provided by 4G (LTE-Advanced-PRO), but also to enable several new services and applications in multiple environments, as identified notably by ITU (ITU-R M.2083 recommendation), NGMN, 3GPP SA group and 5G PPP. 5G standardisation started in 2016 and is expected to extend until 2020 for a full specification. Within this time frame, there is still significant work to carry out to make sure that the multiple technologies contemplated for 5G will meet the full range of service requirements. Early validation with the widest possible footprint of candidate technologies for 5G is hence needed to support global consensus based on ""derisked"" technologies.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
The focus of the joint research will be to test and validate technologies currently contemplated for early 5G standardisation, primarily at radio access level but with a clear use case focus. The main goal is to validate technologies supporting 5G KPIs that cannot be addressed by today's existing technologies. Considering the joint interest of Brazil and the EU to use 5G in support of digitisation of vertical business sectors (health care, automotive, smart factories, energy, smart cities, agribusiness, etc.), the work could address specific vertical use case scenarios, namely massive Machine-type Communications (mMTC)/Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLL). Or it could address coverage of low population density areas. For this latter case, validation of spectrum options is in scope.
The testing and validation of technologies supporting core 5G standards is expected to be carried out through prototypes and user experiments.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The 5G joint EU-Brazil research is intended to support the development of innovative technologies in the context of 5G radio access or core network, to provide solutions for demanding requirements of ""vertical"" sectors or for coverage of low density regions.
Other impacts include:
novel contributions on 5G standards in support of global industry consensus,
support and spin off contributions to the ITU/3G PP standardisation roadmaps, e.g. through submission of joint contributions in these fora by EU and Brazilian players,
validation of 5G use cases applicable to low density regions or mMTC/URLL scenarios.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: When improving the level of energy performance of buildings in operation, embodied energy in materials presents an increasingly high percentage of the energy spent in the whole life cycle of a building. The same applies for CO2. Therefore, the development of new sustainable construction materials with lower embodied energy and lower CO2 emissions is needed. New approaches in material science and production technologies will help to minimize the embodied energy of the main construction materials such as concrete, glass, gypsum, ceramics or steel, involved in the structure, envelope and other building components of energy efficient buildings. At the same time, components with improved insulation and air tightness properties (which are influenced by construction tolerances) are needed, aiming at the overall target of reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission during the whole life cycle. Higher insulation can be achieved by improving bulk or surface properties in combination with novel mortars, plasters and coatings.
Scope: Proposals should address the development of new materials and/or solutions for building envelope components with reduced embodied energy, lower CO2 emissions and improved insulation properties during operation. The new components may also contribute to improve indoor air quality, by limiting VOCs emissions and/or by advanced properties aiming to absorb and biodegrade indoor contaminants. The proposed solutions should go well beyond the state of the art and take into account the final performance properties of the new materials and of the respective building components.
The following factors should also be considered: enhanced durability for increased use duration, reduced maintenance and consequently reduced costs, respect of sustainability principles (the sustainability of each developed solution should be evaluated via life cycle assessment studies carried out according to the International Reference Life Cycle Data System - ILCD Handbook); application to both new build and renovation; lightweight construction and ease of installation; realistic solutions at a reasonable price; increased comfort and noise reduction. Recycling/reuse of materials may also be addressed. Standardisation aspects can be considered particularly in relation with the work carried out in CEN/TC 350.
Proof of concept in terms of one (or more) component(s) containing the new materials developed should be delivered within the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes (2006/C323/01), but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs. Information guides for applications, installation and training on the new solutions should be provided before the end of the project. The participation of public authorities may also be an asset for the proposals, as public authorities own a large part of the building stock at European level.
To maximise their impact, the funded projects will be expected to cluster with each other in order to facilitate research cohesion, integration, and advancement of the EeB-PPP agenda.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 6 and above.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Compared to state of the art materials and components, the newly developed materials should bring:
                   Reduction by at least 30% of the embodied energy and CO2 at component level;
                   Improvement by at least 20% of insulation properties;
                   Reduction by at least 15% of the total costs compared to existing solutions;
                   Demonstration of at least a 5% reduction of the energy spent during the whole life cycle of a building;
                   Improvement of the quality of information from product manufacturers to facilitate better decision making;

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:The refurbishment of the existing building stock requires ground-breaking strategies in order to meet targets for reduced energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most important components to be addressed with an innovative approach is the building envelope, which has to develop into an active rather than a passive element, meeting more functions than just the separation of the outer space from the interior with insulation.
The concept of adaptable envelope is twofold. On the one hand, it is designed to accommodate further modifications (such as future renovation or technology upgrades). On the other hand, the envelope is able to adapt to a dynamic and intricate environment by measuring and processing multi-source information (e.g. outdoor and indoor environment conditions, occupancy, behaviour of users and envelope performance) in order to respond to the building occupant’s instructions and to evolving environmental conditions in an appropriate timing and extent.
Scope: Proposals should address breakthrough solutions to improve roof and façade functional characteristics to enable the building envelope to adapt to a dynamic, mutable and complex environment during its lifetime. Research is expected to cover for example, advanced materials or technologies for energy generation and storage; smart and performance insulation materials; near infrared reflecting and cool coatings; adaptable innovative pre-cast solutions; strategies for improved air quality, moisture control, ventilation control and energy recovery; enhanced acoustic properties; improved fire resistance; automated blinds or movable sun barriers with interrelated issues of summer overheating, air-tightness and natural light use; integration of innovative sensing systems to control and optimise the real time performance of the envelope; or advanced building control systems to control the active envelope.
In addition, proposers should also seek to include in the adaptable envelopes features that could facilitate the future renovation or conversion of the whole or part of the building (fostering creativity and an active role of architects and engineers at design stage), such as:
-          Adaptability to different shapes, taking into account tolerances, façade conditions, stability of existing façades, building orientations and general conditions of the building during its lifetime;
-          Conversion of rooms, or buildings, to new usage;
-          Possibility to integrate new solutions (upcoming technologies) and systems, covering the whole cycle from component design, to the structural aspects and to their installation;
-          Self-adaptation, which is important in relation to current weather and building load situation, and changing use patterns (including new users, or family instead of single users).
-          The integration of the active envelope with building control systems to provide real time control to the envelope according to actual environmental conditions and/or energy demand.
Clear evidence of technical and economic viability should be provided by validating and demonstrating the proposed adaptable envelope in real case retrofitting projects.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.

                Total (primary) energy consumption reduction by a factor 2 to 4 with respect to the values before installation of the adaptable envelope.
                Improved indoor environment.
                Demonstration of the replicability potential in a real case-study.
                Provide solutions with a return on investment below 7 years.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Fuel cell technology is able to address powertrain electrification in the domains of marine propulsion. This market represents high potential for reducing energy consumption and emissions (especially for harbour boats and tugs), because the source of emissions is not as dispersed, i.e. significant energy/ emission savings can be achieved by replacing a single conventional powertrain on a large ship. However, despite all the potential benefits, existing fuel cell technology components face application specific challenges that need to be addressed in order to drive large scale adoption in the marine sector. Hence, in order to achieve competitiveness, additional research and demonstration efforts are required for such drive systems in order to become competitive with conventional technologies.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to develop an emissions-free fuel cell hybrid based powertrain system, suitable for marine applications, and to validate it in the target marine vessel.
The project must address the following key issues:
Identify the components that have specific marine application requirements (e.g. lifetime and resistance to shock, vibration, corrosion, power range, SU/SD, etc.) in comparison to automotive or other vehicular applications
Select amongst the identified components those with highest impact for the marine application in cost and performance
Develop improved, industrialisation-ready system components (including but not limited to: fuel cell stack, compressor, humidifier, intercooler, valves, or turbine/expander, etc.) for high efficiency and low cost Balance-of-Plant (BoP), focused on the specific needs of the marine application
Demonstrate significant improvement of the complete fuel cell based powertrain efficiency and stack lifetime due to integration of improved fuel cell components
Validate the system performance on a powertrain test bench and in a target marine vessel for a period of minimum 6 months
Investigate the CO2 performance (through Life Cycle Analysis techniques) of current marine powertrain solutions and demonstrate the specific emissions saving that can be achieved by replacing conventional technology
TRL at start: 4
TRL at end: 7
The consortium should include at least one marine OEM or their subsidiaries and at least one fuel cell component manufacturer and/or relevant suppliers.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
Expected impacts of the project include:
Fuel to electric efficiency > 42 %
Freeze start capabilities from -35°C
Operational ambient temperature -30°C to +45°C
Powertrain system cost below 6000€/kW
Fuel cell system of at least 75kW
Fuel cell stack life of >15,000 hours
Ability of the system to withstand the shocks, vibrations, saline environment and ship motions commonly encountered on water as well as other marine application relevant requirements.
Taking into account the project achievements (e.g. costs and lifetime), clearly indicate the current state of return on investment for a prospective customer. Out of the business model analysis extract the technological leverages that still have to be considered for future projects.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Thanks to the earlier FCH JU projects (CHIC, High VLOCity, HyTransit, 3EMotion), the hybrid fuel cell bus has made a long way in the urban bus application which continues to show a lot of potential thanks to: a strong and innovative European bus industry; EU, national and local political mandates to reduce emissions and GHG and growing recognition by the operators to electric hybrid traction, in-house fuelling and maintenance.
A large number of cities and operators are prepared to sign-up for large scale demonstrations starting in 2018 and to offer a level playing field with other zero emission options, to meet the next step-change, in number of units, range of models and operational/climate conditions. The majority of European bus OEMs are gearing up to meet the challenge.
In order to further contribute and extend the uptake of fuel cell buses as the next step in the commercialisation process, the following specific challenges have to be met:
1. A further reduction of the capital cost of the fuel cell buses in line with increased volume (total and per site) while at the same time lowering the match funding and the EU contribution.
2. In order to drive the cost to a level of commercial competitiveness with other zero emission technologies, the programme will allow fuel cell buses to:
Eliminate technological barriers identified in previous projects, e.g. by optimizing the hybrid driveline (latest development of batteries in combination with next generation fuel cells) ;
Fully develop the necessary supply chains and value chains for related services, including availability of trained personnel, spare parts, etc…, in order to bring this technology on a par with conventional technologies.
3. Considering that most operators have procured or are in the process of procuring battery electric buses, the challenge for fuel cell buses will be to demonstrate the distinct operating advantages of fuel cell buses;
4. Reduce the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), including fuel, infrastructure and maintenance cost and put the value of societal benefits (environmental, health etc.) in the right perspective as a way to further the use of the technology;
5. Achieve quantified per kilometre well-to-wheel GHG reductions compared with other zero emission alternatives, based on the anticipated revised European Directive for Clean Vehicles [1].
6. Extend the range of potential bus models to all lengths between 9 and 24 meters, including double decker buses.
7. Include range extender models for heavy duty city bus use
8. Include different climate zones and city planning architecture, including interested regions where no FCB demonstration took place so far;
9. Provide answers to the operators as to the degree by which fuel cell buses meet or exceed the fleet operational requirements and expectations, in the different service conditions.
10. Identify and quantify the remaining barriers to market, including financing and merging options with other programmes and sources as well as a plan to implement
11. Provide a “greening pathway” for the production of hydrogen for this application
[1] 2009/33/EC
Scope:
The project will demonstrate a fleet of minimum 125 fuel cell buses and their associated hydrogen infrastructure.
The model range may include urban buses (M3 heavy duty, class 1 or 2) with lengths from 9 m midi buses, 10-12m double decker buses and up to 24m double articulated buses.
The project shall include distinct climate zones as well as different city architecture (including bridges, tunnels, bus lanes etc), with the aim of clearly showing the degree of coping with a vast number of operational challenges.
All buses shall be hybrid (fuel cells and batteries) with brake energy regeneration features.
All buses deployed should have a high level of standardisation between the different bus models offering as a way to lower the cost, increase the acceptance level and facilitate the aftersales service. One of the lessons learned in previous projects is the importance of operator’s involvement from the start to embrace the technology in daily operation. The buses are expected to be close to commercial readiness from both a technical maturity and an economic perspective. Prototypes or small initial series may be procured in the programme subject to the terms of the tender.
To achieve the projected result, at least 100 of the buses will be deployed in larger fleets, these will have a minimum fleet size of 10 buses, and at least 3 of these cities will be deployed in fleets of 20 or more. In addition, up to 5 sites shall procure at least 5 buses. It is recommended to consortium to seek additional source of funding for the related HRS. The buses will be demonstrated for a period of at least 36 months or 150,000 km in operational service and continue service after the project has ended (e.g. the bids could include a commitment as to the minimum period to continue the service after the project has ended). New hydrogen infrastructure or upgrades of existing HRS will also be created.
Buses should have min fuel cell output of 30 kW. Buses below 10m length can be equipped with a fuel cell of minimum of 20 kW.
Buses:
The following is generally applicable for 12m fuel cell bus as defined. These requirements shall serve as a reference guide for other lengths and specifications, which will be stated in the proposals.
Capital price of a 12m bus (as defined in the call) will be less than €625,000 as per referenced general definition [2] and for sites with minimum 20 units. Other lengths with deviations (both minus or plus) in acceptable price ratios to 12m and subject to tender conditions.
Average monthly fleet availability of the buses will be 90% (technical availability after first 6 months as per referenced formula [3])
Hydrogen consumption of 7-9 kg/100 km (combined SORT 1 and 2 for 12m bus)
Fuel cell system MDBF) > 3500 km
Tank-to-wheel efficiency > 42% (in SORT 1 and 2 cycles)
Guaranteed fuel cell stack life (before replacement) of 20,000 hours
Series production ability as a result of the project will has to be demonstrated. Buses shall be certified to operate in regular service.
Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS):
HRS developed under earlier programmes shall show integration of concept and cost down potential of hydrogen storage and production for larger fleets as well as the potential to scale up the capacity;
The cost of dispensed hydrogen offered needs to be consistent with the national or regional strategy on hydrogen prices, if existing. A cost improvement due to increased production capacity and higher utilisation of the HRS is expected.
Hydrogen purity at least 99.999 %
HRS capacity according to fleet requirements, depending on the fleet models and mix, which may be provided by one or more HRSs
HRS availability >98%
Hydrogen price to be maximum 9 €/kg.
At least 60% of the H2 provided to the FCBs must be coming from renewable energy by the end of the project.
The consortium should include multiple bus service providers/operators, refuelling infrastructure providers/operators, fuel retailers, industrial players, local and regional bodies, as appropriate and relevant to the effective delivery of the project.
Proposals should clearly demonstrate the commitment of OEMs to supply vehicles to the project. The involvement of SMEs is encouraged.
TRL level shall be 8 for the buses and TRL level for the HRS shall be at least 8 (at beginning of the project).
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 25 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 6 years
[2] General bus definition (in relation to defined price limit): Basic 12m low entry, class 1 city bus, with 2 doors, air conditioning, min. 30 seats, traction batteries and hybrid drive manually operated handicapped ramp, delivered ex-factory OEM. All IT equipment (except destination signs) delivered by the operator. Extras for special equipment excluded.
[3] Bus fleet availability : Availability F= (∑ (hours State 1)/(∑ (hours State 1) +∑ (hours State 2)). In which: State 1 = total number of hours that the bus is in operation; State 2 = total number of hours that the bus is out of service for technical reasons to be assumed by the bus OEM.
Expected Impact:
The programme is building on the 2016 bus topic call – phase 1 objectives to achieve the next and important step to commercialisation, as defined in the Roland Berger Strategy Consultants’ study “Fuel Cell Electric Buses – Potential for Sustainable Public Transport in Europe”.
The programme has the potential to bridge the gap to full commercialisation in the 2020-22 timeframe.
The specific impact is to show:
data illustrating the degree that cost reductions have been achieved or are achievable, such that the Total cost of ownership of fuel cell buses is or will become competitive to other zero emission technologies (measured on a level playing field conditions) ;
contribute to significant further capital cost reduction; enable start investments in European production facilities for further ramp-up in European markets;
reinforce European supply chain of critical key components by e.g. core components of FC and H2 storage systems to be produced in Europe. Terms in the proposal and/or tenders for the procurement of buses must include arrangements for bus OEMs and their technology suppliers to provide this information.
take advantage of the benefits of renewables as part of the overall EU objective with the transport sector being a prime debtor. With conversion options of redundant electricity from sun and wind energy into hydrogen, and P2G possibilities, hydrogen and fuel cell buses, have the potential to make the business case.
extend to both larger fleets (“leaders”) and allow curious but cautious cities to join (“followers”) thereby initiating an important mainstream process ;
make use of the industrial and innovative lead position of the European bus industry and enhance the local value chain.
The indicative target is that FCH JU funding per bus would not exceed €1800 per kW gross output of the fuel cell, in line with the MAWP targets.
The project should envisage and show evidence of co-funding [4] from other EU, national, regional or private sources in order to demonstrate a strong commitment towards clean propulsion and emission free public transport. Any such co-funding should be fully secured before the signature of the grant agreement to ensure timely realisation of the project.
Proposers should provide a clear evidence of political support for the project together with commitment to further involvement in the roll out should be provided as part of the proposal, through a Letter of Intent a comprehensive exploitation plan for the project should also form part of the proposal.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Cost still remains one of the key challenges for widespread adoption of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC ) technology in the automotive sector. The stack still represents about 50% of total fuel cell system cost and MEA components ca. 60% of the total stack cost. Therefore, despite considerable progress over the last 10 years in increasing performance, durability and reducing platinum loadings, research and development activities are still required to provide materials and designs that can address the cost issue whilst reaching other important targets like durability, reliability and operating temperature.
Additionally, even though several materials were developed that meet performance at BOL, they tend to degrade rapidly and have other issues (e.g. power instability at lower temperatures). Thus, the purpose of this topic is to address these issues by focusing on MEA development to meet all the requirements at the same time, with a greater focus on achieving a world leading power density of 1.8 W/cm2 @ 0.60 V.
Scope:
As a step towards the final cost goal, proposals should focus on reducing the total platinum loading compared to current state of the art MEAs (currently in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mg/cm2) and increasing current density to levels that enable a significant reduction of the total stack active area.
As the targets are very ambitious, the proposals will need to address several areas of development at the same time, which will include work on the following areas:
Catalyst: Development of new catalysts with higher mass-specific activity, durability and active surface area. The catalyst has to be capable of being integrated in a layer that allows operation at higher current densities;
Catalyst Support: Development of corrosion resistant supports which promote optimal layer ionomer distribution and operation at high current densities. These supports have also to meet the durability requirements during dynamic operating conditions, such as start-stop, that lead to high potentials;
Catalyst layer Design: New electrode designs, structured layers and additives to improve performance at high current density and increase durability. Focus to be placed on minimization of mass transport losses while ensuring manufacturability of the layer;
Catalyst Layer ionomer: Ionomers with higher protonic conductivity, higher permeability to O2 and stable behaviour at low RH (<50% RH) and high temperatures (80 - 110 °C);
Membrane: Durable membranes with reduced gas crossover and viable operation at higher temperature (to 110 °C), displaying the proton conductivity of currently available ionomers, or better, and mechanically and chemically stable under RH cycling and OCV conditions;
GDL (including MPL): Development of high through-plane thermal conductivity GDLs to enable low local temperatures at the catalyst layers. Higher in-plane diffusivity GDLs are also desired to reduce the effect of wide landings on bipolar plates. A combination of GDL properties are desired, including reduced thickness, to achieve optimum contact resistance, gas flows under the landings, water management and thermal conduction. Development of MPLs designed for high current densities but with a good balance of water management properties at low temperatures and current densities is needed;
MEA Integration: In addition to incorporating the new component materials into MEAs, it is also within the scope to consider alternative MEA designs, constructions, and deposition and assembly approaches that can contribute to the achievement of the project objectives. Novel designs should maximize the effective use of the constituent materials, enable tailoring to the stack design and minimize the interfacial losses, thereby contributing to the increased performance and reduced cost objectives. This has been addressed in the paragraph below dealing with the output of the project.
The proposal should set targets for each individual component. Those targets need to be quantifiable in single cells relevant for automotive application. The consortium has to demonstrate how the targets have been fixed and how those targets will allow the MEA to achieve the required power density (1.8 W/cm2 @ 0.6 V) in the described operating conditions (already described above).
The output of the project should be a sufficient numbers of MEAs incorporating the new constituent materials and designs that are manufactured by a commercial supplier, by methods compatible with high-volume manufacturing, (but not necessarily using processes already validated for the fuel cell industry), to enable a short-stack test (minimum 10 Cells) of a practical automotive fuel cell.
A cost estimation with assumptions on the quantity of materials, material costs and production costs of the MEA is also expected as an output at the end of the project.
Development of bipolar plates, seals, frame/sub-gasket materials and designs are not in scope of this topic.
TRL at start: 2-3 and TRL at the end of the project: 5.
The proposal is expected to contain at least one OEM as a partner, to provide system and fuel cell design points and counsel on trade off studies. Similarly, to fulfil the manufacturability requirement, it is expected that at least one MEA supplier to be part of the proposal.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 4 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 Years
Expected Impact:
The proposed development activities shall reach the following collective targets, demonstrated at MEA level:
Decreased MEA cost: target MEA cost of 6.0 € /kW based on a production volume of 1 Million m2 per year, assuming Pt spot price of 1,200 €/ troy Oz;
Increased power density: target power density of 1.80 W/cm2 (reference cell voltage: 0.60 V) using Autostack Core bipolar plate as reference (which is commercially available, or a similar bipolar plate with at least 200 cm2, realized as an outcome of a previous FCH 2 JU project). For reproducibility reasons, it is expected that a short stack with a minimum of 10 cells is tested. Operating conditions should be defined by the consortium partners but are recommended to be within the following limits:
Pressure: inlet PCath,An<2.5 bar;
Stoichiometry: 1.3 < λCath,An < 1.5;
Humidity: 30% cath< 70% (relative to coolant inlet temperature);
Temperature: 60 ̊C
10 ̊C
100% H2 concentration at anode inlet;
Increased durability: MEA maximum power loss of 10% after 6,000 hours of operation under a typical customer usage profile (to be defined by consortium, preference is given to profile suggested by the JRC harmonization protocol). Extrapolations from actual durability tests are acceptable beyond 1,000 hours of tests.
Increased operating temperature: MEA capable of operation at coolant outlet temperatures of 105°C and current densities of 1.5 A/cm2 @ 0.67 V for 5% of the lifetime (approx. 300 h). The exact operating conditions and system component assumptions should be provided by OEMs and system integrators to ensure the target is reachable.

Two main barriers to the successful rollout of hydrogen retail infrastructure are still the high cost and the large footprint of hydrogen equipment. In particular, in urban environments, the space available at retail stations is often too small to add hydrogen refueling technology. The problem might become soon a large impediment once hydrogen has been added to the few available spacious sites in a region and only compact sites remain.
Improved station design has also reduced the space needed for hydrogen equipment, making the storage the largest component on hydrogen stations. Storage of conventional fuels, like gasoline, is usually underground, leaving space on the surface for the other components. The development of low-cost, underground storage concepts for compressed gaseous hydrogen is therefore required to enable rollout of a hydrogen refueling network dense enough to meet customer requirements in the 2020’s.
Scope:
The objective of the topic is to design, certify, build and operate for at least 6 months a hydrogen retail station with underground storage of hydrogen, whereby:
The usable amount of hydrogen stored underground is at least 150 kg with a system volume of maximum 0.14 m3/kg;
The pressure of the hydrogen released from the underground storage system is ~ 30 bar;
The system is designed to be refilled from a compressed hydrogen trailer in less than an hour or from an on-site hydrogen generator;
The system can be installed similarly to underground gasoline tanks, without the need for significant (concrete) construction (ideally gasoline tanks should be replaced with hydrogen containing tanks without further need for fortification);
The space above the storage can to a large extent be used for activities necessary on a forecourt (e.g. placement of the hydrogen dispensing equipment, high pressure storage, roads and car parking);
No additional equipment needs to be installed above ground to store or process the hydrogen (apart from normal hydrogen station operations);
The cost of the buffer storage system should be below 750 EUR/kg usable hydrogen and the installation cost below 250 EUR/kg;
The lifetime of the system should be at least 20 years, assuming it is refilled from minimum to maximum (or ‘empty to full’) three times a week.
The hydrogen storage facility should be integrated into a multi-fuel refueling station that dispenses gasoline, diesel, and preferably also LPG and/or CNG to ensure realistic conditions for the safety assessment, certifications and regular inspections. The underground storage may be installed at an existing, planned or new HRS site.
The scope should also include developing recommended procedures for safety assessment and permitting process steps, including co-location of hydrogen storage with other liquid and gaseous fuels. Associated learnings should be documented as case study examples for typical site layouts, as well as for the specific implementation site. The resulting procedures should be made publicly available. Similarly, solutions relevant to the underground storage developed during the project should also be made publicly available, including drawings pictures and/or videos.
The demonstration site should include a minimum of one hydrogen dispenser capable of refueling 350 and 700 bar FCEV. All relevant hydrogen equipment closely associated with the underground storage facility are eligible (e.g. storage vessels, sensors, pipework, civil works, modification costs, planning and permitting costs), while the other components of the station (e.g. dispenser, high pressure storage, compressor or electrolyser) are not eligible costs for the project. “CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform to ensure that the hydrogen dispensed is of renewable nature.
TRL at start: 6 and TRL at end: 8.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.

A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
The project should become a blueprint for the further rollout of underground hydrogen storage at retail stations. It is therefore expected to:
Demonstrate that underground storage of hydrogen is feasible (regarding safety and permitting) and practical (regarding space requirement, lifetime and full cost);
Provide a framework for safety assessment and permitting of future hydrogen stations with underground storage;
Make recommendations as to how such hydrogen stations can be incorporated into harmonised EU standards;
Identify how the hydrogen refueling infrastructure across the EU can be expanded via the demonstrated approach compared with not having underground hydrogen tanks;
Provide ample publicly available material for use in future projects.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
For intercity and long-distance transport of passengers, coaches are used normally. About 20% of all registered buses for public transport are coaches, fuelled primarily by diesel (Euro II to Euro VI [29]). Electrification for these vehicles is not equally advanced in comparison to urban city buses, due to challenges in meeting driving range requirements. In comparison to FC city buses, which have been demonstrated for more than a decade, FC coaches are expected to drive longer distances, typically 400-800 km/day and faster, typically 80-100 km/h on highways. There are very few stops on the route, which results in limited recuperation of breaking energy. Coaches often have a higher energy consumption, due to higher weight and auxiliary systems such as air conditioning. The FC Coach also encounters space constraints for the drive line and hydrogen storage components, since the coaches often carry luggage as well. Learnings and experiences from the FC city buses can be utilized, but the completely different driving pattern, power demand and space constraints require an entirely new FC system design to be validated.
[29] https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/automotive/environment-protection/emissions_en
Scope:
The scope of this topic is to demonstrate first-prototype FC coaches in EU. By utilizing the extensive knowledge of the FC city bus demonstration projects, the FC coach concept should be designed in consideration of the coach specific operational requirements, with special focus on weight and space optimized design of the coach specific hybrid power system (fuel cells, batteries) and the H2 storage tanks.
This topic will address two very different coach segments: long distance coaches and intercity transport coaches, characterized however by similar performance requirements, such as long route distances, high average speeds and high payload and seating capacity requirements. The FC coaches should be of vehicle classes [30]: M3 Class II – destined for regional passenger transport and/or intercity scheduled passenger transport and/or M3 Class III – destined for long distance travel with seated passengers used for tourist coaches enabling long distance travel in EU.
The project should aim at demonstrating at least 6 FC Coaches in the two coach segments (inter-city and long-distance passenger transport) which should fulfil the following requirements:
The FC coach should integrate a fuel cell system of min. 100 kW (net power) or 100% of the energy consumption should come from hydrogen. Other intermediate solutions could be tested during the project but the consortium should demonstrate how they will reach this objective in the long term;
The fuel cell modules should prove durability of at least 25,000h. At the end of the demonstration phase a monthly availability > 85% of the operation time (excluding preventive maintenance time) should be demonstrated;
The FC coach should demonstrate driving speed up to 100 km/h;
Vehicle range should follow intercity/long-distance end user’s needs (minimum 400 km between refuelling) and standard comfort requirements equal to diesel buses;
For standardization reasons, the hydrogen tanks should be based on existing standard H2 storage solutions ;
Vehicle weight and size should not grow beyond the current state of the art or beyond current certification limits;
Hydrogen fuel consumption should be less than 10kg/100km according to the Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool (VECTO) [31] mission profile driving cycle;
The FC coaches should be operated for minimum two years, and minimum of 80,000 km per coach per year with a minimum daily travel distance of 100 km for the M3 Class III type bus;
Fully developing the necessary supply chain with focus on a healthy and diversified EU value chains (e.g. drivetrain, FC stacks and systems, tanks among others) and second sources for related services, including availability of trained personnel, spare parts etc. in order to bring this technology on a parity with conventional technologies;
The activities of the project should at least include:
Optimization of driveline for fuel efficiency and operating range; optimize hybrid FC + battery design, given absence of (frequent) stop-and-go, i.e. limitations of brake energy recuperation;
Optimization of fuel economy, given the different duty cycle (maximum speed, average speed, relative (in)sensitivity to topography, climate and load variations); optimize performance, output of fuel cell and traction battery for best fuel efficiency and cost;
Optimize space utilization in relation to the location of H2 tanks, given the required operating range(s), considering both passenger and luggage bays minimum volume(s) requirements;
H2 refuelling plan and operating range requirements, i.e. refuelling options and time, based on the use case and range requirements;
Safety assessments, given the location of the drive components and the storage tanks, with the objective to meet or exceed existing safety standards;
Establishment of new hydrogen refuelling stations, HRS is not considered in scope of the topic; upgrade of existing stations is however considered to be as part of the scope.
TRL at start of the project: 6 and TRL at the end of the project: 8.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
Activities developing test protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of fuel cell components should foresee a collaboration mechanism with JRC (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC""), in order to support EU-wide harmonisation. Test activities should adopt the already published FCH 2 JU harmonized testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify progress at programme level.
“CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform [32] to ensure that the hydrogen produced and dispensed at the HRS is of renewable nature.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contribution above this amount will not be evaluated.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Electrification of railway network is high on the agenda of EU. Currently, only 60% of the track in EU is electrified and it is much less in the East European member nations. Fuel cell technology is able to address powertrain electrification in the domains of rail propulsion, both for regional trains and shunt locomotives. This market represents high potential for reducing energy consumption and emissions, because the source of emissions is not dispersed i.e. significant energy/ emission savings can be achieved by replacing a single conventional powertrain on a large train. However, despite all the potential benefits, existing fuel cell technology components face application specific challenges that need to be addressed in order to drive large scale adoption in the rail sector. Hence, in order to achieve competitiveness with conventional technologies, additional research efforts are required.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to develop an emission-free fuel cell based powertrain system, suitable for rail applications, and to validate it in the target rail vehicle.
The project must address the following key issues:
Identify the components that have specific rail application requirements (e.g. lifetime and voltage levels, load cycle, power range, SU/SD, etc.) in comparison with automotive or other vehicular applications
Select amongst the identified components those with highest impact for the rail application in cost and performance
Develop improved, industrialisation-ready system components (including but not limited to: fuel cell stack, compressor, humidifier, intercooler, valves, or turbine/expander, etc.) for high efficiency and low cost Balance-of-Plant (BoP), focused on the specific needs of the rail application
Demonstrate significant improvement of the complete fuel cell based powertrain efficiency and stack lifetime due to integration of improved fuel cell components
Validate the system performance both on a powertrain test bench and a target rail vehicle over a period of minimum 6 months
Investigate the CO2 performance (through Life Cycle Analysis techniques) of current rail powertrain solutions and demonstrate the specific emissions saving that can be achieved by replacing conventional technology
TRL at start: 4
TRL at end: 7
The consortium should include at least one rail OEM or their subsidiaries and at least one fuel cell component manufacturer and/or relevant suppliers.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3-4 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
Expected impacts of the project include:
Fuel to electric efficiency > 42 %
Freeze start capabilities from -35°C
Operational ambient temperature -30°C to +45°C
Powertrain system cost below 6000€/kW
Power range at least 200kW
System lifetime > 15,000 hours (with one stack change permitted)
Taking into account the project achievements (e.g. costs and lifetime), clearly indicate the current state of return on investment for a prospective customer. Out of the business model analysis extract the technological leverages that still have to be considered for future projects. Demonstration that the powertrain system and component lifetime will eventually allow for reasonable return on investment in each industry and make mass commercialisation an attractive option
Formulation of initial go-to market strategy with support from stakeholders from the rail industry.
Potential for future demonstration ‘innovation’ actions once the project is completed"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Fuel cell APUs can contribute not only additional electric power vehicles but also heat for cabin temperature control. Possible applications include hybrid and electric passenger cars, vans and trucks as well as other manned commercial off-road vehicles such as for municipal, airfield-, agricultural- (etc.) use. Later on, a carryover of these fuel cell systems to non-road applications such as airplanes, electric boats etc. can be easily achieved. Further, such systems could also be the basis for range extender concepts as explicitly addressed in the MAWP.
The main specific challenge to be tackled is also addressed in the techno-economic objective 1 of the MAWP of the FCH 2 JU: reduce the production cost of the fuel cell system to be used in an APU transport application, while increasing its lifetime to levels competitive with conventional technologies and also reducing weight and volume where space is at a premium.
Scope:
The overall objective is to design, develop and test APU fuel cell systems against realistic specific requirements covering the main application field, i.e. on- and off-road vehicles. Requirements of other applications have to be collected and considered as far as possible. The project should also address auxiliary subsystems optimization on the basis of automotive FC systems for road propulsion.
In more detail, the objective of this project is to develop low cost fuel cell APU systems for transport application by means of latest system and component level RTD methodologies and tools. Also all balance of plant components need to be addressed. After key component and system testing, the components and systems shall be further developed towards the target system for the surface transport APU application. Design-to-cost methodologies shall be applied to analyse cost and to identify cost reduction opportunities for further improvements of the respective components.
Project proposals should focus on development of APU systems which can be integrated in (already existing) vehicles. Consortia shall define and identify all external operating conditions which are specific to the particular application. All transport applications are eligible under this topic.
Projects are expected to cover the following top-level objectives:
Electric power output relevant for real life operations depending on the actual application.
Significant improvement of the complete powertrain efficiency due to integration of a fuel cell APU
Integration of fuel cell APUs into final application with the coupling to pre-existing electric (e.g. battery) systems in order to optimize the whole energy chain on board.
Advanced hybrid operating strategies enabling elimination of idling or warm-up losses etc.
Validation of the results in a prototype APU systems in applications under real world operating conditions including monitoring for operating feedback analysis for further developments
Prototype testing in a relevant end user environment
Proof of the safety of the FC system for embedded applications due the integration and system architecture with regards to safety needs
Expected Impact:
Overall impacts of the results of the project have to be:
Tank-to-electricity efficiency of at least 35%
Cost reduction of the APU system enabling a return of investment period of the APU system of below 2 years
Lifetime to be compatible with the selected vehicle application
Minimized fuel cell APU system packaging volume/weight to be compatible with the selected vehicle application

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The FCH JU is developing a hydrogen bus commercialisation activity. This will develop and implement a business case for the roll-out of 500-1000 buses on Europe’s roads before 2020.
Today’s practice across Europe is that buses refuel at their depots. One of the main challenges to a vision of a commercial fuel cell bus offering is the lack of evidence and understanding about how a large scale bus depot would maintain and refuel a large fleet of buses. Currently the largest bus fleets fuelled at a single depot have between 5 and 20 buses (100-400kg of hydrogen per day). Commercial bus depots could require 75-300 buses to refuel in one day (1,500-6,000kg of hydrogen per day for a typical European 12m bus). This is further complicated by the fact that buses frequently operate for the vast majority of the day and night - an entire depot’s fleet could need to refuel within a 4-6 hour window, leading to a requirement for very rapid sequential or parallel filling. Additionally specific hydrogen-ready maintenance facilities are not yet in place.
Hydrogen fuelling systems on this scale have not been developed to a high degree of technical readiness. In order to reduce implementation risks on the pathway to commercialisation and to increase planning certainty, detailed engineering work to understand the options, technical challenges, practical implications and costs of refuelling on a bus depot scale is required. In addition, there may be benefits arising from a hydrogen demand of this scale in unlocking innovative routes to hydrogen production and supply.
Scope:  The project will involve a consortium of bus depot operators, hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) equipment suppliers (at least 3), fuel cell bus developers, hydrogen producers and potentially cities or public transport authorities carrying out a series of detailed engineering studies for specific bus depots across Europe to develop viable refuelling systems for large hydrogen bus fleets. Consortia may opt to include some of the relevant stakeholders in an observer group.  The objective for the project is the production of detailed engineering design studies for a minimum of five representative bus depots, from at least three member states across Europe. The studies will consider the hydrogen fuelling station requirements for at least 75 – 150 buses operating from the bus depots. The outputs may feed into business planning activities at a local and European level.
The work will consider the range of options for supplying hydrogen to bus depots, including off-site production (including different options for delivery of hydrogen) and on-site production. For each depot, the local circumstances should be assessed. For each site a pathway to decarbonisation of that hydrogen will be developed in line with local CO2 emission reduction aspirations. The engineering work should focus on assessing a range of technical solutions, narrowing down on a preferred option and then assessing the implications of that solution in terms of the costs of the solution, the components needed, the approvals and permissions processes and the practical implications for the bus depot. Where opportunities exist for standardising components or specifications, these should be assessed across the five depots considered.
In each depot, the practical implications of supplying a volume of hydrogen on an unprecedented scale will be developed. The aim here will be to understand the additional administrative and practical burdens which large fuelling systems of this type will place on bus depot operators. In addition, the engineering teams should work with bus depot operators on potential solutions to these challenges (e.g. changes in filling patterns). Here, the aim will be to achieve a balance between the cost of changes to the way bus depots are operated and the cost of the filling solution.
For each location, the implications of local regulations, codes and standards on the designs will be assessed, and the teams will ensure that the process for obtaining approvals and permission to operate stations on busy bus depots is well understood and can be met. Where new regulations are required at these larger scales, or there is merit in challenging existing regulations, this will be highlighted by the consortium
The consortium is responsible for assembling the data produced from the design studies into data appropriate for dissemination both within the consortium and to those participating in the FCH JU’s bus commercialisation project. A public dissemination exercise based on a reduced version of this dataset will also ensure that the lessons learned are available to stakeholders in the wider bus industry (both potential providers and users of hydrogen infrastructure).
Expected impact:
•             A study covering the high level principles of large refuelling station designs (more than 1,500kg per day) to allow an identification of the factors which lead to the lowest costs of hydrogen supply at a range of specific bus depots 
•             Given that a number of operators/regions are likely to be interested in the design study process and that is possible that more operators will be affiliated with the study than those for whom there will be resources for technical studies, the consortium will need to:
o             Provide a mechanism to down-select depots for detailed design work
o             Provide a mechanism to allow any operators who are not selected to remain associated with the study and learn from the technical work carried out
•             For the selected depots (minimum five):
o             Establish a performance specification for the bus depot HRS
o             Conduct an initial options study to assess the range of configurations for the supply of a large fleet of hydrogen buses
o             For each of the options considered, an indicative assessment of the parameters which influence the cost of hydrogen supply and practical implication should be undertaken 
o             Work with the local partners to down-select to one preferred option for detailed design work
o             Develop detailed designs of the refuelling station equipment required for the preferred options at each depot
o             Provide budgeting information for each of the station detailed designs, in terms of both indicative capital and operating costs. Methodologies to respect anti-trust legislation for data sharing need to be implemented. Report on the impact of local regulations codes and standards on the feasibility of the different depot designs, including a comparative study on the situation in different member states and recommendations on where new regulations or revisions to existing regulations would facilitate installation of large HRS
o             Consortia may choose to investigate necessary adjustments to dedicated hydrogen bus maintenance facilities in terms of safety, tooling requirements, accessibility to roof-top installations and spare parts availability
o             Develop a view on the potential for cost reduction through time and/or compromises which could be made by the bus operators in the performance requirements of the station to achieve this
o             Establish a forum for exchange of data across the depot design projects on the potential for standardisation of the approach (or specific components)
Knowledge sharing around the engineering solutions generated is an important aspect of the project. The successful consortium will ensure that the following data is shared with relevant consortium member groups and relevant participants in the FCH JU’s bus commercialisation efforts respecting sensitive commercial boundaries:
•             High level description of the strategy for supplying hydrogen to  the respective investigated bus depot
•             Indicative layouts for the preferred depot design, indicating the land take and safety zones neutralised by the presence of hydrogen at the depot
•             Description of the operational constraints imposed by the fuelling station on the depots
•             Indicative cost information for each depot. Data should be sufficient to allow parties to develop a business plan for implementing the preferred fuelling solution
•             Information on the environmental footprint of the hydrogen supply options
•             Information on required adaption of maintenance facilities (if investigated)
In addition, the consortium will ensure that an aggregated selection of the data above can be made available in a public format to allow those looking to start similar initiatives access to the data required to assess large scale bus depot fuelling."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Hydrogen as a clean energy carrier has a very high potential to contribute to Europe’s climate and sustainability targets for 2030 and beyond, in particular for mobility. At the same time studies  show that fuel cell vehicles (FCEVs) could be competitive with conventional vehicles on total cost of ownership basis already in the 2020’s. However, this vision is constrained by the high early cost of deploying a refuelling infrastructure for an initially limited vehicle fleet. Additionally, it is still necessary to improve FCEV technology and to strengthen customer acceptance, a pre-requisite for successful commercialisation.
In this context, increased reliability, durability, availability and efficiency levels in real operation need to be demonstrated for a significant number of FCEVs and hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS).
Large scale demonstrations of this type are essential to gain real life operational experience, test the attractiveness of FCEVs for customers, and subsequently develop a matching customer value proposition and best business case scenarios.
A number of national or regional initiatives (mostly known under the term “H2Mobility”) for planning and development of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure networks in European member states have already commenced. They aim to tackle the challenges of the early years of hydrogen mobility’s roll-out by building consensus and synchronising investments. One part of their plans is to prove the necessary technology readiness level for commercialisation in field tests and demonstration projects. It should be highlighted that if the first phase of these “H2Mobility” initiatives demonstrates a plausible business case, it is likely that additional actors and investors will become easier to attract and thereby it will create a virtuous circle towards commercial roll-out of FCEVs. Though the different initiatives follow different approaches, all have common elements and goals. For example, they all share high risk levels for the related investments.
This topic calls for consortia to propose a large scale demonstration project for HRSs and FCEVs in alignment and cooperation with national or regional roll-out activities to underpin the early stages of these initiatives and further stimulate hydrogen infrastructure’s build-up across Europe. In particular, the project should aim at benchmarking and establishing links between the existing initiatives in order to synchronize actions and maximise impact Europe wide. The ultimate objective is to complement these existing initiatives, avoiding duplications or mere replications of thereof.
Scope:  The project will focus on the roll-out of a minimum of 100 FCEVs and 23 HRS capable of meeting the performance targets specified in the “Impact” section of this topic.  In general, they should represent the best technology available at the time of project implementation.
Proposers should provide a clear evidence of:   
•             OEMs’ commitment to supplying to the project vehicles (passenger cars and/or utility vehicles) which are in a status of possible series production (at least TRL 7) and have the potential of high market penetration in the future. This should be treated as a key requirement for funding
•             A comprehensive strategy for commercialisation, including (novel) ways to attract the customers by appropriate customer value proposition scenarios
•             An evidence of political support for the project together with commitment to further involvement in the roll out must be provided as part of the proposal, through a Letter of Intent
•             Justification of the way in which the project will concretely contribute to de-risking commercialisation of FCEVs in Europe
•             A comprehensive business-plan, for the project should also form part of the proposal. Where contributions from end users to vehicles’ costs are assumed, this should be clearly indicated in the project proposal
•             Further activities for deployment of HRS and FCEVs additional to the project have to be shown
The main focus of the project will be on FCEVs which use a fuel cell system as the main power source and 700 bar hydrogen storage systems. Range extenders concepts and other hydrogen storage concepts are eligible on condition of demonstrating their pertinence for specific applications. The minimum operation for the last vehicles introduced in the project is 12 months or 10,000 km and the minimum operation for the last HRS built is 2 years. Other vehicles and HRSs are expected to be driven or operated for a longer period or range.
When addressing the passenger car market, filling stations need to be accessible for private customers/users and should preferably be integrated in forecourts of conventional refuelling stations. When addressing the utility vehicle market or local fleets, filling stations might be located on private forecourts, with or without public access, as long as several customers are already identified.
The stations’ locations need to be chosen in a way consistent with the creation of a real European network. The demonstration sites must be located in more than one EU member state where H2 Mobility initiatives or similar initiatives aiming at deployment of hydrogen based mobility are in place, in order to enjoy the positive dynamic of these states and to have the best leverage effect. Where relevant, it is recommended that demonstration sites should be located at, or close to, the network of the Trans-European Transport Network (TENT-T), as laid out in Regulation 1315/2013. The selected regions should have a high number of potential customers. Ideally, the project should contribute to assure a minimum HRS coverage in at least one large densely populated regions or cluster, in order to test the willingness of customers to switch to FC vehicles.
The stations may include on site hydrogen production if economically justified.
Ensuring cross-fertilization of knowledge acquired throughout the project will be of key importance and therefore priority will be given to proposals presenting a comprehensive dissemination guaranteeing that the lessons learnt by the project are made available to wider public.  In particular, it should be ensured that countries considering development of similar FCEVs/HRS roll-out initiatives should have an easy access to information generated by the consortium.
Additionally, measurement, monitoring and evaluation of specific vehicle and fuelling station parameters (including onsite hydrogen production where appropriate), using methodology such as the one delivered by the HyLights project, is to be performed in order to highlight the potential of the technology for stakeholders along the value chain and raise their interest.
The use of renewable and low carbon hydrogen for the purposes of the project is recommended and will be considered an advantage during evaluation.
The consortium should include multiple automotive OEMs, refuelling infrastructure providers and operators, fuel retailers, and other actors as appropriate. The composition of the consortium should facilitate establishment of strong links with “H2Mobility” initiatives. The involvement of SMEs is also encouraged.
Expected impact: This project shall have a major impact on the FCH mobility deployment in Europe and shall significantly contribute to coordination of“H2Mobility” initiatives at the European scale.
It will develop, deliver and operate hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and a fleet of FCEVs. For both a comprehensive performance monitoring is to be carried out, as a result of which recommendations for technological and commercialisation strategy improvements are to be formulated. Particular emphasis shall be put on the investigation of customer behaviour with a view to proposing actions to increase customer acceptance of FCEVs. 
A comprehensive monitoring program together with an in-depth analysis of the data obtained will address the following points:
•             The techno-economics of the stations and vehicles deployed on the project vs. the targets identified in the national or regional roll-out strategies as well as the MAWP
•             Customer acceptance and the willingness of local populations to switch to FC vehicles when a minimum HRS coverage is in place
•             Determination of any new obstacles on the way to hydrogen mobility and assessment of progress towards overcoming the barriers to the roll-out of FCEVs that have been identified in the national or regional programmes, including, for example:
o             Metering of hydrogen
o             Quality Assurance issues around hydrogen purity
o             Integration of hydrogen into conventional vehicle fuel forecourts
o             Land availability for hydrogen stations
o             RCS issues surrounding consenting for hydrogen stations
o             Standard Operation procedures for refuelling
•             Customer profiles in order to establish HRS utilization patterns in an early market
•             Definition of best practices for mass market roll-out
 Project partners are expected to explicitly demonstrate the way in which a demonstration project of this type will help raise public awareness and public support for the technology.
A comprehensive dissemination campaign is expected through the project with maximum outreach possible.
The HRS under the project shall comply with the following requirements:
•             For passenger cars, provide a clear network, with a maximum driving distance between stations equal to half the range of the lowest range fuel cell vehicle deployed in the same region
•             For utility vehicles, a significant level of utilization per station must be demonstrated and a vision of how these stations belong to the creation of a future network shall be defined
•             Comply with requirements of the directive on the deployment of alternative fuel infrastructure package directive (to be imminently published), particularly as regards its standardization requirements. Exceptions may be allowed, if justified by the application (e.g. utility vehicles)
•             The HRS shall deliver 700bar H2 and be sized consistently with the deployment strategy for the country. The minimum refuelling capacity shall not be below the threshold of 150 kg of daily refuelling capacity per station for fixed stations. Options for capacity increase at highly frequented stations shall be considered. Mobile stations can be proposed
•             Some 350bar HRS (maximum 5) can also be proposed if they are associated with a significant fleet of vehicles close to market readiness (TRL at least 7). In that case, an up-grade strategy to 700bar, or a bi-pressure station (350bar and 700bar) should be proposed if coherent with the foreseen customer(s) requirement(s)
•             Availability of the station 97% (measured in usable operation time of the whole filling station)
•             Cost of dispensed hydrogen offered in the project to be consistent with the national or regional strategy on hydrogen pricing. Cost improvements due to increased hydrogen production capacity and especially higher utilization rate of the HRSs is anticipated in the course of the project (target <10€/kg)
•             Hydrogen purity has to be at least 99.999 %.  Vehicle refuelling process must comply with SAE J2601 and IR communication needs to comply with SAE J 2799. Exceptions may be allowed, if justified by the application
•             Station hydrogen production efficiency target at 50 – 70%, depending on the method of production (conversion efficiency of the whole production chain from primary energy to filling nozzle)
 Technical targets for FCEVs:
•             >5,000h vehicle operation lifetime initially, min 6,000h lifetime as program target
•             Major power source of vehicles must be a fuel cell system (except for utility vehicles where range extended concepts can be proposed)
•             MTBF >1,000 km
•             Availability >95% (to be measured in available operation time)
•             Tank-to-wheel efficiency >40%, measured in the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC)
•             Principle series production ability has to be shown
 Cost target for FCEVs:
The consortium has to show the potential to reduce cost of vehicles to the cost targets indicated in the MAWP. Funding is limited to 500 € per kW of installed power in those vehicles where the fuel cell is the primary power source, and to 2000 € per kW where the fuel cell acts as a range extender. A lower contribution should be requested for vehicles coming in the second half of the project, to reflect the cost reduction brought by new generation vehicles.
Apart from liaising with “H2Mobility initiatives”, links to relevant projects co-funded by the FCH JU should be established when deemed of benefit (e.g. the HIT project).
Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html."

Then, to achieve cost reduction in the operation of electrolysers, efforts are needed to align them with the provision of specific electricity grid services, which are going to be required by EU transmission and distribution grids due to the foreseen high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES).
Based on the study “Development of Water Electrolysis in the European Union”* providing grid services is expected to require start-stop and dynamic operation and high efficiency across the load curve. On the other hand, future technological targets- as stated in the MAWP 2014-2020 – have overlooked the different services brought to the grid, specifically when regarding flexibility of operation and cold-hot start features.
Although the importance of dynamic operation to provide grid services is clearly stated in both documents, no special indication has been made to consider or segregate the performance of the systems depending on the specific services to be provided, the scale of the electrolyser or the load to be covered (depending on end uses for the generated hydrogen). The technical innovations required for electrolyser systems to be able to perform grid services are clearly pointed out, but also there is a requirement for economic analyses for identifying the business case advantages if electrolysers are able to offer higher levels of response, or various combinations of service, to the electricity grid.
The challenge is not only for efforts focused on developing better components and systems able to meet the already proposed KPIs, but also to further develop and prepare benchmarks at component and system levels. Additionally, set up standardized tests to study which are the specific indicators and performance requirements for each grid service to be provided, considering the feedback from Transmission/Distribution system operators (TSO/DSO). The grid needs balancing at all levels within the electricity high, medium, low voltages network (HV, MV, LV) and with reference to the distinct variabilities caused by solar PV and/or wind power. And further that the aggregation of individual electrolyser loads can make a large contribution to grid services in a region.

Scope:
Proposals should aim to achieve the following advances:
Benchmarking of components and assessment of improvements through a specific testing methodology specially defined to evaluate the ability of the electrolyser to provide response suitable for each possible grid service (e.g. power quality and harmonics, primary and secondary reserve, frequency regulation, voltage management and provision of VARs, RES balancing, peak shaving, avoidance of curtailment)
Standardization of a testing protocol to evaluate the ability, regarding features, of electrolysers to provide grid services, taking into account the design consideration of the impact of safety requirements (safety check and start-up routines) upon response times from cold and warm starts
Establishment of power curves to be introduced for the emulation of T&D grids for electrolysers providing each grid service in relation to their features (e.g. depending on nominal and maximum power, type of technology). Characterization of different operation modes to provide each different grid service
Benchmarking and comparison of components at state of art stack level, tested according to the standardized procedures for the provision of grid services, identifying potential improvements opportunities
Testing power electronics, stack and balance of plant aiming at providing flexibility and rapid response to the whole system without compromising overall efficiency, safety and cost
Defining indicators aligned with previous studies and 2020 KPIs from the MAWP, updating them to be consistent with minimum part load and dynamic targets expressed for each technology paving the way to include these capabilities in target scales for 2020 with further consideration of electrolysers of >3MW
Defining and providing experimental evidence through the protocols tested and from feedback from end users to better define the future targets related with flexibility and/or reactivity as a function of the service provided, considering also potential degradation of the efficiency and lifetime duration (e.g. 1.5% efficiency degradation/year). Targets to be tested and proposals to redefine them will be aligned with the actual indicators of flexibility/reactivity:
Power factor >0.95
Operating range from 5 to 200% Nominal power
<2 seconds from minimum to maximum power
<2 seconds from maximum to minimum power
Cold start (from 0 to minimum power) in 30 seconds
Assessment of CAPEX and OPEX considering the provision of each different, and a combination of, grid services for electrolyser components and systems (to include revenues, electricity costs, replacement and maintenance of the proposed solutions, and balancing services payments). Although proposals will contribute to update KPIs on CAPEX, OPEX to consider revenues, electricity costs, replacement, maintenance of the proposed solutions, and balancing services payments (this is, considering the case and specificities of grid services provision), applicants are expected to consider and build on MAWP targets for efficiency (48 kWh/kg for PEM and 52 kWh/kg for alkaline electrolysers) and production cost (2.0 M€/t/d for 1000 kgH2/day of production) with no significant deviations
Definition of a business model showing the stakeholders (including DSO/TSO, generators, consumers, electrolysers operators/owners), the interrelations and the economic flows and incentives to foster introduction of electrolysers for grid operation to provide services at different scales of the electrical network. Technical, economical, legal, environmental and social aspects will be considered to define a suitable business model, considering the differences and particularities in relation to each member state and impacting this project
Assessment of the services with the highest potential (considering economic, technical, legal and environmental aspects) to compete or be a strong alternative in relation to other existing energy storage systems (ESS) and/or smart grid approaches considering the electrolyser size, and features as well as the possible end uses of hydrogen
Market potential assessment to determine the best cases and countries for introduction of electrolysers providing grid services and roadmap for implementation at EU level
The consortium should have 1 manufacturer as a partner, and both TSOs and DSOs representation in an advisory board. Preferably the advisory board should also include further electrolyser manufacturers and organisations relevant to grid services or hydrogen applications"". To be eligible for participation a consortium must contain at least one constituent entity of the Industry or Research Grouping.
Projects are expected to start at TRL 4 and to reach TRL 6 regarding protocols development (not electrolyser development).
Proposals should build upon experience and results from previously funded projects both on national and/or European levels, including results from previous FCH JU projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Duration: 3 years
A maximum of 1 project will be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
The project should achieve the following impacts:
Contribute to a better understanding of the expected transient behaviour and features of electrolysers when providing grid services and of efficiency across the load curve to manufacturers. This effort should lead to further definition of specific KPIs for dynamic operation to provide grid services

Paving the way to achieve a standard performance of electrolysers to provide grid services (using hydrogen for different end uses), showing their potential against/combined with other ESS or approaches to reinforce electrical networks and allow wide penetration of RES
Specific performance indicators for the provision of each grid service will be defined from a clear understanding of the technical performance and economic factors

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
When monitoring water electrolysis related literature over the last few years, one can find many promising ideas and performance claims at laboratory scale that hold a lot of potential for the future of hydrogen generation. However, very few of them have made it to a commercial scale. This call aims at moving these findings and technologies to the next stage of engineering so they can disruptively alter electrolysis technologies and lead to a game changing electrolyser.
This topic aims to develop game changing PEM or alkaline electrolysers with the potential to surpass the FCH-JU KPI’s in terms of cost, efficiency, lifetime and operability. Principal expected areas of game changing development are: high pressure operation, rapid response, increased energy density, reduced critical raw materials and/or high temperature operation, but the topic remains open to other innovations.
The proposed technology is aiming to address the following application for the relevant energy sector of:
higher pressure electrolysis for reducing mechanical compression requirements and so improving the energy performance of electrolyser-HRS or of power-to-gas systems injecting hydrogen into the high-pressure gas transmission network;
rapid response electrolysis to enable the participation of electrolysers in the most demanding grid balancing markets (primary reserve);
higher current density operation to enable more compact installations;
higher temperature electrolysis to improve conversion efficiency.
Scope:
The operating characteristics of existing PEM and alkaline electrolysers limit their implementation in prospective commercial applications. Output pressures are generally <35bar (PEM) and <10 bar (Alkaline). This requires compressors in several applications, which place energy, space and cost penalties on the electrolyser. Existing response times of minutes or tens of seconds preclude their application in grid balancing markets, some of which demand sub-second response. Current densities of <2A/cm2 for PEM and <0.5A/cm2 for Alkaline provide footprint constraints. Operating temperatures are typically 60-75 Celsius, but increases of only 10C can make a large improvement in conversion efficiency. For these reasons, several step changes are desirable.
The scope of this Topic is the development of a prototype PEM or alkaline based electrolyser, including stack and balance of plant. The reduction of costs for PEM and alkaline electrolysers is the main target. To reach that, proposals should focus at least on one or more of the following priorities:
high pressure electrolysis with hydrogen output pressure of at least 100 bar;
rapid response of below 1 second for a hot start and below 10 seconds for a cold start;
increased base load current density to at least 4 A/cm2 for PEM or 1 A/cm2 for Alkaline;
increased peak-load current density for short periods of up to 1 hour to above 6 A/cm2 for PEM or above 1.5 A/cm2 for alkaline;
electrolysis at water temperature of above 80°C;
other step-change improvements in water electrolyser stacks or balance of plant which can significantly improve efficiency or cost.
Each of these requires detailed attention to cell and BoP development, especially with respect to the reduction of critical raw materials (such as catalysts) and the advancement of the EU supply chain. The capacity of the prototype is expected to be around 10 to 50 kW base load, but larger capacities are in scope as well. However, the technology developed should be suitable for multi-MW scale electrolysers.
Project proposals should clearly state the expected commercial benefits of the proposed technology improvements and projects should include an assessment to verify these benefits.
The prototype must be tested under steady and, if relevant, transient operating conditions, achieving cumulative running time of at least 2000 hours. Rates of degradation should be measured and, if necessary, routes to conformance with the 2023 target in the MAWP must be proposed. Testing should be done in accordance to the FCH JU harmonised testing procedures developed by the JRC in collaboration with European industry and researchers.
The consortium should include at least one electrolyser manufacturer, research institution or academic group.
It is expected that the technology starts at TRL 3 and reaches TRL 5 at the end of the project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
A step-change improvement in water electrolysis is expected, enabling additional commercial roll-out of electrolysers post 2025:
the development and validation of a prototype game changer electrolyser;
new knowledge with respect to the design and operation of an electrolyser with one or more of the improvements mentioned;
Assessment of the additional commercial opportunities that are achievable with the game changer electrolyser compared with current electrolysers.
With further development, the technology must be able to meet or surpass the efficiency, lifetime and cost targets set out in the MAWP of 50kWh/kg @ 1000kg/day, 1.5M€/ (t/d), <1s hot start, <10s cold start (table 3.1.1.2) and the central trend lines in the Study on development of water electrolysis in the EU [E4Tech and Element Energy, Feb 2014]."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
It has been estimated that 1.2 billion people globally will be without electricity access by 2025 [1], in addition 1 billion people are connected to unstable networks and are regularly exposed to power outages [2]. It may thus be considered that 2.2 billion people (i.e. around 35% of the global population) are “under-electrified” [3] with a massive use of diesel generation. Indeed, with an installed diesel production capacity of 600GW [4], for which it has been estimated that half is installed on off-grid sites [5], the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions is mandatory.
Isolated areas in Europe (e.g. villages, alpine refuges or 1000s of islands) where micro-grid are present in general have high electricity generation cost. Since the production of electricity generally derives from thermal plants powered by fossil fuels, like combined cycle plants or diesel electrical plants, the cost of electrical energy is heavily dependent on the cost of these fossil fuels, their logistics and their transport. Thus, the cost per kilowatt-hour delivered to the end user is definitively higher than that associated with connection to the main network.
The need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and to reduce energy costs has guided the investment policies of certain isolated territories in recent years so that, as an example, today numerous islands have significant renewable energy capacity or plan to invest in this sector.
However, most of these isolated territories have not yet been able to guarantee their independence from fossil fuels mainly because of renewables intermittency, thus exploitation of the full potential for energy production by their renewable energy plants is still missing.
Ultimately, RES electricity generation cost is very low. In these conditions of very cheap RES electricity, positive business cases can be built using excess or additional RES to power electrolysers, use hydrogen as energy storage medium and reconvert hydrogen into electricity with fuel cell technology when requested by end-users.
The specific challenge of the topic is to promote in isolated micro-grid and/or off grid sites the implementation of reliable and clean integrated power solution based on fuel cell technology for:
decreasing the use of fossil fuel and CO2 emission;
decreasing the cost of energy;
adoption of RES electricity storage in chemical form (hydrogen) thus enabling wind and solar power to act as stand-alone primary energy sources, solving the intermittency issue for a better security in power supply; and
increasing the energy supply independence.

Scope:
The goal of this topic is to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of fuel cell technologies generating electrical energy in off-grid or isolated micro-grid areas, as stand-alone solution integrated with renewables via electrolyser.
Fuel cell technologies in the power range of 5-200 kW will be demonstrated in minimum 2 sites. Minimum 200 kW total capacity production of power will be demonstrated. Such large power range will allow to address different load requirement of isolated sites (e.g. from single homes to schools).
Existing source of renewable energy will be used, while demonstration of electrolyser of at least 500 kW and storage equipment is in the scope of the project.
The project should:
Validate real demonstration units in representative applications of isolated micro-grid or off-grid areas, in order to enable suppliers, end users and general stakeholders to gain experience throughout the value chain; and
Demonstrate the added value of the fuel cell-based energy storage solutions with respect to alternative technologies in terms of economics, technical capabilities and environmental benefits.
Further objectives:
Demonstration through field applications of the advantages of innovative technologies (hardware or software) including, but not limited to, monitoring, control, diagnosis, lifetime estimation, new BoP components.
Online monitoring of operating conditions, load demands and system output will provide initial data to determine the overall efficiency of the system within the testing period.
Optimization of power electronics to guarantee a proper integration of fuel cell products with the renewable source and end user/microgrid.
The project will be open to all fuel cell technologies.
Field demonstration usage data, efficiency, reliability are to be reported. Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html.

The consortium should include EU fuel cell manufacturers, relevant suppliers for BoP components and research institutions or academic groups.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
Following support to development of electrolysers for off-grid applications in AWP2015, this topic will focus on demonstration of integrated fuel cell-based energy storage solutions in off-grid remote areas or isolated micro-grid.
This demonstration must not only raise public awareness; it should be used to establish confidence in technology, business models and market readiness with end-users and authorities of isolated territories.
The project should focus on the following impacts:
Energy independency at the local scale, with maximum recovery of locally available RES;
Reduction of the cost of energy to the final users
Reduction of use of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions
Reduce CAPEX towards 5,000€/kW for fuel cell systems and 2M€/(t/d) for electrolysers following the KPIs of the MAWP
Increase system lifetime of more than 15 years and maintenance interval by new/improved components according the MAWP
Demonstrate a viable solution and a replicable business case
Improvement of energy security and reliability
Supplier and user experience of installation/commissioning, operation and use of fuel cell power generation
To enable generalization of the field experience obtained, benefit from experience worldwide and facilitate technology replication, it is desirable that the selected project could feed into relevant ongoing standardization activities on fuel cells operating in reversing configuration during the duration of the Innovation Action.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU market for temporary and transportable power is increasing due to the general improving economic outlook driving the growth in construction activities, and the increase of social and cultural events (festivals and markets) in urban areas. Diesel gensets are the current status quo in the targeted applications and the societal challenge to be addressed is the reduction of carbon emissions and noise pollution, while achieving higher energy efficiencies in the urban environment. This topic provides a potential ‘doorway’ to the much larger diesel genset replacement market by facilitating fuel cell deployment into “early markets” where diesel genset replacement is reachable due to increasing urban regulations on noise and harmful emissions. The current “clean” alternative is putting connections to the local electricity grid in place. However, due to capacity issues on the grid -most often caused by the charging of electric vehicles- these cables are getting very expensive and/or it is impossible to find the right connection to the grid. The aim of this topic is to demonstrate the technical and business case viability of fuel cells as a disruptive technology capable of replacing transportable diesel gensets and competing clean energy alternatives in the European urban stationary power market in the electrical power range of 25to 400 kW. The specific challenge is providing easy-to-install and easy-to-operate transportable fuel cell solutions - a technology not generally designed to be installed, decommissioned and transported to and from sometimes non-ideal operating environments multiple times during the product life-cycle.
Scope:
This topic focuses on demonstrating robust, transportable, easy-to-install, easy-to-transport FC gensets including feasible fuelling logistics for temporary applications in the power range 25 to 400kW in urban environments. The project has to also include a complete LCA of the concept, including the fuel and logistical costs. The proposals should include at least two manufacturers of FC systems and demonstrate viability in at least two different environments/market segments. Applicants should demonstrate firm commitment from end-users, through conditional orders or direct participation in the consortium during the application phase.
Applicants should demonstrate a total sum of system electrical power capacity of at least 500kW ; a minimum of 4 systems of 75kW or above built in order to follow the construction site power needs through the whole construction cycle and 4 systems in the lower power range, 25kW or above, to address festivals
Applicants should demonstrate robustness and ease-of-installation, through the transport and relocation of individual fuel cell systems and that a cumulative electrical power requirement of at least 750 kW will be served by project end.
Applicants should aim for on-site FC operation for at least 24 months (or 8000 hours). In such a case that the application requirements are less than one year of operation at a particular installation site (festivals, etc.), the applicants should demonstrate the transport and re-use of individual systems at more than one location annually
Applicants should establish a demonstration/commercialisation pathway for European SMEs innovating in the development, manufacturing and supply chain of fuel cell components
Establish the basis and further develop, if possible, marketing and sales strategies of European manufacturers
At project start, system lifetime should be over 15,000 hours and 20,000 hours at project end
System CAPEX target and availability to be achieved by 2023 is 3,500 -6,500€/ kW and >97% respectively (as defined by the MAWP). Development or procurement of auxiliary system components, robust sheltering and refuelling equipment for challenging transportation, harsh work environment, ambient climatic environment and end-user safety is also within the scope of funding if the applicants can demonstrate them to be crucial as well as non-recurring engineering for the targeted market segment
The fuel should be hydrogen which is expected to be stored onsite. The fuel delivery and storage has to be demonstrated as well. Fuel production is not included in this topic, but fuel logistics must be mapped and included while analysing the commercial feasibility of the FC gensets.
TRL start: 6
TRL end: 8
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million per project. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 5 years
Expected Impact:
Demonstrate the safe transport and operation of fuel cell systems, portable/transportable fuel storage and refuelling logistics
Demonstrate the economic viability of each application/ business case selected in the project through real-world TCO analysis
Demonstrate reduced noise and pollutant emissions related to providing temporary power supply in urban applications as well as faster authorisation process for FC gensets (as compared to diesel generators or grid connections) with respect to regulations concerning installations in , specifically noise and pollution, urban areas
KPIs to be demonstrated include system CAPEX of 3,500 -6,500€/ kW, availability over 97% and lifetime over 20,000 hoursHigher visibility of stationary FC and hydrogen technology in the public consciousness through high profile urban demonstrations
A commercial pathway for replacement of diesel gensets with economically feasible, easy-to-install (truck-in and plug-in) power supply in urban areas. A theoretical analysis on viability of FCs as a disruptive ‘diesel genset replacement’ technology post 2020 is highly recommended. This should take into account data collected during the project and a credible analysis of the market situation at project end. This should include but not be limited to H2 cost reductions, improvements in FC lifetime, system and stack component cost reductions, development of alternate fuel/ fuel storage technology, economy-of-scale effect on the supply chain through synergies with large scale FC transport deployments."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The global development of large stationary FC goes towards multi-MW installations: examples are a 15 MW FC park in US or 60 MW FC park in South Korea as well as the announced 360 MW FC park there. Europe has a total of only 2 MW of such fuel cells installed.
Such large installations demonstrate the capability of the technology, raise needed volume for cost reduction and provide best of class total cost of ownership (TCO).
To jump-start this first commercialisation phase, the industry needs dedicated demonstrations with selected promising suppliers/technologies16 in order to clear the way for a volume increase in the market, which is concomitant to the required decrease in capital costs. This should open pathways to allow full commercial deployment with shrinking public funding, taking into account the full added values of what large FCs can offer to the European energy system.
Scope:
This demonstration activity will focus on MW or multi-MW demonstration in order to:
Demonstrate the feasibility (technical and commercial) for MW or multi MW stationary FC’s in a commercial/industrial application, also relative to the use of heat, for which the needed heat recovery equipment is included
Demonstrate the feasibility (technical and commercial) for MW or multi-MW stationary FC in large commercial or industrial applications, also relative to process integration of heat or heat/cold.
Establish confidence for further market deployment actions in other sectors, e.g. next demonstration of MW or multi-MW solutions for grid support
Prepare the ground for successful implementation of European stationary MW-class fuel cell industry (technology and manufacturing settlement) and to achieve further reductions in product cost and development of the value chain
Demonstrate the technical performance as required in a grid with large share of variable renewables.
Core features of the FC such as efficiency, cost, durability and lifetime must comply with relevant MAWP targets and the global competition; these values have been compiled on the expected impact chapter. This demonstration must not only raise public awareness; it should be used to establish confidence in technology, business models and market readiness with key customers in the food, pharma, chemical industry or other sectors. The project should be advanced with market enablers (such as utilities, leading project developers in construction and energy business) to achieve volume contracts and with financiers to assure access to project financing.
The selected project will target primarily demonstration of MW-class FC solutions in the commercial/industrial market segments integrating both of the following:
1 MW up to several MW capacity production of power and heat from methane (natural gas or natural gas quality gas) or hydrogen
Integration of a FC power plant in commercial/industrial processes
The project should aim at creating partnerships between end users, industry, local SMEs, financiers and local authorities, in order to ensure that the solutions are replicable and can be supported or financed by various public or private organizations.
Therefore the project should:
Validate real demonstration units in commercial/industrial applications with adequate visibility so that suppliers, stakeholders and end users may benefit from the experience gained throughout the value chain
Develop and reinforce business plan and service strategy for the specific demonstrated application during the project so that it will be replicable and validated in the chosen market segment after the project

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The European landscape of stationary fuel cells for highly efficient distributed generation has grown richer and more diverse. The industry provides solutions for different use cases in three scales of residential, commercial and industrial applications.
Several European companies provide core component technologies (i.e. stacks, sometimes integrated with the fuel reformer) in ene.field and PACE and have already demonstrated such concepts in larger system designs. Other companies provide already full system solutions demonstrated as prototypes in ongoing FCH2-JU projects. While FC based micro-CHP applications have found their first markets and pick up industrial dynamics, the larger in power commercial applications using the same core technology still need to gain the full trust of system integrators. The validation of the technological performance and reliability and of attractive business cases is key. Large companies in Asia and North America are currently successfully pursuing the development and market entry of fuel cells in the commercial segment. Some of these companies are looking to incorporate next generation European technology. European companies need therefore to validate and demonstrate the successful integration into reliable products now in Europe, ensuring that Europe avoids importing high cost products based on inefficient or poorly matched technologies.
Besides the technical and commercial risks, the integrator industry also shows some reluctance to engage in development as their own investments depend on the core components of SME, as today most stacks are provided by medium size manufacturers that are financially more exposed than large corporations.
This notwithstanding, if FCs are to become economically competitive it is necessary to achieve a substantial reduction in capital costs by increasing production volumes while simultaneously improving the technology behind them. The learning curve needs to be similar to that exhibited by renewable energy technologies.
It is important to leverage the field and demonstration project of the micro-CHP sector to enhance the first achievements of the implementation of fuel cells. The larger production volumes of systems and components need to be translated in further improvements in both cost and quality, and into the validation and demonstration of the technology in further market segments.
Thus further demonstration projects and/or field trials are now required in order to validate the technology at higher power ranges for applications in the commercial building segment.
Scope:
Main scope of this topic is to validate and demonstrate European CHP solutions for the commercial building sector within the specified power range.
Technical: Provide advanced fuel cell based CHP concepts demonstrating the superior advantages of fuel cell based CHP systems by achieving a high level of electrical efficiency (50%+) and an overall efficiency of 90%+ (combined use of heat)
Economical: Demonstrate the customer advantages and viable business models in the aforementioned power range with fuel concepts using the existing high-quality, low-cost gas grid and highly efficient power generation and measure these against previous investigations from the FCH-JU (i.e. “Advancing Europe’s energy systems: Stationary fuel cells in distributed generations” (2015).
European industry: Derive concepts on how to integrate fuel cell core systems into final customer products for the European market by OEMs and system integration companies. Provide common standards and battery limits to make the fuel cell solutions commonly available and thus minimizing the risk to OEMs and system integrators when integrating FC technologies into their products.
Projects within this topic should demonstrate both operation in relevant environments and the route to high availability in significant volumes (10 - 20 installations and 400 - 600 kW installed power).
In addition to the aforementioned targets, projects within this topic shall include some of the following tasks:
Present advanced, innovative concepts that demonstrate the benefits of the use of European FC technologies as part of CHP systems for the commercial sector (e.g. combined heating and cooling (CCHP), integration into critical infrastructures, smart metering and control, other polygenerational concepts).
Validate the expectations on how fuel cell based CHP can improve air quality and reduce CO2 emissions and avoid further emissions (particulate, NOX)
Show how the availability and lifetime required for the abovementioned market segments can be achieved (either by further technological improvements or accompanying service concepts) and how this benefits the expansion of renewables
Define standard interface concepts for FC components and core modules in order to enable non-FC manufacturers to integrate FC generators into their final products using standardized interfaces and battery limits, thus paving the way for new distribution channels.
Design business model [1], installation, maintenance and service concepts for commercial customers.
Develop novel DAQ, monitoring and data analysis concepts and combine them with the latest smart control concepts and products (i.e. support demand-side management).
The consortium should include at least three core fuel cell component suppliers (like stack and reformer) from the European fuel cell industry and in addition to two stakeholders from other areas like
FC system integrators
Relevant suppliers of BoP components (i.e. power electronics, heat exchangers)
Providers of service and maintenance
Utilities or municipal energy suppliers
Research institutions and academic groups may also be included to take a supporting role (i.e. for example as partners responsible for the monitoring of KPIs).
Collaboration with national initiatives is recommended in order to leverage additional funding for the second demonstration step.
Where applicable the topic shall build upon the experience and achievements from earlier projects and further bring about cost reductions by increasing the volume of component (and in particular stack) production and thus improve and strengthen the competitiveness of the European supplier industry.
Projects under this topic shall improve the state of the technology from a TRL at level 5 to level 7.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 7.5 million per project . This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of one project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3-5 years
[1] Building on the back of the latest EU studies (Roland Berger study & current Business Model study)
Expected Impact:
The project shall explicitly strengthen the European value chain for key components:
Stack
Reformer
High-temperature heat exchangers
Further sub-supplied components such as power electronics and desulphurization devices
Proposals need to explain which of these issues can be addressed by raising volumes and in turn improving and strengthening the competitiveness of the European supplier industry.
Other impacts expected will be the
Cost reduction of around 30-50 % compared to current production costs.
Increase in the lifetime of core systems and key components.
Installation and monitoring of 10-20 systems with an overall installed power of 400 – 600 kW depending on the size of the systems in question.
Enhanced supply chain and further synergies with spill-over effects to other applications (i.e. microCHP) that contribute to the success of the entire fuel cell industry.
Improved visibility within the public sphere, and in particular within relevant stakeholder groups in the field of distributed energy (e.g. system integrators, installers and ESCOs).
Further transfer the fuel cell technology into the existing energy industry enabling existing installation and maintenance networks to support FC products.
OEM system integrators committed to the development and deployment of high efficient CHP and CCHP products"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The business case for renewable hydrogen projects is frequently hindered by low utilisation of the equipment. This is caused by the combination of a variable renewable energy supply and a still emerging demand for renewable hydrogen in the mobility sector (e.g. from fuel cell vehicles). Projects are thus often limited to specific niches where non-monetary benefits compensate for idle excess capacity. New business models are therefore required to facilitate the future rollout of hydrogen infrastructure.
The ability to inject hydrogen into the European gas infrastructure via the power-to-gas approach would allow selling surplus hydrogen as a green gas to natural gas distribution networks and reduce the variability on the demand side. This will create a supplementary revenue stream from the gas market, improve electrolyser readiness for providing electricity grid services on demand, and reduce the investment risk by overcoming low plant/HRS utilisation.
The challenge for this topic is to reduce the financial risk of hydrogen supply at a refuelling station by optimising the operating condition of the electrolyser under varying power prices, grid services regimes and changing customer demand, using the low pressure gas distribution network as a hydrogen sink for achieving a secondary income stream, and electricity grid services as a tertiary income stream.
Scope:
This topic calls for assessment and demonstration of an electrolyser and gas network injection equipment at a refuelling station where hydrogen demand for mobility is expected to increase over time. The mobility demand may come from passenger cars, or any other type of hydrogen vehicle including buses, trucks and trains. Although co-location of a station with the gas distribution network is not a conventional siting criterion, it is a pre-requisite for achieving a combined electrolyser-HRS and Power-to-Gas system.
The following equipment could be used for the project and be directly connected at a single site:
A hydrogen refuelling station with a capacity of dispensing at least 200 kg/day that is expected to experience under-utilisation during most (or all) of the demonstration period (demand build-up period);
An electrolyser of at least 600 kg/day generation capacity, with sufficient flexibility to optimise hydrogen production cost as a function of electricity prices, grid balancing activities and gas network feed-in tariffs;
A gas grid admixture and injection system, including the development of appropriate mixing and concentration monitoring technology, which is capable of injecting hydrogen admixtures at flow rates of up to 100% of the electrolyser capacity while maintaining the transient concentration at the grid injection point within specified limits.
It is expected that potential project would:
Create and publish a model that optimises for total cost of ownership the operation of the components above as a function of power prices, grid services payments, hydrogen mobility revenue and hydrogen injection revenue (including injection fee where applicable). Consideration should be given to diurnal and seasonal variations in operating strategy, to the expected transition from low to high numbers of hydrogen vehicles using the station and to any variations in the value of hydrogen to gas networks as they decarbonise. It is important that any costs for the gas network in a regulatory context (e.g. regulatory sandbox) are included in the analysis and the model should consider existing, planned and new stations that are in close proximity to gas distribution pipelines. Preferred operating strategies should be identified by the project, which must be comprehensive enough that others can repeat the work and adopt the identified business models;
Build and operate the equipment to validate the model with real life data, including comparing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the refuelling station without gas grid injection (no CAPEX, OPEX or revenue from the injection system) to that with a grid injection facility. Hydrogen cost targets for stations with and without gas grid injection should be compared for a range of operating variables and rates of HRS deployment across the period 2020-2030. The demonstration should last for at least 2 years, with the expectation that all of the equipment remains in use afterwards. The duration of need for the network injection facility is a key parameter (demand build-up period);
Liaise with the similar topics of this call (topic FCH-02-5-2019: Systematic validation of the ability to inject hydrogen at various admixture level into high-pressure gas networks in operational conditions and topic FCH-04-3-2019: Hydrogen admixtures in natural gas domestic and commercial end uses) to ensure the latest understanding of the impacts of admixtures upon end use equipment and any variations across EU inform the chosen concentration limit and concentration ranges to be applied at the HRS site;
Obtain an exemption from existing regulations and a permit as required from the gas network regulating authority to inject admixtures at the site of the refuelling station. Because flow rates in gas distribution networks tend to be low outside of the heating season, especially overnight, it is important for the system to be able to inject admixtures of up to the highest acceptable concentration if the annual electrolyser utilisation is to be maximised, rather than remain within the limits of existing regulations;
Assess the challenges and propose solutions for injecting hydrogen admixtures into gas distribution networks with respect to: identifying appropriate sites where refuelling stations can feasibly be located close to gas distribution pipelines while ensuring all downstream gas applications are compatible with the admixture concentration under consideration; obtaining any required permits and exemptions; network connection costs and hydrogen concentration measurement at the entry point; and the associated impacts on HRS footprint and site maintenance;
Report any differences with initial assumptions, for example related (but not limited) to electrolyser hydrogen yield, product losses, switching times, injection curtailment due to low gas grid flow rates or transient situations, the primary/secondary/tertiary revenue streams, and the cost and regulatory context for the grid injection equipment;
Provide a conclusion around the impact of hydrogen admixture injection into the gas distribution grid upon the business case of an electrolyser-HRS and identify the cost reduction potential of adding gas grid injection to an electrolyser-HRS.
TRL at start: 6 and TRL at end: 8.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The HRS, electrolyser, gas mixing and injection equipment, and related activities are considered within the scope of the project, while consortium is encouraged to make use of existing infrastructure or equipment where possible and focus on the demonstration, generating and communicating learnings.
“CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be used through the CertifHy platform to ensure that the hydrogen produced, dispensed at the HRS and injected in the natural gas grid is of renewable nature.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 5 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 4 years.
Expected Impact:
The project should deliver substantiated information on the optimisation potential and optimisation schemes for electrolysers at HRS operated on variably priced power and receiving revenues from FCEV refuelling, the gas market thanks to admixture injection, and the delivery of electricity grid services.
Via a validated model, the results should be applicable to different settings where the actual demonstration takes place, for example other EU countries.
It is expected that the project would:
Combine a hydrogen refuelling station and a power-to-gas system compactly at one site using one electrolyser;
Ensure more efficient use of renewable power and increase the amount of renewable gas in the gas grid;
Enable lower cost on-site hydrogen supply from renewable power sources, reducing the hydrogen price at the pump. This would also increase the amount of decentralised hydrogen production and thus decrease distribution requirements;
Provide a blueprint for HRS bankability at initial stages of operation when vehicle concentration is low, facilitating a more economic and faster roll-out of an HRS network across Europe;
Demonstrate efficient sectoral integration between the electricity, gas and mobility sectors;
Improve understanding of the impacts of admixtures upon grid and end use equipment, in collaboration with the other two relevant topics of the call (see above under Scope).

Hydrogen is a flexible energy carrier that can be produced from any energy source, and which can be converted into various energy forms. The main challenges with hydrogen use are related to its storage during large periods of time and capacity, and transportation on long distance. Moreover, due to its low volumetric energy density, hydrogen requires costly steps of compression or liquefaction; while boil-off limits the use of liquid H2 during large scale of time.
Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) based on organic compounds hold the promises for long time and high capacity energy storage, cost-effective long-distance energy transport and, in a long-term perspective, they might be directly used as a fuel for mobile applications. Due to the chemical binding of hydrogen to the liquid carrier, hydrogen can be stored and transported at ambient temperature and pressure in a safe way. Some carrier substances are also fully compatible with existing liquid fuel infrastructure.
Capacities of renewables and electricity costs are extremely heterogeneous in EU. It will not be possible to produce low carbon hydrogen nationally or locally at adequate costs. Just as fossil fuels are being imported and exported across borders today, sites with high renewable potential and low costs of decarbonized electricity should be used for hydrogen production in the long-term perspective. In doing so, storage and transportation of hydrogen at scale is the missing link on the targeted road to a low carbon hydrogen economy. This is where the LOHC approach can play a key role.
Technical feasibility of LOHC has been demonstrated in several projects up to a capacity of 240 kg H2/day. Nevertheless, this technology shows its advantages solely when applied at larger scales. From today’s perspective, the main bottleneck is however its economic viability. In order to overcome this, three routes should be pursued: 1) utilize the economics of scale, 2) optimize the interface to existing large-scale hydrogen generation technologies (e.g. electrolysers, SMR with CCS) and hydrogen consumers (e.g. hydrogen refuelling stations) and 3) redesign of the process technology by merging of sub-components. Central point for all three procedures is the technical and energetic performance of the catalysts.
Scope:
The scope of this topic is to reduce the system costs of the LOHC technology by developing improved catalysts or novel catalytic system architecture. This would allow, among others, the reduction of energy intensity during loading/unloading processes, a higher cycle efficiency and increased lifetime. To reach this scope, three approaches are expected:
Decrease the PGM (Platinum Group Metal) loading, as upscaling of the technology will reduce the specific costs of the unit, but the use of PGM will keep this technology costly. To overcome this, an increase of the catalytic activity in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction or the partial/total substitution of PGM catalyst/critical raw materials is expected to reduce the specific PGM demand;
Increase the catalytic selectivity and specificity as a reduction of the pre- and post-conditioning of hydrogen before and after the hydrogenation / dehydrogenation process can tremendously reduce the costs of the technology. The selectivity of the catalyst for hydrogenation reaction should be adjusted to the properties of the inlet hydrogen stream from electrolyser (or Steam Methane Reformer). In case of dehydrogenation, the used catalyst should be optimized to avoid unwished side-reactions and release hydrogen with a high purity e.g. for fuel cell applications;
Increase space-time-yield by coating surfaces with catalyst as merging the catalyst, the catalyst support and the heat exchanger into one single unit could achieve an increase of efficiency and cost reduction. Concepts involving new component architecture, new materials, and new manufacturing processes should be developed and demonstrated.
It is expected that at least 2 solutions and 3 approaches are proposed by the project.
The topic is open to all kind of LOHC concepts as long as the carrier has the general capability to be used for hydrogen logistics in terms of efficiency, regulatory and safety issues. Substances with low cyclability, high toxicity or low availability should not be considered.
The project should address at least the following key issues:
Evaluation of the catalyst performance compared to state-of-the-art experimentally in a demo unit >10 kW;
Evaluation of the catalyst lifetime and maintenance experimentally in continuous operation of at least 200 h;
Reduction of the energy required in the dehydrogenation to < 6 kWh/kg H2;
Assessment of the catalyst synthesis route regarding the environmental footprint (e.g. with respect to abandoning/elimination of critical raw materials);
Identify the pathways for upscaling of catalyst production and determination of the marginal costs for annual catalyst demand >1,000 t;
Technology comparison with other hydrogen logistic concepts e.g. GH2, LH2, shipping or pipeline, based on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculations and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), avoiding duplications with already funded initiatives or projects i.e. HySTOC [50].
The project consortium should include at least one industrial partner willing to exploit the results.
TRL at start of the project: 2 and TRL at the end of the project: 4.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
The project will be required to contribute towards the activities of the Hydrogen Innovation Challenge (as detailed under point G. International cooperation). Cooperation with non-EU/Associated country member of this challenge is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of eligible countries).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
[50] http://www.hystoc.eu/
Expected Impact:
The improved catalysts and/or novel catalytic structures is expected to open the way for wider impact of LOHC technology. This should be the significant step to provide cost-efficient systems based on LOHC technology that finally will enable upscaling and process intensification. Catalytic improvements (material, integration, comprehension) will also contribute to the development of other technologies (Fuel Cell, Electrolysers) applications.
The expected impact with validated results in a complete LOHC system should include:
Increased technology competitiveness by novel processes/materials/concept with improved techno-economic efficiency while at least maintaining energy demand for dehydrogenation compared to state of the art practice (≤10 kWh/kg H2 thermal energy);
Increased kinetics in dehydrogenation (> 3 g H2/g catalyst/min) by maintaining high grade of conversion (>90%) at high selectivity (>99.8%);
Improved stability/robustness of the system with loss of performances < 0.01%/cycle;
Gravimetric capacity at tank system level >5.0 % wt;
Volumetric energy density >1.6 MWh/m3 (based on LHV H2);
Catalyst compatibility in hydrogenation with H2 from mixed gas streams (impurities up to 20%);
Better catalyst comprehension that will have an interest in fuel cell or electrolysers.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The increase of intermittent renewable electricity raises the need for more flexibility and energy storage in the power market. Falling costs of renewable power open the possibility to generate hydrogen at large scale from renewable power through electrolysis. Several sectors, including refineries, chemical industry, transport, and the natural gas sector are exploring the reduction of their CO2 footprint by incorporating large quantities of renewable hydrogen in their processes.
The challenge is to demonstrate a large-scale electrolyser converting renewable energy into renewable hydrogen for use in an end–market valorising the renewable character of the hydrogen. The electrolyser technology should be at a scale that can modularly be implemented to achieve large capacities (tens of MW), in view of reducing both investment (CAPEX) and operating costs (OPEX). It should be developed to operate flexibly to harvest maximum renewable power and provide grid-balancing services.

The challenges addressed by the project are:
Demonstrating & improving the current state-of-the-art of 10s of MW electrolyser technology by significantly lowering the operating costs; minimizing footprint and addressing scalability;
Provision of large quantities of green hydrogen on a commercial basis for application(s) that valorize(s) the renewable character of the hydrogen;
Demonstration of the working flexibility of the electrolyser on a commercial basis by harvesting renewable power and in the meanwhile offering grid balancing services;
Demonstration of future economic viability of the technology;
Operation of an electrolyser system in real life conditions.
Scope:
The project should aim at demonstrating electrolyser technologies beyond actual state-of-the-art producing hydrogen with favourable economic conditions, e.g. upstream of the point a wind park is connected to the grid, when power prices are low, when additional revenue can be generated by providing high value grid balancing services and where the renewable character of the hydrogen can be valorised.
The scope of the project is:
To develop a new large-scale electrolyser of minimum 20 MW of sufficiently rapid response time (of the order of a few seconds) from hot standby mode. If connected to the grid, the installed power and operating regime should be duly justified to identify the advantages offered to the grid within the long-term business model. The hydrogen purity should meet the hydrogen market requirements. The output pressure shall be designed to fulfil, when possible, the required pressure for the hydrogen application targeted - including buffer storage needs if any - and reduce as far as possible the need for dedicated hydrogen compression units downstream;
To minimize the footprint of the electrolyser with a single balance of plant including all required electrolysis utilities such as water purification, power rectification with appropriate grid interfaces and hydrogen purification, process cooling, etc. for delivery to the proposed application sector. Industrial integration with certification attested by a Notified Body should be foreseen;
The electrolyser should be adapted to the conditions of its operating environment, thus minimizing requirement for operation and maintenance activities;
To demonstrate an energy consumption consistent with 2020 expectations of 52,8 kWh/kg at nominal power;
To demonstrate the economic benefits of the project for the selected application. The consortium should demonstrate revenues from commercial contracts with the chain stakeholders who value the renewable character of the hydrogen;
The proposal should provide the operating scenarios, the expected annual production, the use foreseen and a detailed business case analysis. The electrolyser and downstream systems must be installed and operated for a minimum period of three to four years;
Electrolyser systems will demonstrate a sufficient level of responsiveness to meet the Grid Services requirements;
The proposal must thus include a plan for use of the installation after the project.
It is expected that proposal will address any industrial sector that has not until now been supported by the FCH 2 JU, e.g. use of hydrogen in steel manufacturing or direct replacement of net hydrogen demand in refinery should be excluded. The power connection costs, building costs and the electricity costs for the commissioning phase are eligible for funding. Electricity costs during demonstration / business operation are not eligible. The results of a techno-economic assessment should be reported after each year of operation, including information on the individual cost and revenue streams related to the electrolyser.
TRL at start: 7 and TRL at end: 8.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 11 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
More than one project may be funded for different electrolyser technologies and/or different market applications (industrial sectors).
Expected duration: 5 to 6 years (including minimum 3 to 4 years of demonstration).
Expected Impact:
The proposal is expected to demonstrate in an operational environment improved electrolysis technology at the 10s of MW scale, configured to attract revenues from grid services and/or power price opportunities in addition to the main business of providing bulk renewable hydrogen to an industrial scale hydrogen user.
The consortium will ensure that actions are included in the project to generate learning and reach KPI and commercial targets, such as:
Demonstrating feasible operation of large scale electrolysis and the use of the produced hydrogen in an application valorising the renewable character of the produced hydrogen;
Assessment and operational experience, including safety, of the contractual and hardware arrangements required to distribute and supply hydrogen to the specific industrial and/or transport market;
Perform techno-economic analysis of the performance of these systems;
Technical assessment of the suitability of the electrolyser equipment to operate in its expected environment and suggestion of best practices;
Evaluation of the environmental performance of the system in alignment with the recommendations of the CertifHy project [18] – with attention to the CO2 intensity of the hydrogen produced versus NG route, which should include an understanding of the CO2 impact of the grid services mode selected and CO2 footprint impact in the addressed hydrogen end-user markets;
Projections of the value and size of the markets addressed by provision of the services and supply to multiple hydrogen markets, not excluding the transport sector;
If relevant, assessment and operation experience of the contractual and hardware arrangements required to access the services and operate the electrolyser systems;
Assessment of the legislative and RCS implications of these systems and any issues identified in obtaining consents to operate the system;
Recommendations for policy makers and regulators on measures helping to maximise the value of renewable energy and stimulate the market for renewables-electrolyser systems.
Proposals should describe how learnings will be communicated and dissemination beyond the consortium (upon sanitation to protect business data), including those regions in Europe where large-scale electrolysis has not yet been demonstrated.

","05 May 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Common hydrogen separation systems and technologies are developed for hydrogen rich streams. Recovery of hydrogen from streams with only a low concentration of hydrogen is currently expensive and inefficient, or reduces the pressure of the bulk gas and therefore its value. Separation technologies need to be developed or improved to make recovery of hydrogen from such gas streams economically attractive and energy efficient.
A main application would be the separation of hydrogen from the natural gas grid, thus enabling its use for the storage and distribution of hydrogen. Further applications could be found in separating hydrogen from mixtures produced in chemical or biological processes, where it otherwise would be used to generate heat or even be vented.
This topic calls for proposals to separate hydrogen from the natural gas grid with typical hydrogen concentrations below 10% by volume. Technology proposed for development is preferably also suitable for separation of hydrogen from other gas mixtures. The energy used for separation of hydrogen should not exceed 5 kWh/kg H2 separated.
Scope:
This topic calls for proposals to develop hydrogen separation technology and to validate the system by separating hydrogen from natural gas/hydrogen mixtures. It is expected that the technology readiness level at the end of the project is at least 5, meaning that the function of system has been tested in a relevant environment (for example a resident environment in case the hydrogen is used for a residential fuel cell system, or a refuelling station if fuel cell vehicles are targeted). Validation should be done at least 25% scale for the application (for example above 25 kg/d of hydrogen separated for retail stations). Proposals should justify that the scale of validation is relevant and indicate how the system can be scaled up.
Proposals should further aim to address the economic feasibility of the system by comparing the cost of hydrogen obtained from the separation system with alternative sources of hydrogen, like reformation of a natural gas hydrogen mixture as well as with state of the art separation methods. This analysis should include the full chain and all aspect relevant for the application (examples could be the loss of energy in the NG pipeline or pressure losses for filing stations).
The project should include:
Development of a hydrogen separation technology that can separate hydrogen from gas mixtures below 10% of hydrogen
Validation that the technology can separate hydrogen from natural gas/hydrogen mixtures with the specified hydrogen concentration giving hydrogen quality that can be used for hydrogen operated fuel cells, for example ISO14687 or updates thereof. The system should be in operation for a minimum of 800 hrs and enable extrapolation of findings to full scale and to a lifetime relevant for the application
Cost assessment of hydrogen separation at full scale. As a guideline maximum cost of €1.50/kg of hydrogen separation are expected for full scale application. This would make distribution of hydrogen via the NG grid competitive other ways of distributing hydrogen and would make it economic to separate the hydrogen instead of converting it with the natural gas. Higher expected separation cost would have to be justified in the proposal
Compensation for pressure loss of the hydrogen as well as the bulk gas should be included in the cost analysis if relevant for the application. For example, if the technology removes hydrogen containing gas from the natural gas grid, the cost of recompression and re-injection of the remaining natural gas into the NG grid has to be included
A recommendation for the next steps for the development of the technology
Expected Impact:
The project will show the feasibility of cost (<1.5€/kg) and energy effective (<5 kWh/kg) extraction of hydrogen from very low hydrogen concentration streams, in particular the extraction of hydrogen that has been blended into the natural gas grid at a scale that is relevant for the final application.
The developed technology will provide a route to:
Increase the value of hydrogen blended into the natural gas grid, improving the economics of central hydrogen production from excess renewable energy couples with natural gas grid injection
Reduced cost, and therefore increased use of hydrogen from very dilute hydrogen streams in energy and transport applications"

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Currently most fuel cell systems and key components like stacks, BOP components, system integration, inverter, heat exchanger etc. are produced in small quantities, often with considerable manual input. In order to achieve cost levels allowing for mass deployment, stationary fuel cells need further significant cost reductions in their manufacturing. The currently still low production volumes do not allow identifying, improving and validating all factors that influence the robustness and yield of the manufacturing processes on cell, stack and system level. To reduce costs and increase quality cost effective manufacturing technologies are required for the medium term. This topic focuses on actions to improve production processes and scaled production for stacks, and stack components (cell & cassettes), key components like BOP components, system integration, inverter, heat exchanger etc., and whole systems. The aim is to develop/apply novel manufacturing technologies, including for example: laser welding, coating, 3D printing, molding and casting of materials that are used for fuel cell system components and /or fuel cell stacks.
Scope:
Projects should support development and use best in class manufacturing technologies, production processes, equipment and tooling with cost impact on, for example, stacks, reformers, pre-heaters, BOP and heat exchangers. Optimised production processes for mass manufacturing can include automated assembly, shortened cycle times, continuous production and lean manufacturing with little waste and should be compatible with environmental and health standards. Thus development and adaption of production processes with fewer steps, more tolerant to varying quality of raw materials and with lower-cost materials or materials with reduced environmental or health impacts are important tasks as well as advanced quality control methods.
Innovative manufacturing technologies could also be considered to provide complex design solutions with increased performance while allowing for lower cost levels compared to conventional production technologies.
Pilot plants are excluded.
To achieve cost reduction projects may also aim to develop industry-wide agreements for standard BoP components for FCs, including heat exchangers, reformers, converters, inverters, post-combustors, actuators and sensors. Reaching this target it’s necessary to establish a resilient supply chain with respect of REACH Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006, OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p.1) and other regulations impacting on manufacturing.
Residential (0.3 – 5 kW): start TRL 5, end TRL 8
Commercial (5 – 400 kW): start TRL 4, end TRL 6
Industrial (0.4 – 10 MW): start TRL 4, end TRL 6
Expected Impact:
Projects will enable important players in the fuel cell system segment to implement technologies enabling the step-up from small scale production towards higher volumes. Increased manufacturing capacity by elimination of slow processes and automation of highly manual intensive processing steps will lead to lower manufacturing costs which are the most critical factor towards real market competiveness. Innovative manufacturing technologies could also contribute for cost reduction and reduced time to market.
The project should focus on the following impact:
Confirmation of KPI of the MAWP of at least 97% availability due to implemented quality systems in established production lines, availability shown in relevant environment
Potential cost reduction of key components to achieve overall system CAPEX of
Max. 12,000 €/kW as KPI target for residential micro-CHP for single family homes and small buildings (0.3 - 5 kW, residential) in the MAWP less than 7,500 €/kW for systems of 5-400 kW (commercial)
Less than 3,000 €/kW for the 0.4-10 MW (industrial) segment.
Demonstrate manufacturing flexibility, by allowing reduction of time to market for new concepts by 20-30%, compared to traditional manufacturing lines
and possibly address in addition to that also:
Demonstrate potential for cost reduction of at least 50%, compared to state of the art, once mass production is achieved"

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Common hydrogen purification systems, like membranes and state of art Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) systems split hydrogen into a pure fraction and an impure waste fraction. Current hydrogen generation technologies, like steam methane reforming, combust this waste fraction and use it as a source of heat. New hydrogen production methods or pathways under development often have no heat input requirement so they cannot make use of the waste fraction. These include hydrogen from industrial hydrogen pipelines and underground caverns and low-temperature hydrogen production methods. For these applications, efficient and low cost stand-alone clean-up systems need to be developed and optimized.
Scope:  Scope of work comprises the development and optimization and proof-of-concept of hydrogen purification technologies that achieve the purity requirements for fuel cells used in stationary and transport applications. These systems should be optimised for stand-alone operation with zero or close to zero waste gases, used for purification from the new hydrogen production methods, delivery and storage sources.  
Projects can focus on central large-scale clean-up after production or storage or address smaller scale clean-up just before use of the hydrogen.
The project(s) shall take into account the following overall technology objectives:
•             Low overall energy consumption. This includes energy input, H2 losses and energy required for re-compression to input pressure
•             Low cost (investment and operational cost). The cost of purification is expected to be a small fraction of the final hydrogen cost (ca. 0.15 €/kg)
Expected impact:             Significant technology advance of a stand-alone hydrogen purification system showing:
•             Hydrogen losses below 10%
•             Reduction of CAPEX down to 350k€/ (ton H2/day), with reduction of cost compared to state of art (e.g. palladium or PSA purification)"

The global development of large stationary FC goes towards multi-MW installations: examples are a 15 MW FC park in US or 60 MW FC park in South Korea as well as the announced 360 MW FC park there. Europe has a total of only 2 MW of such fuel cells installed.
Such large installations demonstrate the capability of the technology, raise needed volume for cost reduction and provide best of class total cost of ownership (TCO).
To jump-start this first commercialisation phase, the industry needs dedicated demonstrations with selected promising suppliers/technologies[1] in order to clear the way for a volume increase in the market, which is concomitant to the required decrease in capital costs.
This should open pathways to allow full commercial deployment with shrinking public funding, taking into account the full added values of what large FCs can offer to the European energy system.
Scope:
This demonstration activity will focus on MW or multi-MW demonstration in order to:
Demonstrate the feasibility (technical and commercial) for MW or multi MW stationary FC’s in a commercial/industrial application, also relative to the use of heat, for which the needed heat recovery equipment is included
Demonstrate the feasibility (technical and commercial) for MW or multi-MW stationary FC in large commercial or industrial applications, also relative to process integration of heat or heat/cold
Establish confidence for further market deployment actions in other sectors, e.g. next demonstration of MW or multi-MW solutions for grid support
Prepare the ground for successful implementation of European stationary MW-class fuel cell industry (technology and manufacturing settlement) and to achieve further reductions in product cost and development of the value chain
Core features of the FC such as efficiency, cost, durability and lifetime must comply with relevant MAWP targets and the global competition; these values have been compiled on the expected impact chapter. This demonstration must not only raise public awareness; it should be used to establish confidence in technology, business models and market readiness with key customers in the food, pharma, chemical industry or other sectors. The project should be advanced with market enablers (such as utilities, leading project developers in construction and energy business) to achieve volume contracts and with financiers to assure access to project financing.
The selected project will target primarily demonstration of MW-class FC solutions in the commercial/industrial market segments integrating both of the following:
1 MW up to several MW capacity production of power and heat from methane (natural gas or natural gas quality gas) or power from hydrogen
Integration of a FC power plant in commercial/industrial processes
The project should aim at creating partnerships between end users, industry, local SMEs, financiers and local authorities, in order to ensure that the solutions are replicable and can be supported or financed by various public or private organizations.
Therefore the project should:
Validate real demonstration units in commercial/industrial applications with adequate visibility so that suppliers, stake holders and end users may benefit from the experience gained throughout the value chain
Develop and reinforce business plan and service strategy during the project so that they will be replicable and validated in the chosen market segment after the project

The project should focus on the following impacts:
Reduce the overall energy costs
Building and validating references to build trust among the stakeholders
Reduction of the use of primary energy by
Electrical efficiency > 45%
Total efficiency > 70% (as an example heat cycle: 45°C/30°C, LHV)

Enable active participation of consumers in order to bring the fuel cells technology closer to their daily business
Reduction of the CO2 emissions with respect to the national grid by > 10%
Reduction of the CAPEX (no transport, installation, project management, no heat use equipment) towards < 4,000 €/kW for systems ≥1 MW 3,000-3,500 €/kW for systems ≥ 2 MW
Reduction of the maintenance costs (full service including stack replacement) towards to < 0.05 €/kWh for systems < 2 MW and towards < 0.035 €/kWh for larger systems
Increase the fuel cell system lifetime towards 20 years of operation (stack replacement included, as referred on the cost reduction goals)
Demonstrate a technically and financially viable solution, including the identification of hydrogen sources (if applicable), and a replicable business case

It is a key goal to have the same drivers as those for FCH technologies (reduction of GHG emissions, energy security, distributed generation, local emissions reduction) generated a firm foothold in the societal landscape as well as in the portfolio of investors. Commercial success of FC’s and increasing numbers in the field of distributed generation is needed in order to leverage the awareness and deployment of stationary fuel cell systems. Organic waste processing plants producing methane-rich biogas are highly successful examples of enterprise in the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, of the worldwide biogas plants operational in 2012 (just over 13,000 excluding landfill sites), more than 12,500 are situated in Europe[IEA Bioenergy: “Biomethane – status and factors affecting market development and trade” (2014), http://www.iea-biogas.net[. On the contrary, stationary FC power exploiting this resource coming from wastewater is currently situated almost exclusively in California, US. The fact that such installations are operating well and continuously growing in number proves the feasibility of the concept and outlines a clear opportunity for Europe in particular.
Indeed, direct conversion of biogas from organic waste to end-use power and heat, rather than intermediate upgrading to methane, maximizes round-trip efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the waste-to-energy chain. The aim is to develop fully integrated solutions for bio waste to power. To jump-start the commercial exploitation of these integrated plants, the industry needs dedicated demonstrations with selected promising suppliers/technologies[1].
This should allow to pick up on the growing need for an deployment of efficient organic waste treatment plants, which already provide attractive value propositions in the framework of European legislation.
Scope:
This innovation activity will focus on demonstrating the technical and commercial feasibility of sub-MW stationary FC’s directly fuelled by biogas produced from bio-waste treatment processes, aiming at full process integration of heat use in the digester process or the digestate treatment. In this way confidence shall be established for the further application of FC systems for the exploitation of this resource, which could radically leverage the deployment of stationary FC across Europe, allowing the achievement of further reductions in product cost and development of the value chain.
Core features of the FC such as efficiency, cost, emissions, durability and lifetime must comply with relevant MAWP targets and the global competition; these values have been compiled on the expected impact chapter.
The projects will target primarily demonstration of a sub-MW FC solution in the biogas/-waste market segment addressing the following:
Between 100 kW and 1 MW capacity production of power and heat from bio gas, provided by bio waste treatment processes
Full, steady-state process integration of the FC system with the biogas producing process, in terms of power requirements and heat management
Raw biogas processing and upgrading for durable conversion in the FC stack including the needed clean-up and detection equipment
The scope or the technology should have a clear difference or a clear progress relative to the wastewater project of the AWP2014-2.11.
The project should aim at creating partnerships between end users, industry, local SMEs, financiers and local authorities, in order to ensure that the solutions are replicated and can be financed through various sources. Therefore the project should:
Validate real demonstration units in representative applications in order to enable suppliers, various stake holders and end users to gain experience throughout the value chain
Assess the technical opportunities and bottle-necks across the sector of biogas producing facilities for an accurate mapping of feasibility of the FC integrated system in Europe
Develop and reinforce business plan and service strategy during the project that will be replicable and validated in the chosen market segment after the project
Expected Impact:
This demonstration must not only raise public awareness; it should be used to establish confidence in technology, business models and market readiness with key customers in the food, waste management or other industry accessing biogas from biowaste. The project could be advanced with market enablers (such as utilities, leading project developers in construction and energy business) to achieve volume contracts and with financiers to assure access to project financing.
The project should focus on the following impacts:
Supplier and user experience of installation/commissioning, operation and use of power generation in the bio-waste sector, also relative to tailored biogas cleaning

Reduction of the maintenance costs (full service including stack replacement) of the FC-system (without heat use and biogas clean-up equipment) towards < 0.035 €/kWh (near 1 MW) and towards < 0.050 €/kWh (near 100 kW)

Specific challenge: Obtaining simple fuel cell systems to maintain and compliant with all regulatory requirements is a significant step towards mass markets for technologies that have so far mostly been driven by engineers and scientists. Those features are required to value the large advantages on performances (e.g. electrical efficiency) and to remove obstacles for the commercialization of fuel cells generators and co-generators.
Integrating first lessons from field operation and the conceptual elaboration of lean after-sale structures for fuel cell technologies that differ significantly from incumbent technologies need to be addressed.
Scope:  The main objective of this topic is adaption of the existing FC-based appliances or a core part (stack module, reformer module) by using a Design-to-Service approach, in a way to significantly improve at least 3 of the following 5 objectives:

•             Simplify the service operation in a way that normally trained installers/technicians can accomplish the task by using the appliance “service manual” and the standard tools
•             Reduce the on-site technical intervention time
•             Reduce the total down-time of equipment for servicing

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The roll-out of hydrogen energy applications requires compression of hydrogen at several stages in the supply chain. When centrally produced, the hydrogen will need to be compressed to the pressure it will be stored or distributed. Examples are hydrogen production via electrolysis at 20 bar followed by underground storage at 200 bar or injection into natural gas distribution pipelines close to 100 bar.
For compression of gases reciprocating compressors are commonly used below flow rates of around 1700 m3/hr. At larger flow rates centrifugal compressors are recommended. Centrifugal compressors technology is not optimised for hydrogen, where because of the low molecular weight of hydrogen higher circumferential are required which in turn call upon different materials.
The challenge is to develop reliable as well as cost-effective and energy efficient centrifugal compression technology for hydrogen.
Scope:  The objective of the work is to design and test a centrifugal compression system to compress industrial volumes of hydrogen from 20 up to 500 bar, whereby energy efficiency is increased and cost of ownership reduced compared to state of the art compression systems at this scale and pressure ratio. The system should take into account the properties of hydrogen when selecting materials and operational speed and therefore go beyond the direct adaptation of existing compressors to hydrogen.
The concept must be validated in a relevant environment, i.e. operated using hydrogen and run at full speed at a representative size (minimum mass flow rate of 3,000 kg/hr). It should enable validation of the expected efficiency, durability and cost. The validation should be at least at a single stage level.
The concept must be validated in a relevant environment, i.e. operated using hydrogen and run at full speed at a representative size. It should enable validation of the expected efficiency, durability and cost.
A roadmap for further development of large hydrogen compression systems should be presented.
TRL should meet at least 3 at start of the project and 5 at the end of the project.
Expected impact: The project should enable the further development and future manufacture of large compression systems that are optimised for hydrogen and achieve better efficiency and lower total cost of ownership than existing technology.
The energy consumption of the system should be below 4 kWh / kg H2 when compressed from 20 to 500 bar."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Water electrolysis shows a high potential to produce hydrogen with a very low carbon footprint. Also electrolysers can provide services such as load response management to evolving electricity grids.
Current systems are designed for high efficiency at their operating design point, at typically close to 100% load, and to run continuously. Providing energy services is expected to require start-stop and dynamic operation and high efficiency across much of the load curve. While a number of electrolyser operating strategies can be used to help balance supply and demand, the electrolyser manufacturing industry is still rather uncertain as to which of the requirements will ultimately provide financial income in a future energy market.
Moreover, in order to compete with central steam methane reforming as hydrogen source, electrolysers must both benefit from very low electricity prices as a result of higher volatility, but even more important, to reduce capital cost to a fraction of the current figures, namely -30% in 2020. Proper design of next electrolyser systems, to be commercially available no later than 2020, must focus in developments both in stack design as well as in the balance of plant components and system engineering.
Scope:  Proposals should address the following developments:
•             Identification of the performance specifications required to provide grid services in a broad sense, as potential income sources for an electrolyser operator. Fact based assessment of specifications, supported by experimental evidences (i.e. from existing facilities, especially interaction with the grid and renewable electricity sources), is highly valuable
•             System and component optimization for partial load operation
•             System and component optimization for highly dynamic operation (ramp-up rates, warm start-up, cold start-up, standby behaviour)
•             Control system designed to enhance interaction with the grid and renewable sources
•             System engineering and improvements in manufacturing process for decreasing costs, contributing to system simplification, cost reduction, material use minimisation or that put in place a path to volume manufacturing
•             Characterise and improve understanding of degradation and degradation mechanisms, particularly under dynamic operation
•             Assessment of operation at off-nominal conditions (at higher current density) with regard to CAPEX and OPEX cost and additional revenues (through grid balancing services, fees to make available a power capacity to over-consume renewable electricity on request of the grid operator). The economical optimization shall be identified, depending on the geographies, local regulations and tariffs
Individual improvements in technology should aim at a TRL increase from at least 4 (technology validated in lab) to minimum 5 (technology validated in relevant environment). Real environment should be understood as directly scalable to multi-MW electrolysers.
Expected impact:             Identifying incremental improvements of design addressing central KPIs in 2020, as per the study on “Development of water electrolysis in the European Union ”, as well as adopting innovative approaches in grid and renewable electricity interaction for electrolysers, should be key drivers in projects led by electrolyser manufacturers and technologists. Projects should aim to demonstrate in relevant environments, including fluctuating grid dynamics, incremental applied research already verified at lab scale, in short applied research and innovation cycles paving the way for following projects to full-scale prototyping and even demonstration projects.
Activities will contribute to a faster achievement towards 2020 central KPIs, decreasing electricity consumption to 52 kWh/kg H2 for alkaline electrolysers and 48 kWh/kg H2 for PEM electrolysers, and capital cost to 630 EUR/kW for alkaline electrolysers and 1,000 EUR/kW for PEM electrolysers), whilst allowing electrolysers to a fully integrated operation with renewable sources and grid management services.
Outcome of the projects must derive in components, subsystems, systems and services which can be tested in full scale and operational environment as a next step.
Projects should build upon knowledge and experience from relevant previously funded FCH-JU projects."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Ports/harbours facilities are typically located near cities/residential areas and are negatively affecting the environment, in terms of air and water quality, noise and emissions. To meet regulatory requirements for urban air quality and the establishment of low emission zones within cities increasingly requires that emissions for industrial mobile applications must be addressed in addition to road transport. The environmental footprints from ports that are close to urban centres are high not only due to for the presence of shipping with large diesel engines, but also due to the large numbers of vehicles and cranes that move goods. Emissions from terminal port container operations associated with electric power are estimated to contribute approximately 10% of the total port GHG emissions (CO2) while emission caused by port transport typically accounts for up to 30%, with the remaining majority of emissions caused by to ships' generators. Concerning port operations, rubber tired gantry (RTG) cranes, yard trucks and material handling vehicles dominate fuel consumption. Some projects supporting the deployment of battery electric vehicles or LNG fuelled vehicles have proven effective to reduce fuel consumption and to enhance port operation. With increasing focus on both local and global emissions, zero emission solutions that have a capability exceeding current battery electric propulsion technology or cable reel electric supply [22] are required. For such applications, the suitability and viability of fuel cell technologies should be assessed. Based on this assessment, the most promising solutions should be developed and validated in the field, including logistic solutions for hydrogen refuelling, possibly combining fuel infrastructure with supplies to other local users.
Fuel Cell technologies are able to challenge the autonomy and charging time problems in the short term with the adoption of automotive stacks technologies on board various applications of port vehicles (forklift, rubber cranes, container handlers and so on). The adoption of hydrogen technologies could have an economical advantage inside an integrated port environment that consider at the same time shore mobile applications, on board applications and semi-stationary APU (auxiliary power unit) support systems that may be used for example to provide shore based electrical power to ships in port.

TRL start: 4-5; TRL end: 6-7
The consortium should include a port authority (public entity in general), at least one terminal operator (passenger, container or other) – end user, and a regional or urban authority responsible for air quality in an advisory role.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 4 million per project would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 4 years.
Expected Impact:
Expected impacts of the project include:
Validated FC technology performance in terms of emission reduction (CO2), pollution reduction (SOx, NOx, PM) and techno-economic aspects for port industrial vehicles;
Assessment of the FC technology market potential for port industrial vehicles, cranes and mobile equipment;
Successful introduction of hydrogen technologies in ports and marine sector (new sector);
Increased users' hydrogen acceptance and knowledge;
Industrialization and production ready FC vehicles, cranes and mobile equipment are expected to be defined as an outcome;
Validation and demonstration of system safety strategy and recommendations for the port and marine sector.
The project should provide a significant step towards successful market introduction of FC industrial vehicles inside the port sector, with a significant impact in the reduction of CO2 emissions and air pollution from ports. The project should support the establishment of a European Supply Chain and foster value creation in European industry.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies have been identified as key solutions for a significant reduction of green-house-gas emissions and energy consumption in the European Union. Hydrogen and fuel cells may also play an important role in sector coupling and sectorial integration. Within the context of a market-entry process for hydrogen technologies, the demonstration at large scale of sector coupling and sectorial integration is key to make a significant contribution to decarbonising the current energy system.
Since the beginning of the FCH JU in 2008, mainly individual demonstration projects have successfully shown the maturity and benefits of isolated FCH technologies, such as FCEVs, FC-buses and HRS. It is now necessary to introduce the next logical step towards market introduction, the building up of local and regional H2 value chains and integrated use of FCH technologies across different sectors and applications and so establish a ‘Hydrogen Valley’. A Hydrogen Valley is a defined geographical area, city, region or industrial area where several hydrogen applications are combined together and integrated within an FCH ecosystem. By linking individual projects and developing local H2 infrastructure, establishing H2 Valleys represents the next development stage towards a local H2 economy in the long term.
Sector coupling via hydrogen allows green energy from the electricity sector to be used for the decarbonisation of other sectors such as transport, building or industry by integrating several different hydrogen technologies within this ecosystem. Such an integration helps to simultaneously increase the share of renewables in the local energy mix, while providing power grid balancing. However, it is still not always and everywhere possible to provide sufficient amounts of renewable electricity at reasonable cost. Thus, H2 valley might need to use also hydrogen from fossil sources, such as hydrogen from natural gas reforming, to a certain extent. In that case, methods of producing hydrogen from fossil energy sources without emitting CO2 should be used. Another possibility could be the use of byproduct hydrogen. An increase of the portion of renewable hydrogen, especially from renewable electricity is one of the challenges the projects should find an answer.
Another challenge is the availability and sustainability of the solutions deployed in funded projects. Consortia should substantiate that the installed devices and applications (like FCEVs) will continue to be operated after the end of project funding. As a consequence, the operations are expected to remain economically viable after the end of the funded project, with a goal to continue the operation. The setup of a large-scale hydrogen hub and thus, reach the critical size where renewable hydrogen price and prices for applications can become more competitive is not easy to achieve.
Scope:
The main H2 valley principles to be covered in the project are:
Coverage of entire value chain: establish a complete local H2 ecosystem covering production, storage, distribution, refuelling and final use of H2;
Demonstration of sector coupling: show how the use of H2 can enable sector coupling and in turn help large penetration of variable renewable power;
Different FCH use cases: demonstrate different FCH use cases together in one coherent project;
Integrated approach: link individual sub-projects to each other, show their systemic interaction in a distinct regional or local setup.
A significant portion of the hydrogen used in the project should be produced from renewable sources. The amount of renewable hydrogen can be lower at the start of the project, at least 75% of the volumes produced, but needs to target a level of 100% at the end of the project. The project shall aim at reducing by at least 50% the GHG emissions, as compared with the incumbent technologies [1].
Hydrogen should be produced out of low carbon and/or renewable electricity via electrolysis. Other industrial source and by-product could be also mixed as long as the carbon footprint meets the targets of the project.
“CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be issued and cancelled through the CertifHy platform to ensure that the hydrogen production and consumption is of renewable nature.
At least three FCH applications from at least two different sectors should be part of the project. The following sectors and applications can be considered:
Transport sector: Buses, cars (private cars and / or captive fleets such as taxis), delivery vans and small trucks, medium and heavy-duty trucks (also for long haul trips), specialty vehicles (like garbage trucks and sweepers), trains, waterborne applications (like boats/ships and port logistics), airborne applications (small and medium airplanes, drones and UAVs), material handling vehicles. Other transport applications are not excluded;
Energy sector: Building heat and power, commercial/residential applications using FC-based CHP units, backup-power and electricity supply of critical infrastructure;
Industrial applications: Industrial application valorizing low CO2 hydrogen, like refineries, steel industry, metallurgy, glass industry, ammonia or methanol production.
The volumes produced and distributed for the different applications should be consistent with the amount of investment considered. For the size of the project, it is expected that at least 1,500 tons per year or 5,000 kg/day hydrogen capacity is deployed. Similarly, each application should involve and consume at least 20% of the whole volumes or a minimum of 300 tons per year or 1 ton/day hydrogen.
Elements of already existing projects could be used to support the new H2-valley project, without being accounted as financial leverage of the project; however, it is requested that the coverage of three applications from two sectors should be shown with new installations.
The aim is developing, deploying and demonstrating replicable, balanced and integrated fuel cell and hydrogen-overarching solutions in both energy and transport fields, with the option of providing a hydrogen feedstock for industry through strong partnerships between municipalities, industries and academia. The project should be implemented in EU.
The replicability of the project is fundamental to facilitate further future deployments of H2 Valleys. The proposals should therefore address efforts to provide learnings how to best scale-up and transfer FCH solutions investigated within the H2 valley to other interested areas and regions. This should comprise also RCS issues.
To increase impact beyond the demonstration part of the project, the consortium should develop a long-term vision (roadmap) how to serve all energy needs from H2 and RES based on a local/regional H2 economy until 2050.
The TRL of the applications in the project should be at least 6 at the beginning of the project while the overall concept should target a TRL 8 at the end of the project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 20 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
The consortium is strongly encouraged to identify and secure additional funding sources. Commitment of local authorities (Member States, Regions, Cities) is considered necessary and should be evidenced in the proposal in a form of letter of Interests (LOIs), to be followed by firm commitment before signature of the Grant Agreement. The proposal should therefore include a financing scheme describing the sources of co-funding/co-financing.
Applicants should demonstrate a clear and targeted business model. The funding requested shall be consistent with the economical gap to incumbent technologies.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 6 years with at least 2-3 years of operation per application.
[1]: Incumbent technologies meaning fossil-based solutions widely spread in present economy.
Expected Impact:
Depending on the chosen applications, KPIs for each application should be defined and aligned with the MAWP targets.
The project should address the techno-economic objectives as defined in the Multi Annual Working Plan (MAWP) and in particular:
Showcase the versatility of hydrogen in the frame of the energy transition, the sectorial integration and the Local Hydrogen Economy based on multi and interconnected hydrogen usages within a given geographic area;
Show evidence of the GHG reduction potential of the H2-Valley via a Life Cycle Analysis; Identify the contribution of such concept in the EU 2030 GHG reduction targets;
Boost the introduction of hydrogen hubs based on large electrolysis or other CO2 neutral H2 production technologies, through the development of viable business models which in turn shall drive significantly the future development of FCH markets;
Increase/improve the integration and/or utilisation of renewable energy sources in the region and demonstrate savings by ‘doing with the existing’ infrastructure rather than expensive major upgrades;
Identify potential barriers, including RCS to creating a viable business model for implementing such a Hydrogen Valley across all regions of Europe and recommend possible solutions;
Create close links between all parties (technology providers, owners, operators, end-users, local authorities) with long-term ambitions and strategies;
Develop public awareness and acceptance of hydrogen technologies and create a ground for skills development;
Demonstrate the role of electrolysis for grid balancing services and local energy storage at a meaningful scale for the grid operator;
Show case at an unprecedented scale in EU, the concept of H2-valley and demonstrate the sustainability of the solution and of the business model associated.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Green hydrogen is crucial to meet the CO2 reduction objectives of the industry (e.g. e-chemicals etc.) and in the transportation sector (e.g. fuel cell cars, e-fuels). In this context, the demand of high-quality hydrogen regarding dryness, purity and pressure is steadily increasing. Although conventional methods like mechanical compressors, zeolites, and thermal drying cycles to clean, dry and compress hydrogen are economic and reliable at large scales, they have not been optimised to the scale of decentralised hydrogen production such as electrolysis. Commonly several conventional processing steps are simply put in series in a non-integrated way, resulting in high equipment and maintenance costs, significant energy and limited reliability.
Electrochemical hydrogen pumping for drying, purification and compression presents a radically different approach to fulfil the high-quality requirements of fuel cell applications in various fields, including mobility, Power-to-X and to Power-to-Power. The most advanced technology in this field is based on symmetric high temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane, however only marginal progress has been achieved over the last decade and the commercial maturity is yet to be reached.
Proton conducting Ceramic Cells (PCC) represent a promising alternative way to compress and purify hydrogen. They can extract hydrogen from low pressure levels, low concentrations or mixed with pollutants like CO in a single step to more practical pressure levels and adequate levels of purity. PCCs operate in a temperature range of 400°C – 700°C and allow seamless heat integration options. The use of noble metals is avoided, as these cells are based on inexpensive and abundantly available materials. Therefore, the technology is extremely attractive for an efficient thermal integration when coupled with other chemical processes (e.g. steam biogas reforming, methanation etc.). In combination with reversible Solid Oxide Cells, they open the door to exceed 50% round-trip efficiency for power-to-power applications that can offer a significant contribution to seasonal energy storage. PCCs are however at an early stage of development. The current challenge is to overcome the limited understanding at the materials level and the lack of optimized stack / reactor designs for energetically integrated downstream processing of hydrogen.
Scope:
Based on the challenge of PCC based technologies for efficient green hydrogen processing and handling both in terms of materials, performance, cell and reactor, this topic calls for an integrated approach of material science, reactor design and multiscale modelling. It is expected to reach a significant performance enhancement on materials (increased current density and mechanical integrity, reduced over-potentials), and at the elaboration of a proof of concept reactor design taking into account the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of materials.
Most national and EU projects have focused so far on the development of PCCs for use as fuel cells or electrolysers. Planar cell-based technologies have been investigated in EFFIPRO [66] and METPROCELL [67] projects and tubular cell-based technologies devoted to high-pressure electrolysis in the FCH 2 JU ELECTRA and GAMER projects [68], the latter focusing on 10 kW prototype demonstrations.
The main objective of the topic is to go beyond the above state-of-the-art, arriving to a laboratory scale validation and a PCC technology system operated in different conditions. Among the different testing conditions, mechanical stability, electric conductivity and high proton throughput should be tested in different operation modes.
The project should therefore cover the following aspects:
Qualification of novel materials (electrodes, electrolyte, robust mechanical substrates, sealants, current collectors and interconnects) suitable for stable operation under pressure and purity gradients;
Development of cell or reactor components and included in at least two architectures (e.g. robust composite and/or graded electrodes with high electro-catalytic activities, thin film electrolyte with high crystallinity). The applied manufacturing processes should be industrially scalable;
Multi-scale modelling from the meso-scale up to the single unit level, to enhance the performance of specific materials and to support the development of manufacturing processes towards improved stack / reactor design. The model should be validated by relevant experimental data;
The proposed materials and cells should be implemented in short stacks and/or mini-reactors (with at least 5 repeating units scaled at industrially-relevant size; i.e. 80-100 cm2 per repeat unit). The short stacks and mini reactors should be tested in a configuration allowing pumping of hydrogen, monitoring the hydrogen production, purity and pressure levels;
Insight on the correlation of performance and degradation mechanisms should be gained, including on/off cycles and dynamic operation. This should be the base for designing various PCC electrochemical reactors, enabling process intensification (e.g. shifting chemical equilibria) and electro-synthesis reactors to increase efficiency of overall chemicals and/or green fuel production with low or no CO2 footprint;
A comprehensive assessment of the environmental impact through life cycle assessment, comparing the proposed solution with conventional purification and compression technologies, should be also performed. This should provide a full techno-economical comparison;
As an option, the reversible operation between electrolysis and fuel cell modes in a PCC cell should be considered too;
As another option, the design and validation of a short stack and/or mini reactor in green fuels synthesis (e.g. CO2 reduction, direct electro-synthesis of hydrocarbons) might be included.
The project should bring together the research on proton ceramic conducting materials with the further exploitation of materials of interest for the industry in the next scaling up of the technology.
The consortium should therefore include both academia and industry and should ideally leverage international collaborations. The project should build on existing know-how on cells and stack manufacturing and synergies to other electroceramic processes should be sought.

Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to unlock a path towards commercially viable technology based on PCC technology for dry, pure and pressurized hydrogen extraction from various gaseous streams (any type of electrolysers, biological processes, gasification processes) at a small to medium scale. Single step delivery of pressurized hydrogen will allow efficient integration in the process chain to reduce the overall cost for using hydrogen as energy vector. This will enable the EU players to take a strategic worldwide lead position in PCC technologies.
Insight on the correlation of performance and degradation mechanisms should be gained, including on/off cycles and dynamic operation. This will be the base for designing various PCC electrochemical reactors, enabling process intensification (shifting chemical equilibria) and electro-synthesis reactors to increase efficiency of overall chemicals and/or green fuel production with low or no CO2 footprint.
To leverage the impact of the proposed solutions, following KPIs should therefore reached:
ASR of cells/stacks: < 1 ohmcm2 at 650°C, Faradaic efficiency > 95 %;
Validation of the durability of cells for at least 3,000 hours and validation of short stacks/mini reactors in selected applications for at least 1,000 hours of operation;
Processing of hydrogen with a production loss rate of less than 1.2 %/1,000 hours;
Cell and stack architectures allowing for a pressure ratio across a single membrane (H2 partial pressure increase) of at least 5 and/or cell and stack design extracting hydrogen from concentrations as low as 10 hPa (e.g. 1% H2 admixture in CH4), to offer an economic option for H2 distribution in the existing natural gas infrastructure (reverse step of H2 admixing).
The conditions related to this topic are provided in the chapter 3.3 of the FCH2 JU 2020 Annual Work Plan and in the General Annexes to the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018– 2020 which apply mutatis mutandis.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Islands and island regions are confronted with a number of energy challenges due to their specific geographic and climatic conditions. In addition, islands’ economy is often largely based on tourism, which results in unbalanced seasonal energy demand, which puts a strain on natural resources and infrastructures. At the same time, these challenges represent great opportunities for EU Islands and island communities to showcase innovative solutions for the clean energy transition. Against this backdrop the European Commission, together with 14 Member States, signed the ""Political Declaration on Clean Energy For EU Islands"" [69] under the Maltese Presidency.
Hydrogen and its associated technologies have the potential to support islands in addressing a number of challenges related to energy. Previous years’ initiatives, as Hydrogen Valleys in the FCH 2 JU call 2019, were focused on defined geographical areas where several hydrogen applications were integrated within an FCH ecosystem. Although some experiences with islands and hydrogen technologies exist (e.g. BIG HIT and REMOTE projects [70]), it is necessary to widen the scope to larger community islands as they face particular challenges, including fuel import dependency, high electricity costs, limitations in terms of energy production and energy interconnections, and imbalances on all time scales from minutes to seasons due to tourism relevance.
The development of hydrogen economies in these singular locations will also help boosting the reindustrialization and generating new low carbon economies and sustainable tourism based on green hydrogen as a singular EU flagship initiative.
[69] https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/news/clean-energy-eu-islands-launched-malta
[70] https://www.fch.europa.eu/page/fch-ju-projects
Scope:
The project should cover the following main objectives:
Showcase the ability of hydrogen and its associated technologies to decarbonize islands in EU and worldwide through this renewable hydrogen flagship project. For this reason, the project should be implemented in a location with high communication visibility;
Cover the complete value chain of H2 from production to distribution, storage and end-use in order to decarbonize islands with restricted connections and indigenous energy sources and with significant fluctuations in seasonal energy demand. The proposed solution should provide energy flexibility and improve the island’s system resilience through the use of renewable hydrogen, acting as a buffer;
Demonstrate how hydrogen enables sector coupling and allows large integration of renewable energy on the selected island;
Develop and promote the use of renewable hydrogen, energy efficiency and sectoral integration in applications related to intensive tourism such as hotels infrastructure (e.g. power, heat, cooling), general services, airports, ports, buses, ferries, renting fleets etc.;
Promote the economic growth of EU islands in new technologies and areas (e.g. reindustrialization of remote areas based on hydrogen technologies);
All hydrogen should be produced from renewable energy capacity installed on the island. This hydrogen production should be included in the “CertifHy Green H2” guarantees of origin scheme. “CertifHy Green H2“ guarantees of origin should be issued and cancelled through the CertifHy platform [71] to show that the hydrogen production and consumption is of renewable nature.
The project should therefore cover the following:
Renewable energy integration and green H2 production;
Hydrogen transport, storage and distribution, including the possibility of gas grid injection or other options;
Sector coupling to manage in the most efficient way seasonal energy and H2 production/demand balancing;
Promotion of a renewable H2 ecosystem in the island, as a new economical vector and as mechanism of creating value for the island population.
All final consumption sectors can be considered for the use of renewable hydrogen, with a clear focus on:
Energy sector: Possible applications on heat and power for commercial/residential buildings (e.g. hotels), service sector and industry using FC-based CHP units, fuel cell powered gen-sets, backup-power systems, and electric supply of critical infrastructure. Gas grid injection, in blending mixtures and its impact assessment in order to promote the progressive decarbonisation of the gas grid should also fall under this sector; using renewable H2 as feedstock in industrial applications;
Transport sector: Possible applications of buses, coaches, cars (private/captive fleets), delivery vans, trucks, special vehicles, trains, waterborne and airborne applications, maritime sector or material handling vehicles.
At least two FCH applications from both energy and transport sectors should be part of the project. The volume of renewable hydrogen produced for the different applications should be consistent with the seasonal imbalances in the island and with the amount of investment considered. For the expected size of the project, at least 300 tons H2/year should be produced and consumed on the island As a renewable energy island flagship project, in line with the EU Clean Energy for Islands initiative [72], it is preferable that up to 70% of funding would support the energy sector activities, involving a complete solution of hydrogen generation, storage, distribution and/or energy applications (e.g. power to gas or power to power applications).
Projects are highly encouraged to select island locations that promote the visibility and increase the impact of the hydrogen technologies. Projects based on islands connected to centralized or mainland’s areas are possible too.
The replicability and scalability of the project is fundamental to facilitate further deployments of H2 economies in other islands. The proposals should therefore address efforts to provide learnings on how to best scale-up and transfer FCH solutions investigated within the selected H2 island to other interested areas and islands. For this reason, a clear communication and dissemination strategy and a plan to engage with and foster replication in other islands should be addressed by the project. This should comprise also RCS issues. These activities should be framed and aligned with the European Union Clean energy for EU islands initiative [73] and other similar initiatives supported by EU to accelerate the introduction of clean technologies in islands.
To increase impact beyond the demonstration part of the project, the consortium should develop a long-term vision (roadmap) on the local/regional H2 economy plans on the island towards 2050.
In addition and in view of expected important involvement from industrial stakeholders and/or end-users such as public authorities, consortia are encouraged to identify and secure additional funding sources. Commitment of public authorities (Member States, Regions and Cities) is considered necessary and should be evidenced in the proposal at least in the form of letter of Interests (LOIs). The proposal should therefore include a financing scheme describing the business model, including envisaged sources of co-funding/co-financing and in line with state-aid rules. The funding requested shall be consistent with the economical gap to incumbent technologies.
The TRL of the applications in the project should be at least 6 at the beginning of the project while the overall concept should target a TRL 8 at the end of the project.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu , which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN. A draft safety plan at project level should be provided in the proposal and further updated during project implementation (deliverable to be reviewed by the European Hydrogen Safety Panel (EHSP)).
The project should contribute towards the activities of Mission Innovation - Hydrogen Innovation Challenge. Cooperation with entities from Hydrogen Innovation Challenge member countries, which are neither EU Member States nor Horizon 2020 Associated countries, is encouraged (see chapter 3.3 for the list of countries eligible for funding, and point G. International Cooperation).
The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 10 million. This is an eligibility criterion – proposals requesting FCH 2 JU contributions above this amount will not be evaluated.
Expected duration: 5 years (including at least 2 years of operation per application).

Expected Impact:
Depending on the chosen applications, KPIs should be defined and aligned with the Multi Annual Working Plan (MAWP) 2024 targets [74]. The project should also address the techno-economic objectives as defined in the MAWP and in particular:
Showcase the versatility of hydrogen in the frame of the clean energy transition and as an enabler to sectoral integration within the island geographical area;
Show evidences of the GHG reduction potential in the islands and identify the contribution of such concept in the EU 2030 GHG reduction targets;
Showcase an unprecedented scale of H2 Islands’ concept in the EU, and demonstrate the sustainability of the solutions proposed and of the business model associated;
Demonstrate the replicability of the solutions proposed to other islands in EU and worldwide;
Promote ‘green tourism’ concept by providing green energy supplies and balancing seasonal imbalances;
Develop synergies and promote further development of different hydrogen technologies;
Demonstrate the role of electrolysis for grid balancing and for improving capacity factor of variable RES (sector coupling and sector integration);
Promote and facilitate the re-industrialization of sectors based on high carbon emissions;
Promote progressive decarbonisation of the transport and energy sectors and related infrastructure ;
Identify potential barriers, including RCS to creating a viable business model for implementing such a Hydrogen Island across other islands in EU and recommend possible solutions;
Create close links between all parties ( including technology providers, owners, operators, end-users, local authorities) with long-term ambitions and strategies;
Develop public awareness and acceptance of hydrogen technologies and create a ground for hydrogen specific skills development.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are often described as very promising solutions that will help to reshape a new society model as it would guaranty secure, clean and efficient energy solutions while also offering smart, green and integrated transport solutions. However, transport and energy are often treated separately within the FCH JU funding framework programme, thereby reducing the opportunities to demonstrate pioneer hydrogen economy models at territories levels. 
Therefore, this topic aims to support territories where there is a strong political commitment to deploy ambitious and innovative hydrogen-integrated transport and energy demonstration projects in European Territories.
This particular “Hydrogen territories” topic is focused on the deployment of hydrogen technologies in European isolated territories in order to prove the viability and feasibility of hydrogen economy concept in off-grid areas.
Scope:  To develop and deploy replicable, balanced and integrated fuel cell and hydrogen solutions in both energy and transport fields through strong partnerships between municipalities, industries and academia in European isolated territories disconnected to the main or national electrical grid.
These solutions will demonstrate an integrated hydrogen economy concept focused on small off-grid areas. The hydrogen territory proposals should primarily target transport and energy replicable demonstration applications such as vehicle fleets powered by hydrogen for public and/or private transport, including logistics and/or freight-distribution, MW capacity production of green hydrogen, hydrogen storage for balancing the grid and supply to a hydrogen refuelling station as well as large stationary fuel cell systems for distributed generation and other relevant commercial or industrial applications.
The proposals should address the following main areas:
•             Near/fully autonomous hydrogen buildings/quarters/districts: through the integration of hydrogen energy storage chain coupled with renewable energy sources and including heat valorisation, backup power solution, and when applicable, supply to a vehicle hydrogen refuelling station (retail, public transport, or fleets)
•             Zero emission mobility: through the integration of hydrogen refuelling infrastructures and provision of vehicle fleets powered by hydrogen for public and/or private transport, including logistics and/or freight-distribution. The project shall focus on hydrogen mobility applications such as public transport buses, passenger vehicles, taxi fleets, boats but also scooters or bikes to ensure a greater public visibility and awareness. The vehicles included must be designed in a way that allows producing them in large series
To be eligible, the proposals should prove a strong commitment from local authorities that reveals a long-term hydrogen-integrated urban plan strategy.
Isolated hydrogen territories should seek to create partnerships between industries, academics and cities, demonstrate replicability of the solutions and ensure funding from various sources.
Therefore each project should:
•             Be realised in at least one European isolated territory
•             Include industry, city planning authorities, research community, local Small and Medium Size Companies (SMEs)
•             In addition the project should co-involve at least one follower territory i.e. an off-grid territory willing to contribute to the process though the replication of solutions at the end of the project and having access to the know-how and results of the project and a privileged contact with the project's partners. The involvement of the follower territory should be relevant (e.g. participating in definition of user requirements and methodology of transferability of solutions, data collection etc.).  The follower territory should commit to replicate, improve and follow up integration of hydrogen energy vector solutions in the urban planning. The follower(s) territory(ies) will not be eligible for FCH 2 JU funding to deploy integrated hydrogen and fuel cell solutions in the frame of the project proposals. At least one follower territory should come from a Member State or Associated Country
•             Ensure that all proposed activities will be integrated in an ambitious urban plan. The urban plan shall integrate buildings planning, energy networks, and transport/mobility planning; additional issues may be addressed as well if relevant for the territory. These plans shall be submitted with the proposal as a supporting document(s)
•             In order to ensure the success of the project, the funding for some parts of the programme or initiative in which the isolated territory project is embedded should be secured from other sources, preferably private ones, but also other EU funding sources, national or regional funding
•             Projects should develop and reinforce business plans during the project and Life Cycle Analysis that will be replicable and validated in other territories after the project
•             Consortia must have a clearly defined structure with roles and responsibilities properly spelled out for all involved entities
Proposals must also commit to scientific and technical requirements:
•             Create a “Hydrogen Territory Platform” to share smart hydrogen solution proposals, best practices, project ideas, collect data from operating systems, measurement and disclosure methodology, in order to facilitate a common footprint calculation methodology and other metrics (especially for energy saving; CO2 reductions, financial savings, number of jobs created, environmental impact etc.)
•             The performance monitoring should last for a period of long-term commitment such as 5 years. Consortia should develop an integrated and common protocol for monitoring energy, infrastructure, mobility and governance practices in the hydrogen territories, enabling documentation of improved performance over short and long term periods. The monitoring protocol should be robust and viable also after the end of the project, supporting and increasing municipal capacity over time
Projects should be co-funded by national, regional or private sources in order to demonstrate a strong commitment towards the 2020 European Energy Policy. This should be explained in the budget justification and supported with a Letter of Intent.
Expected impact:             The proposals are expected to have the following impacts:
•             deploy and demonstrate wide-scale, innovative replicable and integrated hydrogen energy solutions in both energy and transport
•             increase the  energy efficiency of isolated territories and valorise the use of renewables for integration of hydrogen-energy solutions and enable active participation of consumers
•             demonstrate the positive impact of electrolysis on grid balancing
•             increase mobility efficiency with lower emissions of pollutants and CO2. The proposals will have to specify key objectives and indicators such as gCO2/km for Well to Wheel analysis
•             reduce the energy costs; The consortium will have to commit itself to reaching targets for energy cost reduction
•             respect Key Performance Indicators described in the MAWP for both hydrogen transport and energy applications and technologies used in the project
•             conclude on a business model for the use of hydrogen in isolated territories
•             decarbonise the energy system while making it more secure and stable; clear targets shall be expressed in terms of, for example, gCO2/MWh electrical and/or g CO2/MWh heat
•             create stronger links between isolated territories in Member States with various geographical and economical positions through active cooperation
It is envisaged that the proposals will also bring societal benefits:
•             Reduction of energy bills for all actors and especially for public authorities with clear objectives for both energy applications (e.g. €/MWh elec and/or heat) and for transport applications (e.g. €/km)
•             Increase quality of life by creating  local jobs (that cannot be delocalised) in the isolated territories
•             Increase air quality
Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html."

","05 May 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
While fuel cell transport applications have recently moved into the early commercialization stage a number of challenges still need to be resolved before hydrogen can be widely implemented as a transportation fuel. These challenges include improved performance and lower costs of both fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and thereby a strengthened customer acceptance. This requires a large scale “market test” with HRS located on a network basis in different regions showing various geographical and demographical characteristics; and with sufficient vehicle numbers, and types, per station to generate relevant data based on demonstration of the HRS under high load conditions. The learnings obtained are specifically intended to trigger further technological improvements of both stations and vehicles and to provide the necessary experience and confidence on the part of investors and policy makers in the business plans for the multi-billion euros of investments needed to establish the HRS infrastructure required for mass market roll-out.
For the purpose of this topic, it is expected that use of electrolysis integrated into fuelling stations will demonstrate a capability to assist the penetration of renewable power in electricity grids by taking excess electricity and converting it into hydrogen. Concurrently, as FCEV fleets increase, the aggregate electrical load constituted by onsite electrolyser based H2 production coupled with HRS facilities could also provide valuable balancing services to the power industry in addition to strengthening the economic case for decentralized electrolysers. A techno-economic framework and control hierarchy is required to ensure appropriate electrolyser-infrastructure is developed for providing balancing services and sufficient low carbon footprint hydrogen is available for FCEV refuelling. Consideration is required of how to design and operate suitable production and refuelling infrastructure, both for wind-dominated and solar-dominated regions, including how central, regional and forecourt electrolysers are operated within the electricity grid. In this topic the focus is on decentralised electrolysis integrated into fuelling stations.
Scope:
This topic calls for a large scale demonstration project covering FCEVs and HRSs, coupled to decentralized electrolysers, to be deployed in alignment with and in cooperation with national or/and regional roll-out activities. Demonstration of electrolyser integrated HRS operating in grid balancing mode in a selection of the new HRS installed will also be covered.
Vehicles
For vehicles, the project will cover the roll-out of a fleet of at least 200 FCEVs. This should comprise multiple OEM supplied passenger cars, utility vehicles (light duty vans, medium duty trucks) and buses. Other vehicles can be included provided they can demonstrate a strong business case a significant market potential (10,000’s per year) and have reached a TRL of 7 or above.
The majority of FCEV's are expected to be using a fuel cell system as the key power source, and 70MPa storage in the case of passenger cars or 35 MPa for buses. Storage systems lower than 70MPa can be allowed if relevant and there is a business and customer case for inclusion in the proposal. Range extenders using FCs are also eligible if relevant and can show a clear advantage over all-electric drivetrains for the same vehicle type.
The minimum operation for passenger cars is 36 months or 45,000 km. For buses it should be 36 months in operational service at minimum 10h/day (unless regulatory restrictions prohibit 10h). The minimum operational period for vehicles introduced in the last 15 months of the project is 12 months or 10,000 km for passenger cars and 12 months or 50,000 km for buses, though in both cases arrangements for extending operation after the end of the project are expected.
HRS
In this topic, the focus is on demonstrating at least 20 HRS in operation and on investigating the specific problems arising from the need to provide high volumes of hydrogen per day while offering satisfactory service to HRS customers in terms of refuelling duration per vehicle (back to back refuelling performance). It is expected that HRS will prove performance under high load. In addition, proposals are expected to address reliability, metering accuracy, purity and station efficiency.
When addressing the passenger car market, HRS facilities need to be accessible for private customers/users and should preferably be integrated in forecourts of conventional refuelling stations. When addressing the utility vehicle market or local fleets, HRS facilities might be located on private forecourts, with or without public access, as long as several customers are already identified as long term users of the HRS. The first HRS need to be operational at the latest 24 months after the start of the project. The majority of the HRS have to be operational no later than 36 months after project start. The minimum operation for the HRS is 5 years (operation beyond the project life is expected.
The project should aim at benchmarking and establishing links between existing regional and national initiatives in order to synchronize actions and maximize impact Europe wide. The demonstration sites for passenger cars, buses, utility vehicles and vans must be located in more than one EU member state where H2 Mobility initiatives, or similar initiatives (like HIT) aiming at deployment of hydrogen based mobility programmes are in place, to leverage the activities already underway. HRS should be sited to provide interconnectivity with existing initiatives to create a plausible driving experience both within and between the networks. In view of the requirement to evaluate HRS under high load, consideration should also be given to locations with a high number of users, addressing both privately owned or fleet vehicles.
Different options for the ownership and investment in HRS should be analysed and tested.
On-site hydrogen production & grid support
The project should demonstrate the use of fluctuating renewable energy sources for hydrogen supplied to the HRS:
Develop a model of the required electrical behaviour of various penetrations of electrolysers and HRS for grid balancing in a range of future scenarios of renewable power penetration and mobility hydrogen demand. The model should provide the most economic favourable scenarios based on a multi-market service strategy
Identify preferred electrolyser and HRS design, including control configurations, for providing the required balancing services and match the local hydrogen demand on the stations and for other applications
Identify operational frameworks (including pooling when needed) for grid operators to utilise electrolysers for balancing services and quantify the associated remuneration. The extent to which electrolysers can assist with meeting energy storage requirements in the EU for the period 2020-2050 should be determined.
Demonstrate cost effective and optimised running strategies for a cluster of electrolysers acting as a single capacity in the energy market. This includes electrolyser load decisions based on electricity cost, electrolyser efficiency at different loads and hydrogen demand at individual stations
The electrolysis technology must demonstrate an electricity consumption below 60 kWh/kgH2 and a capital cost @ rated power including ancillary equipment and commissioning of 6 - 8 M€ / (t/d) for PEM technology and 4 – 6 M€ / (t/d) for alkaline technology
The forecourt electrolysers must demonstrate an optimized integration of the electrolysis with the refuelling station including buffer tanks sizing consistent with the operating modes selected
Safety assessment shall include the social acceptance dimension.
Overall
Measurement, monitoring and evaluation of specific vehicle and fuelling station parameters using methodology such as those used in current projects funded by the FCH JU. The project shall prepare for the use of low-carbon hydrogen and aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the hydrogen refuelled by at least 50% on a well-to wheel basis as compared to new gasoline and diesel vehicles. The results of the CertifHy Project will be taken into account in the analysis of the emissions.
Ensuring that the knowledge acquired throughout the project will help to provide the confidence to underpin future investment and policy decisions in favour of hydrogen vehicles is of key importance. Therefore priority will be given to proposals presenting a comprehensive programme to gather new learning from the project in terms of: customer acceptance, techniques for the operation of a station network, business models for national HRS roll-out, technology performance (and requirements for improvement, using the HyLights methodology) and the impact of different national policies on roll-out effectiveness.
A formal, inclusive and creative dissemination programme is required which ensures that the lessons learnt by the project are made available to wider public. In particular, it should be ensured that countries considering development of similar FCEVs/HRS roll-out initiatives should have an easy access to information generated by the consortium.
Expected Impact:
Vehicles
At least 80% of the vehicles to be deployed in the project should be “next” generation and based on model platforms made available / released in Europe after 1st January 2015). A number of older vehicle models can be accepted where these are introduced in the early stage of the project to help improve HRS loading levels.
Technical targets for passenger cars:
>6,000h vehicle operation lifetime
The key power source of vehicles must be a fuel cell system (except for light duty vans, medium duty trucks and other vehicles proposed based on a range extender concept or optimized combinations of hybrid drives)
Vehicle range > 400 km
Fuel cell system MTBF >1,000 km
Availability >98% (to be measured against available operational time)
Tank-to-wheel efficiency >42%, measured in the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC)
Pilot series production ability has to be shown
Technical targets for buses:
>15,000h / 2 x 8,000h[1] vehicle operation lifetime initially, minimum 20,000h lifetime as program target
The key power source of vehicles must be a fuel cell system
Fuel cell system MTBF >2,500 km
Availability >90% (to be measured in available operation time)
Tank-to-wheel efficiency >42%, for buses measured in the SORT 1 & 2 drive cycles.
Pilot series production ability has to be shown
Utility vehicles (light duty vans and medium duty trucks) and other vehicles must demonstrate that their specifications meet the requirements of a mainstream customer for the vehicle type included. They should also demonstrate that the vehicles will have reached a TRL of 7 or above by the time of deployment in the project.
For vehicles deployed early in the project the funding contribution will not exceed 500 € per kW of installed power in passenger cars and other vehicles where the fuel cell is the key power source, and will not exceed 2000 € per kW where the fuel cell acts as a range extender. For buses, the funding per vehicle cannot exceed 3500 € per kW of installed power. For vehicles deployed 3 years after project commencement and to reflect cost reductions brought by new vehicles the funding contribution will not exceed 200 € per kW for passenger cars, 1800/750 €/kW[2] for buses and 700 €/kW for FC-range extenders (limited to 30 kW). Overall, a minimum of 80% of the FCEVs funded will be at the lower of the funding contribution levels indicated.
HRS
Assessment of progress towards overcoming the barriers to the roll-out of FCEVs (it is expected that substantial advances in comparison to the state-of-the-art to five of nine of the issues below will be proposed and trialled in the project):
Metering of hydrogen: As current standard dispensing technology is offering a level of metering accuracy of circa 5%, improvements leading to a level of accuracy reaching circa 1% should be considered
Quality Assurance issues around hydrogen purity: Progress towards definition of an industry acceptable hydrogen quality compliance system is targeted
Integration of hydrogen into conventional vehicle fuel forecourts: 2 options for integrating HRS are to be considered: semi-integration with separate hydrogen dispensing unit from the main conventional fuels distribution versus full integration within the existing distribution system
Achieving a high level of availability for HRS: Improvements towards 98% HRS availability
Optimization of HRS layout and reduction of safety distances for HRS integrated in service-stations
Improved efficiency/performance for HRS:
level of back to back vehicle performance to be defined as function of HRS utilization factor (minimum of 5 for passenger cars / LDVs)
energy consumption targeted at 4kW/kg H2
optimization of compressor management
optimization of cold temperature process management
Key RCS issues for HRS such as those related to optimized safety distances and fuelling protocol to be addressed in order to facilitate permitting/approval
Standard Operation procedures for refuelling
Increased availability of hydrogen from renewable sources: level of targeted decarbonization of the hydrogen fuel must be defined according to the national/regional sustainable on-going production roadmap(s)
Furthermore, HRS are expected to comply with the following requirements:
For passenger cars, provide a clear and configured HRS network, with practical FCEV driving distances between HRS (in the order of 200 km). For utility vehicles based on the captive fleet model, a realistic fleet of vehicles (up to 30 per station) must be demonstrated together with a vision of how the business model for these HRS installations will lead to their integration into a wider, publically accessible, HRS network for multiple vehicle types
For buses, HRS be designed to allow for supply to a realistically scaled bus fleet of up to 20 buses for cost effective HRS operation. Both passenger car and bus categories should comply with the requirements of the directive on the deployment of alternative fuel infrastructure package (as published particularly as regards its standardization requirements. Exceptions may be allowed, if justified by the vehicle application (e.g. the captive fleet model for utility vehicles)
The majority of the HRS for non-fleet, public operation shall deliver 70MPa H2 for private cars and 35 MPa for buses and should be sized consistently with the deployment and business planning strategy for the country / H2Mobility programme HRS targets. Higher capacity HRS facilities are encouraged for highly frequented HRS sites. The minimum refuelling capacity should be 200 kg of daily refuelling capacity for all stations. Moveable or mobile stations can be proposed, adding flexibility and reliability in regional clusters comprising several fuelling stations
Some 35MPa HRS (maximum 10) can also be proposed if they are associated with a significant fleet of vehicles (passenger cars, vans, other vehicles, buses) TRL 7 or above) and can demonstrate a clear commercial plan. In this case, an up-grade strategy to 70MPa, or a bi-pressure station (35MPa and 70MPa) should be proposed if coherent with the foreseen customer(s) requirement(s) ideally before the end of the project and consistent with the business case for the station
A target availability of the station of 98% (measured in usable operation time of the whole filling equipment) should be adopted and bidders should demonstrate how this will be achieved
The cost of dispensed hydrogen offered in the project needs to be consistent with the national or regional strategy on hydrogen pricing. Cost improvements due to increased hydrogen production capacity and especially higher utilization rates of the HRS is anticipated in the course of the project (target at the pump <10€/kg excl. taxes)
Hydrogen purity has to be at least 99.999 %. Vehicle refuelling process must comply with SAE J2601 (2014) and IR communication needs to comply with SAE J 2799. Exceptions may be allowed, if justified by the application
Reliability of filling process under high throughput situations, i.e. 6 vehicles being filled in 1 hour
An average maximum funding per HRS is 700,000 €, excluding electrolysis.
On-site hydrogen production & grid support
Deployment of at least four electrolysers operated as a single system to demonstrate on-site production of hydrogen, while providing services to the electricity transmission and/or electricity distribution network operators. A central electrolyser may be included as part of this system, but terminal and distribution facilities from the central electrolyser to the hydrogen customer cannot be funded under this topic The choice shall take into account the following parameters:
For the forecourt electrolysers priority is set to the HRS with the highest forecasted demand of hydrogen (e.g. bus depots)
need to pool several electrolyser systems for grid services
Linking existing or otherwise funded electrolysers to this system is encouraged.
Total installed capacity of electrolysis funded by this project at least 1 MW (with at least 50% of the capacity in decentralised mode).
Confirm and validate feasible operation of distributed electrolysis on the HRS, including the necessary grid interfaces that capture revenue from grid balancing and (or) energy storage services
Optimise a system containing forecourt and central electrolysers to provide electricity grid services while producing hydrogen. Storage options at the HRS should also be envisaged.
The environmental performance of the system shall be foreseen including an understanding of the GHG emission impact of the grid services mode selected and mobility WTW (well to wheels) roundtrip efficiency and WTW CO2 emission assessment. Demonstration of how the 50% reduction of carbon intensity targeted is met
Confirm that there is a viable business model for electrolysis to deliver hydrogen at the dispenser at a maximum price of 10€/kg
Overall
The proposal should identify:
Customer profiles in order to establish HRS utilization patterns in an early market
Definition of best practices for mass market roll-out
Analysis of network planning decisions and in particular the customer reaction to the network, with a view to influencing future network planning activities
The learning from the project will be widely disseminated to improve the overall investor/policy maker confidence in the infrastructure roll-out and support other actors in the hydrogen mobility sector in evaluating their strategies. It should address the following points:
The techno-economics of the HRS facilities and vehicles deployed in the project vs. the targets identified in the national or regional roll-out strategies as well as the MAWP
Customer acceptance and the willingness of local populations to switch to FC vehicles when a minimum HRS coverage is in place
Determination of any new obstacles on the way to hydrogen mobility, particularly from a customer perspective
Customer profiles in order to establish likely early adopters and HRS utilization patterns in an early market

Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are often described as very promising solutions that will help to reshape a new society model as it would guaranty secure, clean and efficient energy solutions while also offering smart, green and integrated transport solutions. However, transport and energy are often treated separately within the FCH JU funding framework programme, thereby reducing the opportunities to demonstrate pioneer hydrogen economy models at territories levels.
Therefore, this topic aims to support territories where there is a strong political commitment to deploy ambitious and innovative hydrogen-integrated transport and energy demonstration projects in European Territories.
This particular “Hydrogen territories” topic is focused on the deployment of hydrogen technologies in European isolated territories in order to prove the viability and feasibility of hydrogen economy concept in off-grid areas.
Scope:
To develop and deploy replicable, balanced and integrated fuel cell and hydrogen solutions in both energy and transport fields through strong partnerships between municipalities, industries and academia in European isolated territories disconnected to the main or national electrical grid.
These solutions will demonstrate an integrated hydrogen economy concept focused on small off-grid areas. The hydrogen territory proposals should primarily target transport and energy replicable demonstration applications such as vehicle fleets powered by hydrogen for public and/or private transport, including logistics and/or freight-distribution, MW capacity production of green hydrogen, hydrogen storage for balancing the grid and supply to a hydrogen refuelling station as well as large stationary fuel cell systems for distributed generation and other relevant commercial or industrial applications.
The proposals should address the following main areas:
Near/fully autonomous hydrogen buildings/quarters/districts: through the integration of hydrogen energy storage chain coupled with renewable energy sources and including heat valorisation, backup power solution, and when applicable, supply to a vehicle hydrogen refuelling station (retail, public transport, or fleets)
Zero emission mobility: through the integration of hydrogen refuelling infrastructures and provision of vehicle fleets powered by hydrogen for public and/or private transport, including logistics and/or freight-distribution. The project shall focus on hydrogen mobility applications such as public transport buses, passenger vehicles, taxi fleets, boats but also scooters or bikes to ensure a greater public visibility and awareness. The vehicles included must be designed in a way that allows producing them in large series
To be eligible, the proposals should prove a strong commitment from local authorities that reveals a long-term hydrogen-integrated urban plan strategy.
Isolated hydrogen territories should seek to create partnerships between industries, academics and cities, demonstrate replicability of the solutions and ensure funding from various sources.
Therefore each project should:
Be realised in at least one European isolated territory
Include industry, city planning authorities, research community, local Small and Medium Size Companies (SMEs)
In addition the project should co-involve at least one follower territory i.e. an off-grid territory willing to contribute to the process though the replication of solutions at the end of the project and having access to the know-how and results of the project and a privileged contact with the project's partners. The involvement of the follower territory should be relevant (e.g. participating in definition of user requirements and methodology of transferability of solutions, data collection etc.). The follower territory should commit to replicate, improve and follow up integration of hydrogen energy vector solutions in the urban planning. The follower(s) territory(ies) will not be eligible for FCH 2 JU funding to deploy integrated hydrogen and fuel cell solutions in the frame of the project proposals. At least one follower territory should come from a Member State or Associated Country
Ensure that all proposed activities will be integrated in an ambitious urban plan. The urban plan shall integrate buildings planning, energy networks, and transport/mobility planning; additional issues may be addressed as well if relevant for the territory. These plans shall be submitted with the proposal as a supporting document(s)
In order to ensure the success of the project, the funding for some parts of the programme or initiative in which the isolated territory project is embedded should be secured from other sources, preferably private ones, but also other EU funding sources, national or regional funding
Projects should develop and reinforce business plans during the project and Life Cycle Analysis that will be replicable and validated in other territories after the project
Consortia must have a clearly defined structure with roles and responsibilities properly spelled out for all involved entities
Proposals must also commit to scientific and technical requirements:
Create a “Hydrogen Territory Platform” to share smart hydrogen solution proposals, best practices, project ideas, collect data from operating systems, measurement and disclosure methodology, in order to facilitate a common footprint calculation methodology and other metrics (especially for energy saving; CO2 reductions, financial savings, number of jobs created, environmental impact etc.)
The performance monitoring should last for a period of long-term commitment such as 5 years. Consortia should develop an integrated and common protocol for monitoring energy, infrastructure, mobility and governance practices in the hydrogen territories, enabling documentation of improved performance over short and long term periods. The monitoring protocol should be robust and viable also after the end of the project, supporting and increasing municipal capacity over time
Projects should be co-funded by national, regional or private sources in order to demonstrate a strong commitment towards the 2020 European Energy Policy. This should be explained in the budget justification and supported with a Letter of Intent.
Expected Impact:
The proposals are expected to have the following impacts:
deploy and demonstrate wide-scale, innovative replicable and integrated hydrogen energy solutions in both energy and transport
increase the energy efficiency of isolated territories and valorise the use of renewables for integration of hydrogen-energy solutions and enable active participation of consumers
demonstrate the positive impact of electrolysis on grid balancing
increase mobility efficiency with lower emissions of pollutants and CO2. The proposals will have to specify key objectives and indicators such as gCO2/km for Well to Wheel analysis
reduce the energy costs; The consortium will have to commit itself to reaching targets for energy cost reduction
respect Key Performance Indicators described in the MAWP for both hydrogen transport and energy applications and technologies used in the project
conclude on a business model for the use of hydrogen in isolated territories
decarbonise the energy system while making it more secure and stable; clear targets shall be expressed in terms of, for example, gCO2/MWh electrical and/or g CO2/MWh heat
create stronger links between isolated territories in Member States with various geographical and economical positions through active cooperation
It is envisaged that the proposals will also bring societal benefits:
Reduction of energy bills for all actors and especially for public authorities with clear objectives for both energy applications (e.g. €/MWh elec and/or heat) and for transport applications (e.g. €/km)
Increase quality of life by creating local jobs (that cannot be delocalised) in the isolated territories
Increase air quality
Any event (accidents, incidents, near misses) that may occur during the project execution shall be reported into the European reference database HIAD (Hydrogen Incident and Accident Database) at https://odin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/engineering-databases.html."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The composition of hydrogen delivered to fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) has a significant impact on fuel cell stack durability and system efficiency. International standards dealing with hydrogen quality specifications have been created (ISO 14687-2:2012 and ISO 14687-3:2014) and the former is currently under revision (ISO TC 197/WG 27&28).
The contaminants included in these standards are primarily associated with hydrogen production and purification processes. European and international research efforts have been contributing to better understanding of the effects of such contaminants (e.g. CO, HCHO, HCOOH) and their maximum acceptable levels are already relatively well understood. Nevertheless, most of these investigations are conducted using individual contaminants under static operation conditions, at relatively low maximum current density (1 A cm-2), and not necessarily with MEA configurations appropriate for future automotive applications.
Furthermore, contaminants originating from hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) may also impact the quality of hydrogen delivered to FCEVs. The effects of irreversible contaminants (sulphur, halogenates such as tetrachlorohexafluorobutane, contaminants from ionic compression, etc.) as well as those arising from HRS operation and maintenance are less well known. A major issue with some of these contaminants (e.g. grease from compressors) is that relatively large amounts of contaminant can be introduced into the hydrogen due to improper maintenance procedures or component failure.
Scope:
The main focus of the project should be to understand the effect of contaminants originating from the hydrogen supply chain, as specified in current standards ISO 14687-2:2012 and ISO 14687-3:2014, on fuel cell performance and durability under dynamic load cycle conditions. MEA configurations representative of state-of-the-art transport applications shall be utilised.
A particular challenge concerns the identification and characterisation of contaminants originating from the HRS (TRL 8) and their impact on fuel cell performance and durability.
Based on the results, mitigation methods (e.g. in-line monitoring of hydrogen quality at HRS) should be developed and appropriate revision of ISO 14687-2:2012 proposed. A major focus should be on avoiding the use of ‘total’ parameters where possible. The work will also support revision of ISO 14687-3:2014.
Tolerance levels for impurities depend on the fuel utilisation and load profile of the PEMFC. Therefore, the susceptibility to contaminants should be characterised at PEMFC system level, using realistic automotive conditions and drive cycles, including frequent voltage and start-stop cycling as well as very high maximum current densities (2.5 A cm-2). The susceptibility to contaminants should be characterised using representative fuel utilisation rates, including enrichment of contaminants in the anode recirculation loop. Ultra-low anode PGM loadings (0.02 mg cm-2 or less) should be included to support minimising use of PGM and provide information for future revisions of ISO 14687 standards.
The project should address the following key issues:
Evaluate the impact of contaminants, including relevant mixtures of contaminants, based on risk analysis of hydrogen supply chain, under automotive operation conditions, using MEA configurations appropriate for future automotive applications.
Identify the critical components and maintenance practices in the HRS that can, in addition to other common sources, introduce contaminants into the hydrogen fuel.
Provide technical data on fuel composition and impurity concentrations at HRS, focusing on impurities originating from HRS components and maintenance practices.
Set up the basics to establish practically a European Laboratory beyond the project, capable of measuring all of the contaminants in the current ISO standards (14687-2:2012 and 14687-3:2014).
Develop and characterise existing and novel methods for in-line monitoring of hydrogen quality at HRS for the most critical impurities identified.
Build on existing knowledge through extensive use of results achieved in previous and on-going European projects as well as international networking and exchange.
Study the short term (reversible) and long term (irreversible) effects of the identified critical impurities in a way that is representative of automotive PEMFC system operation (e.g. high fuel utilisation, start-up/shut-down cycling).
Through risk analysis (production process) and fuel cell durability tests, identify the key impurities that can be measured instead of performing ‘total’ measurements as specified in ISO 14687 and recommend revision of the standard to ISO TC 197.
Measure accumulation of contaminants in the anode recirculation loop or at the anode gas outlet; accumulation of contaminants in purged anode water; cross-over of contaminants to the cathode through the membrane, and vice versa; conversion of contaminants in the anode recirculation loop including the effect of oxygen permeating from the cathode.
Communicate the results and their relevance in an effective way to ISO TC 197/WG 27&28, as well as other standard drafting organisations, enabling specification of an independent and comprehensive revised hydrogen fuel impurity matrix.
The proposal should establish a link to the FCH2-JU project HyCoRA, in order to ensure complementarity and adequate take-up of its outputs, including the utilisation and further development of the qualitative and quantitative risk assessment approach of the HyCoRA project.
The subject addressed in this topic has been identified as a priority by many countries working on hydrogen and fuel cells. Collaboration with relevant international partners is recommended.
A collaboration mechanism needs to be developed with the JRC, in relation to the ongoing EU protocol harmonisation and validation activities performed in support of the FCH2-JU programme.
All deliverables and data should be public in order to support standardisation work as effectively as possible. Data anonymisation should be avoided.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu).
The FCH2-JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years
Expected Impact:
The proposed developments will improve understanding of contaminant effects, and thus present an important base for appropriate future hydrogen standards. This understanding will also support the discussion of ""hydrogen quality requirements vs affordable hydrogen costs"".
Successful development and application of in-line continuous monitoring of hydrogen impurities would reduce the incidence of poor vehicle performance and potential loss of reputation of fuel cell technology.
The expected impacts of the project include:
Identification of critical impurities originating from HRS components and operation/maintenance practices.
Technical data for impurity concentrations at HRS nozzle with focus on impurities from HRS components and operation/maintenance practices.
Develop and set the basics for the possibility to establish the laboratory beyond the project, capable of measuring all of the contaminants in the current ISO standards (14687-2:2012 and 14687-3:2014) in order to offer this service to the European FCH community.
Recommendations for revision of ISO standards, under consideration of dynamic operating conditions, continuous full power operation (2.5 A cm-2) and future MEA configurations with anode PGM loadings of 0.02 mg cm-2 or less.
Recommendations for revision of ISO standards concerning HRS components, commissioning and maintenance practices.
Recommendations for revision of ISO standards for contaminants introduced by HRS components and operation and operation/maintenance practices.
Recommendations for revision of ISO 14687 to allow compliance testing against hydrogen purity specifications to be more achievable.
Improved and/or new methods for in-line continuous monitoring of hydrogen impurities in HRS, with a focus on CO measurement.
Recommendations on the concept of an on-board hydrogen purifier.

It is a long standing finding of the research community that hydrogen behaves very benign in free environment. Confinement and congestion, however, promote more severe accidental consequences. The Network of Excellence (NoE) project HySafe derived from this the strong need for improving the principal understanding of and the development of validated risk assessment tools for the accidental behaviour of hydrogen in tunnels and summarised the state-of-the-art in the HyTunnel study [23]. Facing the intended accelerated deployment of hydrogen powered mobility on one side and the steadily increasing part of traffic infrastructure, which is established in tunnels or in similar confined spaces on the other side, will urge any new standard or regulation for transport systems to address also the specific safety issues involved with this new alternative fuel in tunnels and similarly confined space, like underground parking etc. Serious fires in some road tunnels in the Alpine countries during the years 1999 and 2001 triggered the issuing of the European tunnel safety directive 2004/54/EC [24]. National implementations of this directive are due by 2019 [25]. Neither this directive nor any other international regulation, codes or standards, e.g. PIARC 1999 [26] or NFPA 502 [27], provide specific guidance for evaluating the appropriateness of conventional mitigation technology (ventilation, water spray or fog, foams, etc.), conventional safety management and established first responders strategies in case of a tunnel accident with an hydrogen vehicle or hydrogen transport involved. The referred methodologies (FMEA, CFD, etc.) are rather generic and lack validated models for evaluating the effectiveness of the quite expensive tunnel equipment.
Therefore, the aforementioned European regulation related to tunnel safety and safe efficient supply of the alternative fuel hydrogen (AFI Directive) and the related safety assessments urgently require a sound scientific basis and a better understanding underpinned by experimentally generated validation data. Obvious knowledge gaps concerning the interaction of hydrogen dispersion and in particular combustion with existing safety installations have to be filled with pre-normative research, relying equally on experimental proofs and numerical extrapolations. The generated knowledge and tools should be translated to similar scenarios, including railway tunnels and underground or multi-storey car parking.

Scope:
The scope of the proposed project shall be confined to traffic infrastructures, in particular tunnels according to the implementation of EU directive 2004/54/EC and the effectiveness and interaction of conventional and innovative safety measures in case of accidents with hydrogen-powered vehicles or hydrogen transport in tunnels. For providing guidance and suitable performance based requirements to regulatory bodies, technology suppliers and operators, an experimental program shall be designed and executed to analyse the interaction of hydrogen, its mixing and combustion behaviour, with conventional extinguishing agents, such as water sprays, water fogs, and foams, to investigate the influence on and effectiveness of ventilation and concerned ventilation strategies, to test the functionality and effectiveness of conventional safety installations and measures and if necessary to provide additional requirements for technical improvements regarding specific prevention and innovative mitigation techniques. The potential accumulation of hydrogen in air ventilation ducts, apertures and chambers and the specific hazards imposed by late ignitions and subsequent explosions shall be taken into consideration. Beyond that, the project shall also address the opportunity to support with the new data the validation of already existing models and quantitative risk assessment tools Thereby the results of the project will be available not only for safety evaluations of tunnels systems but also for similar confined traffic infrastructures like parking garages etc.. It will make the safety assessments more robust and potentially reduce costly over-conservatism. The analysis should also provide suitable data and information to instruct first responders for revision and improvement of their intervention strategies as well as of the general accident management. So the project activities should encompass:
Review of the current knowledge (state of the art) concerning safety in confined traffic infrastructures (especially tunnels) and its underpinning experiments as well as situation related to RCS in Europe;
Definition, characterisation and delimitation of EU tunnels as well as confined spaces in subcategories pertaining to the relevance of hydrogen vehicles and transportation (e.g. by length, cross section, ventilation rate, traffic throughout, hydrogen present per km, existing fire management facilities etc.) to aim on detailed understanding of fire and safety issues by category;
Identification and prioritisation of relevant knowledge gaps and scientific results (data) compared to the scope above;
Definition and realisation of necessary experiments, to investigate the interaction of hydrogen and hydrogen flames with conventional mitigation systems and strategies to prove effectiveness of conventional safety measures and/or deviate mitigation techniques and concepts;
Identification and evaluation of innovative safety strategies and engineering solutions to prevent and mitigate potential accidents with hydrogen powered vehicles in confined infrastructure with an initial focus on tunnels;
Check, and in case develop further intervention strategies and tactics for first responders providing conditions for their life safety at an accident scene and to maximise property protection;
Derive guideline for the proper use of mitigation systems and draft recommendations for standards developing organisations (SDOs);
Establish communication channels with other research communities worldwide and involved international SDOs for the sustainable implementation of the project outcomes;
Collaboration with FCH 2 JU safety panel and identified experts worldwide.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2018""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.

The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 2.5 million per project would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
Unique experimental data concerning the interaction of hydrogen with tunnel safety equipment and the special geometries of confined infrastructures will be available;
Deeper knowledge of the relevant physics will provide better hydrogen safety engineering to underpin the development of innovative prevention and mitigation strategies;
Experimental data to support further development and validation of relevant physics models, simulation and risk assessment tools;
Recommendations for prevention and mitigation concepts for inherently safer use of hydrogen vehicles and safer transport of hydrogen in tunnels, and other confined infrastructures, such as underground parking;
Analysis of effectiveness of conventional safety measures in tunnels and other confined infrastructures like underground garages etc.;
Potential reduction of over-conservatism and increased efficiency of installed safety equipment will save costs;
More appropriate intervention strategies and tactics for first responders to tackle potential accidents with hydrogen powered vehicles in tunnels and underground parking etc. will protect life of first responders, people and property;
Commonly agreed, scientifically based recommendations for the update of relevant RCS will lead to a more harmonised normative landscape and level up the safety culture in general;

Professional knowledge and skills are needed by first and second responders [1] to tackle situations involving hydrogen systems and infrastructure. This is essential to inform their participation in the initial permitting process, improving resilience and preparedness through enhanced emergency planning, and ensuring appropriate accident management and recovery. Providing technically accurate and up to date hydrogen safety information to responders is essential to underpin inherently safer deployment of hydrogen technologies and its public acceptance.
The foundations to training of first responders have been already laid by the HyResponse project [2] which has established the first European Hydrogen Safety Training Platform (EHSTP) to train first responders through threefold comprehensive training: educational training with the state-of-the-art knowledge in hydrogen safety, including tools for characterisation of hazards and associated risks from hydrogen applications, operational training on mock-up real scale transport and hydrogen stationary installations, and innovative virtual reality training reproducing the entire accident scenarios, intervention strategies and tactics, including the whole chain of command and communications between all members of the first responders team, facility managers, and public.
The uniqueness and importance of EHSTP and its European Emergency Response Guide (EERG) has been validated by the feedback from EU, USA and Japanese firefighters and experts in hydrogen safety. It is now important to capitalise upon the HyResponse investment and draw on wider experience by engaging further stakeholders both across EU and beyond. The establishment of pan-European integrated training resources is however a challenge. This would require consistent and continuous approach across regions, whilst accounting for local level projects, national level requirements, and languages. A ‘train the trainer’ approach will assist in meeting this challenge but first an appropriate network should be established.

Training of responders has been identified as a priority beyond EU with programmes, for example, in the USA. The experience gained globally should be analysed and utilised through efficient collaboration with EU and global/international organisations in areas of hydrogen safety, emergency and rescue services, emergency planning, etc.
Projects should seek to:
Establish a pan-European network of trainers for first and second responders, supported by stakeholders from EU and beyond, to facilitate dissemination of knowledge and experience generated within the HyResponse project and relevant follow-up projects from EU to national level;
Update and expand the threefold training programme of EHSTP, through further development of emergency scenarios to reflect the latest state of the art (e.g. develop intervention strategies and tactics for liquid hydrogen (LH2) applications, tools for assessment of hazards and risks for LH2);
Create tailored local training allowing for local language, country specific national regulations and established practices, simplifying and facilitating local approval of hydrogen projects, improving further safety of first responders at the accident scene, etc;
Educate and train tomorrow’s responder trainers through established and regularly updated comprehensive educational, operational and virtual reality training. These trainers should replicate this European hydrogen safety training in their own country and in their own language to facilitate and improve efficiency of the local training process, to underpin the introduction of the technology and its public acceptance;
Integrate this hydrogen safety training into broader national training programmes where available, e.g. through the provision of emergency response training for hydrogen-powered vehicles along training for other electrical vehicles, LPG and CNG vehicles, etc;
Establish an International Forum of First Responders in Hydrogen Safety Training to facilitate sharing of best practice globally;
Establish links with ongoing FCH 2 JU projects, e.g. sharing of training materials through educational platform(s) to maximise outreach, dissemination and impact;
Establish stronger links between first responders’ activities and FCH 2 JU research and educational projects; Valuing the responders' experience and their feedback to enrich and harmonise harm criteria, models for hazards and risk assessment from the point of view of hydrogen system designers, expand communications to other stakeholders, including but not limited to legislators, technology experts, insurance companies, etc to underpin a massive and inherently safer deployment of hydrogen systems and infrastructure.
The consortium should include fire service institution(s), partner(s) experienced in application of virtual reality for training of fire and rescue services, academic partner(s) specialising in research-led education and training in the field of hydrogen safety, representative(s) of hydrogen industry. Stakeholder(s) beyond past HyResponse project should be now part of the consortium. Participation of non-EU stakeholders should be sought, e.g. through an Advisory Board engagement.
It is expected that the project will contribute towards the objectives and activities of the Hydrogen Innovation Challenge (as detailed under section 3.2.G. International cooperation). Promoting international collaboration beyond EU Member States and H2020 Associated Countries is therefore strongly encouraged.
Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) dedicated mailbox JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu, which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD and the Hydrogen Event and Lessons LEarNed database, HELLEN.
Test activities should collaborate and use the protocols developed by the JRC Harmonisation Roadmap (see section 3.2.B ""Collaboration with JRC – Rolling Plan 2019""), in order to benchmark performance of components and allow for comparison across different projects.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution of EUR 1 million would allow the specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected duration: 3 years.
Expected Impact:
First and second responders will have educational background to permit/approve hydrogen projects at a local level and will be stronger integrated into hydrogen safety community to underpin the activities in deployment of hydrogen systems and infrastructure;
Emergency planning and preparedness relating to hydrogen technologies and infrastructure will be enhanced;
Risk of incidents/accidents relating to hydrogen infrastructure will be reduced through improved knowledge and training of first and second responders with at least a training session in 10 EU countries;
Pan-European Network of Responder Trainers should be founded for at least 10 EU countries;
Coherent up-to-date training programmes for responders will be available in at least 7 different languages;
Translated educational materials will be available to all stakeholders, e.g. through the NET-Tools Educational Platform;
European cadres of trained first responder trainers will be available including new tools for assessment of hazard and associated risks for first responders from hydrogen-powered transport and stationary applications;
Updated European Emergency Response Guide, including intervention strategies and tactics for LH2 applications, will be available online for all responders;
Finally, an International Forum of Responders in Hydrogen Safety Training should be founded.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Current industry practice for the distribution of gaseous hydrogen from central production plants is by means of trailers equipped with approximately 200 bar compressed gas storage cylinders. The maximum effective payload of these trailers is around 400 kg.
The FCH 2 JU aims to fund development and demonstration projects to increase the payload to 1000 kg, while keeping cost and unloading time acceptable. The aim is to reduce distribution cost, reduce the number of distribution trucks on the road and minimize the impact of delivery at hydrogen retail stations, thus enabling road transport of hydrogen on a larger scale than is currently possible.
The recently completed DeliverHy project concluded that the MAWP target for high pressure trucks (1000kg capacity at investment cost of 450 €/kg in 2023) is feasible. Further conclusions were that improvements are needed for filling the truck and for emptying it at the hydrogen retail station; as well as to standards (EN/ISO on cylinder design) and regulations (ADR for transport of dangerous goods by road).
This topic calls for proposals to enable high pressure hydrogen delivery by proposing changes to regulations and the interfaces between the truck and hydrogen supplying and receiving equipment. The proposal should describe activities to obtain acceptance by hydrogen retailers and distributors as well as regulators. It is possible that the results of the project will be used in a future full scale demonstration project.
Scope:
Projects should focus on industry agreement on standard equipment (connections, pipe-diameters, etc.) and procedures for loading and off-loading trucks and aim at bringing standardised high-pressure (≥450bar) hydrogen trailer delivery from TRL level 3 to TRL level 7. Projects should start with a review of the public conclusions of the DeliverHy project. The project should include:
Building of a consortium with sufficient critical mass to enable standardisation of equipment and procedures to load and unload high pressure gas trucks
Stakeholders include hydrogen suppliers, hydrogen retailers and standardisation/regulation bodies. These are encouraged to participate in the project, but could also participate in other forms for example as advisors or steering committee members
Define standard equipment and procedures for the interfaces between the high pressure truck and the truck filling station and the high pressure truck and the hydrogen retail station
Design and build, or adapt an existing high capacity trailer on a relevant scale with the interfaces defined before
The volume and weight of the system should be on the same scale so that it is clear that full system would meet EU trucking regulations regarding these
The system pressure should be at the full intended (optimum) pressure and at least 450bar
The capacity of the system should be at least 200kg
Integrate as far as possible technologies and tank components (liner, mechanical reinforcement, valves…) used for on board hydrogen tank for transportation in order to optimize the production process and lower production cost. Size effect will have to be taken into consideration
Design and adapt the interface to a hydrogen retail station to receive hydrogen at high speed according to the standards defined; and optionally: design and build or adapt a high pressure hydrogen truck filling station according to the standards defined (otherwise find an alternative way to fill the truck)
Demonstration of trailer delivery at a filling station using the agreed equipment and procedures“. Data (filling times, hydrogen losses, incidents and other relevant aspects) from at least 10 deliveries should be documented and published
A cost analysis of the trailer when produced at full scale as well as the cost impact on the hydrogen terminal and filling stations of transitioning to high pressure trailers
Initiation of the process to certify high-pressure trucks for operation on European roads
Expected Impact:
Industry agreement on the interfaces between high pressure hydrogen trucks and truck filling points as well as hydrogen refuelling stations regarding equipment and procedures has been obtained and published
The agreed interface equipment and procedures have been demonstrated at relevant scale and in a relevant operating environment and results have been published
The process to amend EU legislation to allow high pressure hydrogen trucks on the road has been initiated and a pathway to certification of high-pressure, high-capacity trucks is visible
The feasibility of the 2023 cost (≤450€/kg) and capacity (≥1000kg) targets have been validated or changes have been proposed based on adequate reasoning.
Offloading time has been optimised within safety constraints to allow as fast as possible offloading at the filling station. A minimum target is ≤60min for 200 kg, but consortia are expected to aim for quicker offloading."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Education and training in the fuel cells and hydrogen sector is critical for the current and future workforce and thereby supports indirectly the commercialisation of the technology. Knowledgeable and capable workforce that understands the functioning of both technology and underlying fundamental processes, but knows also about obstacles and technological restrictions, is essential for successful development, planning and implementation of FCH plant and system technology. Apart from conventional education and training methods, education and training on FCH technology and its fundamental processes should turn towards digital based e-education and e-training methods, which become more and more used fruitful and successful in modern education methods. In addition, e-science practised by modelling and simulation of very different technological problems and issues is increasing over the past years and knowledge, and results originated by modelling and simulation are available via digital means and should be transferred to be used for education and training on FCH technologies. An envisaged challenge is the presentation of conventional technological content through modern information technology concepts, serviceable for higher education (undergraduate and graduate students) in case of educating engineers but also focusing on industry, especially SMEs, to educate and train permanent employees, or by self-study through new e-education methods and concepts.
Scope:
The scope on this topic encompasses the development of new digital based methods to educate and train undergraduate and graduate students but also technical workforce on FCH technologies and fundamental processes behind. The e-learning concept shall include new methods based on figurative language and representations to explain detailed physical and mathematical principles and FCH technique in its complex structure. Opportunities to support conventional student lessons shall be included as well as concepts for successful self-studies.
The needed IT-structure shall be built on a web-based e-learning platform backed by open access software, and shall provide free access as a minimum during project lifetime. As several e-learning platforms, databases and digital education material already exist, the e-learning platform shall link others and include comprehensive information on educational and scientific activities in FCH-thematic area to profit from. In addition, user interfaces shall be envisaged to expand the e-learning platform also to e-science, e.g. through modelling and simulation of fundamental processes but also process modelling and simulation of technological and safety aspects. International collaboration with similar activities ongoing in US, Canada and Asia will be an advantage and can strengthen the whole FCH community.
The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected duration: 3 years
A maximum of 1 project may be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
Development of new digital based methods and concepts to educate and train engineers and technicians on FCH technologies
Inclusion of figurative language and representations to support and/or explain detailed physical and mathematical principles behind the technologies (e.g. thermodynamics of hydrogen behaviour, electrochemical behaviour of fuel cells)
Inclusion of digital opportunities to transpose self-study on FCH technologies on different levels
Inclusion of virtual practicing measures to educate and motivate candidates, e.g. e-learning by doing (e.g. through virtual practicing and simple demonstration tools)
Interconnections with already existing e-learning platforms and digital training materials (e.g. digital lessons scripts, digital training materials, databases to specific data)
Provision of freely accessible e-learning platform (e.g. web-based) implementing education and training methods and concepts developed based on open access software
Provision of tools to maintain and update e-learning platform
Development of a business model and structure to ensure that the e-learning platform remains a valuable asset and continues to grow after the initial project(s) is/are completed
Supporting FCH industry by e-education and e-training of permanent staff in general
Strengthen the community by building networks for educational and informational reasons

","Research and Innovation action
","25 March 2014
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Extensive research has been undertaken in recent years to enhance support to those involved in detecting and countering explosive threats. This research should propose innovative approaches to develop methods/technologies able to fill existing gaps or greatly improve already existing along the terrorist timeline, including:
 Intelligence techniques to spot those preparing for an attack;
 The inhibition of well-known precursors;
 Detecting specific chemicals, and/or bomb factories and/or the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in transit, and in particular in a flow of vehicles / people;
 Neutralizing the IED and undertaking forensic and evidential work.
 Furthermore, a substantial amount of research and development has been carried out for other purposes, that could be applied to efforts to counter IEDs and Home-Made Explosives (HMEs). For instance, federated sensors are being developed to detect air/water pollution in sewages, streets and buildings.
But up to now, no comprehensive research was undertaken to assess the effectiveness, the efficiency and the cost of all the developed methods/techniques (including those initially designed for a different purpose). Detecting an explosive threat inside a flow of vehicles or passengers (including carried bags) also remains a major challenge at the present day.
 Scope: Proposals should address the full time line of a terrorist explosive plot. At each period of the time line, the project should assess the effectiveness of the supporting method/technology used to counter the threat at that period using credible scenarios based on real cases, including the evaluation of the most effective integration and association of existing technologies along the timeline.
Scenarios should take into account the type of explosive (e.g. home-made, conventional) and the means of transit and deployment (e.g. person-borne, vehicle-borne, left baggage), as both of these factors will have an influence on how effective a given combination of methods/technologies will be.
On detection in transit, projects should focus on the optimal combination of several existing technologies, for example spectroscopic stand-off detection; active/passive imaging for hidden objects detection; dogs (or other animals); automated CCTV tracking; multi-sensor data treatment. It should also cover the best way to locate sensors, taking into account realistic operational conditions and past event scenarios. In addition, technologies should be identified to fill detection gaps, such as e.g. bio-inspired technologies, stand-off-eye-safe spectroscopy, tomography, radar imaging, polarimetry etc.
In addition, the proposal should identify the weakness of the current defences on IED and the best candidates to make them better.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between €3m and €5m would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact:
- Better understanding of the effectiveness of the supporting method/technology used to counter the terrorist use of an explosive threat.
- Allowing those involved in counter-terrorist activities (e.g. Law Enforcement Agencies, bomb disposal units, Security & Intelligence Agencies, and Government Laboratories) to make proper choices in the application of new tools and technologies.
- Better understanding of the combination of technologies required to detect and locate an explosive threat inside a flow, providing security and police forces with enough information so that they are able to take quick and effective decisions.
- Contribution to a considerable improvement in the field of public security.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The past 10 years have seen a wider and wider uptake of GNSS based user technology, initially with the Personal Navigation Devices in our cars and then with smartphones in our pockets. Nowadays this also includes tablets, laptops, cameras, fitness gears and wearable devices, etc. In addition, recent trends are showing that not only “every person” but in the future also “everything” will be connected and equipped with a GNSS device (e.g. connected vehicles and internet of things). This is opening a new generation of Location Based Services (LBS). The development of this new generation of LBS is driven by different needs, depending on the application: mobility, productivity, safety, etc. To satisfy these needs, the key requirements for GNSS are Time-To-First-Fix (TTFF), accuracy and availability. Galileo satellites will further improve signal availability, thus enhancing continuity of service for LBS in urban or challenging environments. By contributing to multi-constellation solutions, Galileo can satisfy the need for higher accuracy and fast TTFF of demanding applications.
The specific challenge of this topic is to exploit the availability of GNSS enabled mass market devices, developing innovative EGNSS applications that will:
Foster the adoption of EGNOS and Galileo in mass markets and ensure that the benefits will be captured by the users.
Create applications that will make best use of EGNSS innovative features such as better multipath resistance, authentication etc.
Contribute to the competitiveness of the European GNSS industry in the area of mobile applications, with special focus on the innovative role of SMEs.
Maximise public benefits by supporting the development of applications that will address major societal challenges in focus areas such as health, citizen safety, mobility, smart cities, sustainable resources monitoring and management, regional growth, low-carbon energy infrastructure planning and protection, climate action.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at developing new innovative applications, with commercial impact and a clear market uptake perspective. Below are some areas which are identified as especially promising for further EGNSS applications development:
Mobility as a service and Smart Cities: Development of EGNSS solutions for cross-modal mobility and new emerging “mobility as a service” approach should be addressed, in which the user does not buy a vehicle or a public transport ticket, but a service to comply with her/his mobility needs. This area may include innovative telematics applications in which the positioning, timing and navigation are used both to deliver the mobility service and to calculate a fair price based on the actual use of it. Development of EGNSS solutions for other areas of future Smart Cities are also included in the scope.
Internet of things: Development of EGNSS solutions for “internet of things” should be addressed, exploiting the interconnectivity of uniquely identifiable devices and the availability of their location. Proposals should duly reflect the fact that the internet of things is not only improving productivity and efficiency of organisations (with applications in almost every sector of the economy, from automotive to consumer electronics, healthcare or manufacturing and logistics), but that the internet of things technology is also changing our daily lives.
Commercial and social LBS: Proposals should address one of the two following application areas. 1) Applications for commercial LBS, such as: secure financial transactions; mobile workforce management, tracking solutions; augmented reality; social networking and sport. 2) Applications for social LBS, such as: safety and emergency (E112), e-health (health services more and more connected), and solutions supporting visual and mobility of impaired people.
For all the mass market areas, the development and innovation should build on:
Galileo features that improve performances in urban environment ;
Multi-constellation, fusion with other positioning techniques, including sensor fusion and innovative network fusion techniques;
Authentication services that will be provided by Galileo; and
Techniques to optimise power consumption.
Attention should be paid to socio-economic considerations such as consumer needs, consumer behaviour (including early adopters), lifestyles, as well due consideration should be given to applicable legal frameworks and ethical issues such as privacy and data protection.
EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies is required to make the application(s) work, this is not excluded from the scope.
In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope of this action.
The Commission considers that one proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities should aim at developing highly innovative and adaptive applications taking advantage of the Galileo and EGNOS added value. The proposal shall have a clear intention to commercialise the products and services developed, including a business plan. The consumer chipset and devices manufacturers (e.g. for smartphones and tablets) are mainly produced in non-European countries and the expected impact of this topic is to foster the competitiveness of European GNSS application providers that build innovation on these chipsets and devices, contributing to increase the overall EU competitiveness in the mass market. In addition, considering that the EU has a good market share of machine to machine chipset and module providers, the expected impact is also to foster applications building on this capacity."

Specific challenge: Although Galileo is a European programme, it has a strong international dimension. International cooperation in the field of Galileo-enabled applications is therefore an essential element facilitating its breakthrough to new and emerging markets and strengthening Europe's position as a major space player.
Scope: Activities under this topic will enable the development of innovative applications within international context and related standards with high international impact, ensuring that the EGNSS services are well known and can be used throughout the world. The objective is to support new proposals consisting of demonstrators of applications, adaptations of applications to a specific and local context outside of the European Union and the implementation of applications benefiting from multiple constellations, including Galileo. GNSS should be used as the primary positioning technology in the application and positioning should be a key enabler of the application. Third countries will be guided and supported in adapting services and developing applications corresponding to local needs and ensure that no unnecessary restriction to the use of the EGNSS is applied. Focus will be on regions of the world, which represent an attractive market for the European industry.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals are expected to foster application development through international cooperation and create a broad acceptance of EGNSS in non-European countries. The consortium should aim to transform the research results into innovation in third countries, through the networking of relevant technology developers with local academia, incubators, SMEs, representatives from civil society as well as local authorities, notably for the provision of public services, best practices and technology through the establishment of self-sustainable partnerships and collaborative initiatives.
Release of practical tools to the GNSS developer community, ideally with free open source license, is of particular interest.

","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Range limitation, due to the limited storage capacity of electric batteries, is one of the major drawbacks of electric vehicles. The main challenge will be to achieve a systematic energy management of the vehicle based on the integration of components and sub-systems. The problem is worsened by the need to use part of the storage capacity in order to feed auxiliary equipment such as climate control. In extreme conditions up to 50% of the batteries' capacity is absorbed by these systems. The systematic management of energy in electric vehicles is a means to gain extended range without sacrificing comfort. The challenge is therefore to extend the range of electric vehicles in all weather conditions.
Scope: Proposals should address the combination of the following developments: comprehensive thermal management system (including thermal insulation, innovative heating and cooling approaches), battery life duration enhancement as a side effect of thermal management, electronic control of energy and power flows, energy efficiency of electrified accessories, energy harvesting functions and automated and eco-driving strategies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 8 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research and innovation activities will contribute to a faster introduction of electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Cars autonomy will be increased thanks to a reduction of at least 50% of energy used for passenger comfort and at least 30% for component cooling in extreme conditions with reference to electric vehicles currently on the market.

Specific challenge: The challenge is to reach the fleet level of 95g CO2/km and 147g CO2/km emissions targets for passenger cars and light duty commercial vehicles respectively (according to the new Worldwide harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure), through the development of advanced engine and after-treatment concepts adapted and optimised to use natural gas. Significant reductions in terms of real driving emissions of NOx and PM are also expected.
The technology needs to be competitive with respect to current vehicles using conventional fuels. Therefore the challenge can only be reached if vehicles demonstrate a driving range of at least 600 km with no space penalty in comparison to gasoline vehicles.
Scope: Proposals should focus on any combination of combustion process optimisation, variable compression, control systems, dual fuel operation, optimised fuel injection, adaptive systems and sensors to cope with different qualities and blends, after-treatment systems, advanced fuel tanks, ancillaries and overall powertrain optimisation.

","ERA-NET Cofund
","15 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
At present, the first generation of electric vehicles have proven their potential although there is still scope for future improvement. So while research and the development of electric vehicle technology has progressed well, the integration of new technologies in the existing transport system still requires substantial effort, mainly in urban areas. The sound deployment of electric mobility in European cities and the realisation of a certain degree of alignment require the involvement of stakeholders at national, regional and even local authority level, who are in charge of the legislative and regulatory framework. Integrated with, but not overlapping, the European Green Vehicles Initiative, the ERA-NET Cofund represents a new dimension of Public Private Partnership. It ensures that the complementary approaches and means of national and regional authorities are appropriately included and receptive to research achievement from the industrial sector.
A European approach is essential to realise the ambition of effectively bringing electric mobility to the market: it allows key players to come together on a transnational scale; it helps to identify and to tackle the barriers holding back the introduction of innovative urban electrification products and services in the single market. Implementation of electrification needs to be increasingly based on partnerships that build the necessary scale and scope, and achieve greater impact from scarce public and private resources.
Scope:
The proposed scope of the ERA-NET Cofund on Electric Urban Mobility reflects the progress that was made in previous years and consequently sets a specific focus on urban areas, where the next important steps in the innovation cycle will take place. Proposals will aim at the innovation and deployment needs for 2020 and the years after. Activities should focus on demonstrating and validating solutions that have already reached sufficient maturity for deployment. These should be complementary to, and not duplicate the scope of, the other projects of the European Green Car and European Green Vehicle Initiatives. Appropriate user and general public acceptance, regulatory, market up-take, social, environmental and resource efficiency aspects should be included. In principle all modes of surface transport are relevant. Urban freight and logistics is in scope (e.g. smart urban delivery fleets), but the focus will rather be on passenger transport (e.g. car sharing with EVs).
The proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national and regional research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Call content should take into account the European Green Vehicles Initiative to ensure no duplication of funding.
Participation of legal entities from international partner countries is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding[1] may nonetheless request a Union contribution to cover the coordination costs of additional activities on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost.
To adequately address this specific challenge and generate a substantial impact, a call volume of EUR 30 million is considered to be appropriate (including a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million).
Nota bene: Budgets should be determined in consultation with the respective initiatives to balance ambition in achieving critical mass and absorption capacity as well as aligning financial planning between MS and the EU.
Expected Impact:
This action will result in:
―Acceleration of the time to market of affordable, cost-effective and socially acceptable solutions to integrate electric mobility in Europe's urban transport systems.
―Reduction of the environmental footprint and the energy payback time.
―Strengthening the industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.
―Tangible and practical guidance to the decision makers in the relevant authorities and support industry as well as the service sector to provide suitable and feasible solutions for electric mobility in European urban areas.
―Contribution to climate action and sustainable development objectives.

","04 October 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The objective of the topic is to support the future development of a production base for next generation Lithium battery cells or post-lithium battery cells in Europe that would be able to compete with present world leaders of the sector. World leaders have started producing batteries and cells of the lithium-ion family since the nineties for mass consumer electronics such as personal computers and mobile phones, giving them the opportunity to acquire experience in mass production, optimize their technologies and create product diversification. Europe is strong in providing the raw electrochemical materials and the production equipment, however experience and knowledge on production at mass scale is missing. Small scale production of lithium cells is taking place for niche applications, but lack of mass markets such as consumer electronics makes mass production for automotive applications unlikely due to high entry barriers but also to less performing electrochemical formulations.
To develop its production base, Europe should develop more competitive chemistries and start-up-scaling production lines and progressively acquire the necessary knowledge and experience to further optimise battery technology.
At the same time, Li-ion technology is evolving rapidly. Several lithium cell variants exist (Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese, Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium, Lithium Iron Phosphate, etc.) or are under intensive investigation (e. g. Lithium Sulphur, Lithium Silicon, Lithium Polymer and also a combination of several variants). For the time being none of the variants under investigation that would have a significant impact on batteries energy density (and electric vehicles range) and cost is clearly emerging as the most promising one. In addition, none of these variants reached sufficient maturity to envisage any large scale industrial exploitation. Significant investment in R&D in this area is still required.
Developing mass production of cells based on today's conventional Li-ion technologies would not give Europe an advantage to compete with world leaders in the field because Europe would lag behind in chemistries and manufacturing processes. Asian manufacturers benefit from high economies of scale because of existing mass production infrastructure and thus have the possibilities to commercially hinder new competitors from entering the market. However, Europe is strong in packaging and electronics for batteries.
It is now time to integrate battery cell production technologies into research activities. This initiative is intended to coordinate running national initiatives and prepare for stronger European research and innovation activities to be launched in the coming years. Such activities would support the objectives of the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda within the Energy Union policy.
Scope:
The scope of the topic covers production processes for future variants of lithium cells such as advanced lithium-ion not excluding the so-called post-lithium-ion technologies. Developing manufacturing processes specific to a given technology that has not yet reached the necessary level of maturity would be premature and risky. Therefore the topic focusses on the two following areas which could be applied to broader transport modes and even for stationary energy storage applications:
―To evaluate the most promising next generation of Li-ion or post-Li-ion-systems (in comparison with the best-in-class Li-ion-System) that could reach the market in the very near future and clearly identify potential challenges in the manufacturing process that would give Europe a competitive advantage when mastering the most promising improved Li-ion or post-Li-ion chemistry. The project partnership should form a forum of the different players: transport vehicles and vessels manufacturers, Tier 1 suppliers, equipment suppliers and research institutes.
―Develop new production technologies within the different manufacturing stages provided that they are generic enough to show reduced dependency on a specific chemistry to support industrial partners in the area of manufacturing and to increase the knowledge base of production technologies.
Examples of generic technologies might be:
―Battery technologies with Li-anode, bipolar batteries, all-solid-state battery technologies (e.g. ceramics, polymers, post graphite technologies …)
―Electrode coating independent of solvents or solvent free
―New processing techniques (mixing, milling of powders, new dyeing techniques, DryCoating, etc.)
―Technologies that allow integration of in-situ quality monitoring
―Methods of ultrafast handling and monitoring of electrodes (e.g. assessment of electrode quality to minimize scrap)
―Data processing, standardised interfaces according to industry 4.0
―Flexible assembly lines that can accommodate to different cell formats.
―Improvement of coating width and speed, double sided simultaneous coating (of electrode sheets)
―Coatings not needing clean rooms
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
―To allow Europe to recover competitiveness without targeting a specific technology in the production of future battery cells for transport and energy applications
―Increase production related knowledge and develop technologies for modular battery cell production lines in order to improve quality and decrease cost of battery cells that are ready to be deployed
―Contribute to sustainable production by either reducing scrap directly or recycling measures
―The results of the research could also benefit battery cell manufacture in Europe for other sectors such as stationary storage and storage for long-distance transport
―The battery concepts should improve energy, power and safety in comparison to current technical standard."

1. Specific challenge
If your company aims to deliver a meaningful impact towards sustainable development, the Green Deal topic of the European Innovation Council (EIC) pilot Accelerator may support your endeavours.
The Green Deal proposal put forward by the European Commission set the stage for an era of increased ambition towards sustainable development. It aims to make Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent and leader in circular economy and clean technologies. This goes hand in hand with a decisive effort to preserve and restore ecosystems and rural areas. Research and innovation will be a key supporting feature of such comprehensive strategy.
Such ambition is fully justified by the challenges lying ahead of us. For example, compared to the current situation in the EU, achieving the current 2030 climate and energy targets requires decarbonisation at a speed at least six times faster and additional annual investments of around €260 billion.
This EIC Accelerator topic contributes to implement the Green Deal goals. It aims to foster impact investing by supporting the development and market roll-out of innovations that can tilt our socio‑economic systems in a more sustainable path.
Scope:
2. Scope
2.1 Finance
The EIC Accelerator supports the development of business concepts into market-‑ready[1] innovations (new or disruptive technologies, products, processes, services and business models) and their roll-out.
This Green Deal topic specifically concentrates on those innovations that fuel the societal transition towards sustainability while supporting EU’s competitiveness and leadership in clean technologies.
The topic targets high-risk, high-‑potential small- and medium-‑sized enterprises (including startups) ‑from any sector provided that they contribute to Green Deal goals (as explained in ‘expected impact’).
Projects dedicated to increase the efficiency of fossil fuels technologies or fossil fuels use are ineligible.
Support may be provided in the form of a grant or blended finance (combining grant and equity).
Grant only funding (funding rate 70%) ranges from €0.5 million up to €2.5 million.
Under the blended finance option, the grant component is limited to €2.5 million combined with an equity component of up to €15 million.[2] Duly justified higher or lower amounts can be requested too.
Proposals with activities up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 may be funded by grants or blended finance. Close to market activities (TRL 9 or above) can only be financed by equity participation (as long as the proposal remains non‑bankable).
Activities could, for example, include product/service development, trials, prototyping, validation, demonstration and testing in real-world conditions, and market replication. If the activity concerns a primarily technological innovation, a TRL 5/6 or above is required for primarily technological innovation or the equivalent for non-technological innovation. Essential for the innovation project can be subcontracted.
Proposals must be based on a strategic business plan and specify the project’s success criteria and expected outcomes (as specified in ‘expected impact’).
Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership, convincing evidence or measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation must be presented (often known as 'freedom to operate'). Regulatory and standardisation issues must also be addressed.
Projects should normally take 12 to 24 months to complete but could be longer in exceptional and well-justified cases.
2.2 Business Acceleration Services
Business Acceleration Services on the ‘Green Deal’ will be provided in line with standard EIC Accelerator pilot (SME Instrument – phase 2), as described above.
Expected Impact:
3. Expected impact
Projects must support the Green Deal implementation by significantly contributing (and proposals must quantitatively estimate that contribution) to at least one of the following sustainability goals:

Proposals are expected to contribute by investing in a few other emerging and potentially promising quantum technology platforms besides the ones supported in the ramp-up phase of the Quantum Technologies Flagship, which would make it possible to complement those already funded in the Quantum Technologies flagship and which have the prospects of high scalability and fault tolerance.
Scope:
In order to reach large-scale quantum computing in Europe, breakthroughs in scalability of quantum computing processors, devices and integrated platforms are needed, together with the ability to perform qubit operations such as read, write, and data transfer, and qubit manipulation with a universal set of quantum gates. Besides the traditional quantum architectures now under development in the Quantum Technologies Flagship, further qubit and platform types, such as for example neutral Rydberg atoms, photonic qubits, and spin qubits, need to be considered as candidates for quantum computing that would require further research and development efforts.
The development of new emerging open quantum computer systems and platforms should be integrating the key building blocks such as quantum processors (> 10 qubits) with limited qubit overhead, control electronics, software stack, algorithms, applications, etc. Work should address the scalability towards large systems (>100 qubits), the verification and validation of the quantum computation, fault-tolerance and solving a concrete computational problem to demonstrate the quantum advantage.
Proposals should also cover: (i) the cooperation with complementary projects launched specifically in the area of the enabling quantum software stack (see HORIZON-CL4-2022-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-10: Strengthening the quantum software ecosystem for quantum computing platforms), including also the need to establish from the beginning of this cooperation appropriate IP exploitation agreements; (ii) any additional support they may receive from relevant national, or regional programmes and initiatives; and (iii) contribution to the governance and overall coordination of the Quantum Technologies Flagship initiative. They should also contribute to spreading excellence across Europe; for example, through the involvement of Widening Countries.

Disruptive spin-based hardware components and devices, with significant progress towards the wafer-scale integration to provide industry compatible solutions for memory, sensing, imaging, communication and computation.
First spin-based digital devices (Spin-chips) that demonstrate specific advantages of the approach and exhibit significant decrease in energy consumption.
Large-scale complete systems that include next generation spintronics devices with emphasis on compatibility, integration of different materials & technologies including CMOS and photonics.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on interdisciplinary R&D between academic research, RTOs and industry (including SMEs) in order to address at least one of the following medium term challenges in spintronic components and devices:
Develop new classes of materials (such as two-dimensional magnetic materials and heterostructures with tailored magnetic ordering, sensitive to different stimuli, e.g., light, electric field, stress etc.), achieving experimentally the largest effects allowed by physics to create new components and devices, including non-conventional ones, beyond the state of the art.
Boost utilization of Spin-Charge interconversion for detecting spin currents or manipulating the magnetization of ferromagnets: this is key for ultra-low power operations as well as for a change of paradigm in logic with the goal of cutting down the energy consumption by a factor of 1000, enabling ultra-low energy, autonomous and safe devices towards attojoule electronics.
Reach a massive gain in energy and time scales by profiting from collective spin excitations (spin waves, vortices, skyrmions) and their interaction with other waves/quanta carrying angular momentum (e.g., phonons, photons, plasmons or heat waves) for ultra-fast logic and data transfer.
Master magnetic noise, stochasticity and chaotic behaviour for improved sensitivity, room temperature operation, and development of new device functionalities that enable new architectures and algorithms for use in a variety of sectors.
Proposals should aim at demonstrating a fully functional prototype of a spintronic device operating in relevant environment conditions (TRL 4-5) in order to show how it will unlock the full potential of the field in a number of specific and high potential application areas.
The proposals that will be funded under this topic are expected to collaborate in order to create a critical mass of cooperation between EU research, industry and other relevant actors in the area of spintronics, The overall goals are to put this emerging technological paradigm firmly on the industries’ roadmaps, to foster the interdisciplinary communities that are driving this forward and to improve the visibility for all key stakeholders.

Scope:
Proposals should focus on next generation quantum sensors that provide extreme precision and accuracy measurements in many fields, beyond the performance of consumer devices and services, from medical diagnostics and imaging, high-precision navigation, and monitoring, to future applications in the Internet of Things and for enhanced measurement and metrology.
Proposals should address: (i) the development of new methods and techniques to achieve full control over all relevant quantum degrees of freedom and to protect them from environmental noise; and/or (ii) identify correlated quantum states that outperform uncorrelated systems in a noisy environment and methods to prepare them reliably. Proposed work should exploit quantum properties (such as coherence, superposition and entanglement) emerging in quantum systems to improve the performance of the targeted sensors technologies (e.g. in terms of resolution, sensitivity or noise), well beyond the classical limits.
Proposals should target the development of laboratory prototypes (from TRL 2-3 to 4-5) demonstrating the practical usefulness of engineered quantum states of light/matter to improve sensing or imaging and develop and demonstrate optimized quantum software for detection applications in real-world applications. They should leverage interdisciplinary expertise and join forces with metrology institutes or other relevant technical fields to further advance the limits of sensors sensitivity and resolution and to implement the best control protocols, statistical techniques (e.g. Bayesian, among others) and machine learning algorithms.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
Reuse of composite material and recovery of secondary raw materials with higher value than currently available;
Reduction of waste sent to landfill and positive environmental impact;
Creation of new value streams through new technologies with potential for commercial exploitation; new business opportunities and revenue flows for recycling companies, benefiting particularly SMEs which dominate this sector of the market;
Increased uptake of novel composites materials in industrial applications e.g. enhanced lightweight designs for transport, currently limited due to costs and adherence by industry to environmental legislation and the end of life directive.
Scope:
The European composites market size was worth €16 billion in 2018 and is estimated to register an annual growth rate of 7.5% from 2020 to 2025 owing to increasing demand for lightweight materials in various energy intensive value chains such as wind energy or transport. However, composites are difficult to reuse or recycle as available technologies such as high-temperature pyrolysis, and grinding (to be used as filler material) are either not environment friendly or economically unattractive. In addition, the environmental legislation on recycling of end-of-life components and structures will mean that from 2025, for example, 80,000 tons of fibre reinforced polymer composites will have to be recycled every year in Europe. In this context it is imperative that technologies are found to reuse and recycle these materials in a useful and sustainable manner. Furthermore, new solutions should also be envisaged to allow their recycling with very few or no need to separate them without a compromise to downcycling.
Proposals should:
propose innovative dismantling and sorting systems enabling reuse and functional recycling of complex composite materials;
develop and integrate novel solutions for a higher reuse of whole products and components (i.e. products’ reusability, upgradability, etc);
develop novel, safe, environment friendly and commercially attractive methods of recycling a wide range of composite materials and reuse of secondary raw materials;
demonstrate at pilot level the feasibility of reuse and/or recycle approaches of composites and its secondary raw materials, for specific applications;
develop tools that will enable to demonstrate the circularity and the environmental benefits of the solutions tested;
consider the co-design of learning resources together with local and regional educational organisations for current and future generations of employees, with the possibility of integrating them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes; learning resources should integrate the identification of new skills and should propose innovative learning-teaching methods that meet regional social needs and have a high potential for replication.
Where relevant, any solution proposed for the reduction of the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting materials should also include the appropriate management of the hazardous substances removed.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

Dissemination and exploitation of projects outputs is tailored for EU institutions, Member States and industry dealing with raw materials;
The action is expected to contribute to the implementation of the following actions of the EU action plan on Critical raw materials:[2]
Develop the EU raw materials intelligence, strategic planning and foresight capacity by 2022;
Map the potential supply of secondary raw materials from waste and stock in the EU including its regions and help identify viable recovery project for funding by 2022.
Scope:
A successful transition to a climate-neutral, circular and digitised EU economy relies heavily on a secure supply of raw materials. In order to strengthen EU autonomy and reduce over-dependency, we must boost domestic sourcing, both for primary and secondary raw materials.
Actions should be based on a common understanding of relevant terms and codes, and develop an understanding of anthropogenic resources and derive the needed aspects for classification of recovery projects and to develop criteria for a transparent, consistent and objective classification, needed to establish a comprehensive resource classification approach.
Actions should acquire new data on secondary raw materials via in situ sampling from different regions across the EU, collect existing data and present in a harmonised UNFC format. The action should build on and advance further the work of UNECE – UNFC expert group on Anthropogenic resources regarding the classification of secondary raw materials and the work of H2020 project PROSUM[3] regarding collection of data and information on secondary raw materials. The action should develop a proposal for EU statistics for secondary raw materials.
The action should focus on the following streams of secondary raw materials, with particular attention to critical raw materials: waste batteries, WEEE, mining waste, slags and ashes, and construction and demolition waste.
All the data and information generated through these actions should be shared in open formats on a free of charge basis with the European Commission, for its own use and for publication.
The action should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
The action should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU and in non-EU countries of project’s partners about the importance of raw materials for society, the challenges related to their supply within the EU and about proposed solutions which could help to improve society's acceptance of and trust in sustainable raw materials production in the EU.

Scope:
Securing the sustainable access to raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals, wood- and rubber-based, construction and forest-based raw materials, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRM), is of high importance for the EU economy. Complex primary and secondary resources contain many different raw materials. Their processing, reuse, recycling and recovery schemes are complex and imply different steps, ranging from collection, logistics, sorting and separation to cleaning, refining and purification of materials.
Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative pilots for the clean and sustainable production of non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials in the EU from end-of-life products, targeting at least one of the following: waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), batteries, wood-based panels, multi-material paper packaging, end-of-life tyres finishing at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-7.
Actions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain and should consider standardisation aspects when relevant. The action should also include the analysis of financial opportunities ensuring the market exploitation and replication of the circular business model behind the developed solutions as new processes, products and/or services.
Actions should justify importance of targeted raw materials and the relevance of selected pilot demonstrations in different locations within the EU (and also outside if there is a clear added value for the EU economy, industry and society).
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. For TRLs 6-7, a credible strategy to achieve future full-scale manufacturing in the EU is expected, indicating the commitments of the industrial partners after the end of the project.
Actions should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU about the importance of raw materials for society, the challenges related to their supply within the EU and about proposed solutions which could help to improve society's acceptance of and trust in sustainable raw materials production in the EU.
Actions should also cover social, economic and environmental impacts of recovering value from secondary raw materials in comparison to primary raw materials, making focus on the entire process chain.

Demonstrate a minimum of 20% cost reduction of power electronic modules and inverters for a given power, to increase the overall affordability of EVs in mass production (in comparison to the cost of the best current-generation or close to market components at proposal submission time).
Significant advancements in efficiency (reduction of losses by 25%) and thermal performance (increased maximum operational temperature), both parameters versus the state of the art of the targeted application. This allows further range increases, faster charging and easier thermal management of the whole powertrain, as well as possible improvement in cabin-heating and defrosting in winter.
Development of power electronics enabling drastic size and weight reductions for the electric drive, with significant advances beyond 5 kW/kg or 20kW/litre for a BEV.
Facilitating the integration of power electronics in batteries and electric motors/axles (including modular approaches).
Increased reliability and availability of powertrain by intelligent control and diagnostics techniques, predictive maintenance of machine and inverter.
Achieve automotive quality levels in the whole system with new, robust and reliable functionalities and materials.
Scope:
In the constant drive to improve efficiency and performance while increasing affordability, the recent introduction of wide bandgap (WBG) technologies (such as SiC, GaN and beyond, whose development is excluded in this topic since it is covered in the KDT partnership) need further effort for their integration in new, on-board architectures, taking into account new powertrain generations with different voltage levels, e.g. 400V, 800V and higher.
Achieving innovative compact integrated solutions will be both a strong lever for future economies of scale and a strong advantage for flexibility that will satisfy user’s needs and increase acceptance, as well as an enabler for new powertrain architectures with distributed multiple wheel drive.
Proposals are expected to address all the following:
System-partitioning/-integration: Intelligent, redundant and fail-safe topology/system architecture; highly integrated power electronics with component integration and building-block approaches for minimal level of parasitics; integration and functional modularity of power converters (integrated on-board charger and traction inverter, integrated inverter and electric motor, integrated DC/DC and inverter, high-frequency DC/DC power conversion with WBG components).
Circuit concepts and control: Topologies adapted to advanced WBG semiconductors and new materials, “including & beyond GaN”; control approaches for improved reliability as well as reduction of losses, noise and interference at a system level; novel control strategies with self-learning and intelligent monitoring capabilities, suitable for very high-frequency operation.
Interconnected technologies: robust assembly and materials, better suited for integration and new power semiconductors, alongside the capability for higher temperatures and currents, as well as extension to 3D design.
Joining and connecting technologies: Power output stages with low impedance connection and increased robustness against temperature cycling, as well as advanced interfaces for modular building blocks.
Thermal management: Module and component concepts with improved thermal performance; concepts for integrating cooling in housings, assemblies and component groups, and with environmental control if appropriate; direct liquid-cooling for high power can be considered through different solutions such as direct cooling with an immersed power module, jet impingement and spray, microchannel heatsinks or heat pipes; extension of air-cooling up to medium power levels.
Simulation/Prediction: Holistic simulation chain (e.g. along the value chain: Vehicle/ Motor/Electronics/IC); advanced physics-based simulation tools/models to increase development capabilities in order to close the gap to physical limits and reduce over-engineering; prediction of functional availability dynamically during operation predictive maintenance.
Gate Drivers: integration of the driver component with the power module to limit the stray inductance between the gate driver and the semiconductor; the gate driver should allow maximum switching speed by dealing with electromagnetic interferences (EMI) to drive wide bandgap devices.

Innovative concepts and technologies performances to create affordable, user-friendly smart and bidirectional (V2X, where X can be G for Grid, H for Home and B for Business) charging solutions, co-optimising the needs of EV users, of the house/building and of the supplying grid.
A better understanding of the operational and economic trade-offs for the user and the vehicle (e.g; cost of battery damage, additional cost for electronics to enable V2G), and on the charging (e.g. installation cost, battery damage/degradation) infrastructure of the different smart and bidirectional (V2G) charging approaches and technologies (for instance AC vs DC), as well as the costs for the different actors involved.
Contribution to the integrated planning process of systems aimed at exploiting cross-sector mutual benefits (G2X and V2X).
Contribution to the standardisation process of interfaces for V2X.
Assess customer expectations and implement an open architecture (i.e. not proprietary) concerning smart and bidirectional charging solutions, as key success factors to build a mutually beneficial charging experience for the user and for the grid.
Demonstrate V2X potential in encouraging renewable energy growth through the integration with low power renewable energy sources (e.g. photovoltaics on the roof or in parking lots), by reducing energy exchange with the grid (in both directions) by 50%.
Scope:
Digitally controlled charging solutions represent a fundamental building block of a full and effective shift to electromobility. When scaled to a mass-market-level, current uncontrolled charging (i.e. maximum available power from the moment the vehicle is plugged in) could contribute to create an extra burden on the power system. Mass availability of battery storage, provided by parked EVs (both light and heavy-duty vehicles) can however be turned into a clear upside if an integrated approach is adopted considering the different charging scenarios (public charging, home charging, depot charging, etc.). Moreover, the effective exploitation of EV charging flexibility can minimise investments in the electric grids, resulting in reduced system charges for the network users.
Proposals are expected to address all the following:
Improve the whole user experience (localization, booking, payment and billing process) when charging EVs under different scenarios (on street and in personal parking, in company and public buildings, etc.) and considering different electric vehicle fleets (passenger cars, light and medium commercial duty vehicles). The quantity and quality of drivers’ needs (e.g. range anxiety, duration and preferred time slot for charging, acceptance of incomplete charge levels), the conditions for allowing a shared control of battery State-of-Charge, and the availability to commit to vehicle utilisation limitations (rewards & penalties) have to be considered as a starting point for designing smart and bidirectional charging solutions; integration and control solutions should also be considered, in view of achieving the best customer acceptance.
Consider current slow/medium power charging, analyse and develop and demonstrate lower cost alternatives, appropriate for the mass deployment of slow charging, considering both AC and DC V2X solutions, related costs and issues (for instance power quality of AC systems), in view of optimising the cost of on-vehicle and infrastructure-side electronics.
Complementing previous bullet innovative scalable solutions for large parking areas and urban, on-road parking in smart cities, e.g. from a suitable central power system with multiple outputs vs individual distributed low power chargers, are expected to be considered, developed and validated.
In order to define optimal charging concept/strategies, trade-offs are expected to be performed in different EV penetration scenarios with a view to defining the optimal balance between the vehicle and infrastructure costs, the location and typology of charging infrastructures, and its interoperability whilst demonstrating the efficiency of V2X centralized and decentralized scenarios and catering for different EV categories, in different environments. The following alternatives are expected to be considered: public (including on-road and covered parking), private (residential and office buildings), in cities with high or low private parking availability, for light and heavy duty vehicles, in cities or countries with monophase and triphase systems, integration with personal (V2H) or business power generation (V2B), participation to grid service markets (V2G), aggregation with other consumer/prosumer facilities, behind-the-meter energy optimisation for prosumers.
The impact of the different bidirectional charging profiles on the life of the EV battery and power electronics are expected to be quantified, used to define the damage cost and, therefore, the right level of incentives for the users in allowing their battery to be used.
Performing fast charging can be an alternative to a pervasive low power charging network. These concepts are expected to be analysed and the respective pros and cons defined, including the impact on the grid of a large number of fast chargers adequately spread in the urban environment (considering the potential of local storage), with a view to providing authorities with a complete perspective of the optimal infrastructure depending on local conditions.
Defining optimal charging concept/strategies through the development of smart charging processes and data models, considering current international and European standardisation activities, minimising EV driver’s costs by rewarding their charging/discharging flexibility via effectively exploiting the storing capabilities of EVs both in a planned way (charging in low cost/generation surplus time slots) and considering contingencies (fast response in balancing grids flows fluctuations). AI-driven energy management schemes are expected to be developed, including their market and regulatory frameworks (dynamic tariffs criteria and focused incentives), to be tested preferably through regulatory sandboxes. In this respect, the communication requirements among the energy actors are expected to be evaluated, promoting the interoperability (preferably at European level) between the proposed solutions.
A final assessment of the conditions in which full V2X functionalities are needed and beneficial, and where simple V1G charge control is sufficient, are expected to be performed.
Quantitative parametric and probabilistic models for assessing the impact of progressive, massive EV penetration on the electricity system are expected to also be established: these should consider modifications of hourly/weekly load profiles, conditions for energy adequacy (primary energy supply) and power adequacy (grid congestions/reinforcements).
Clear framework for use of the necessary personal data and data portability generated by the natural persons making use of vehicle infrastructure pair should be investigated thoroughly in line with the General Data Protection Regulation.
In order to achieve a seamless smart charging experience for the EV driver, the connectivity and interoperability between the vehicle and the different players in the EV charging ecosystem, including charging point operators (CPOs), electromobility service providers (EMSPs), roaming platforms and distribution system operators (DSOs), together with access to all the necessary data to facilitate this objective, should be considered. This should help in creating an integrated mobility system, assisting drivers and passengers to take optimal decisions in selecting the charging points and overall trip planning, in terms of cost, waiting time, and the extra services provided to drivers and to vehicles.
The relevant data collection, exchange and management for smart and bidirectional charging are expected to be assessed, with a focus on the required in-vehicle data types (especially in relation to the battery management system) which are indispensable to operationalise these new charging technologies. Additionally, communication protocols and user interfaces (including the need for new/updated standards) are expected to be assessed and developed as needed in line with the work carried out by international and European standardisation organisation.

The successful proposal will support the delivery of services and solutions to implement the European Green Deal, the circular economy action plan, the bioeconomy strategy. The topic will support the transition towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just circular economy across regions of Europe at local and regional scale.
The Circular Cities and Regions Initiative’s Project Development Assistance (CCRI-PDA) will be included in the instruments implementing the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI).[1] It will be carried out in close coordination and cooperation with the CCRI.
Investors and lenders need to gain more confidence on investment projects related to circular economy which are still seen as risky. European added value can be achieved, for example, where projects introduce innovation to the market regarding financing solutions minimising transaction costs and engaging the private finance community. European added value could also be achieved where projects demonstrably address legal, administrative and other market opportunities and challenges for innovative and sustainable circular economy investment schemes.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Delivery of innovative financing schemes that are operational and ready to finance circular economy investments at local and regional scale;
Delivery of a series of sustainable circular economy projects and innovative financing solutions/schemes at local and regional scale across Europe;
Demonstration of innovative and replicable investment financing solutions, documenting feedback/uptake from potential replicators.
Scope:
The CCRI-PDA services will be provided to public and private project promoters such as local and regional authorities or their groupings, public/private infrastructure operators and bodies, utilities and services, industry (including SMEs). The action will support building technical, economic and legal expertise needed for project development and leading to the launch of concrete investments.
The purpose of the CCRI-PDA is to help project promoters develop their projects and to bring together the technical, economic and legal expertise needed for developing circular economy investment projects at local and regional scale resulting in the actual launch of investments during the action. Ultimately, PDA projects should demonstrate the financial viability and sustainability of circular economy investment projects at local and regional scale and provide tangible showcases that should trigger further market replication.
The CCRI-PDA will pay for those activities necessary to prepare and mobilise finance for investment programmes, such as feasibility studies, stakeholder and community mobilisation, business plans and preparation for tendering procedures or setting up a specific financing scheme/financial engineering.
Proposals should address the development or replication and implementation of innovative financing schemes for circular economy investments at local and regional scale.
The CCRI-PDA services should support public and private project promoters to launch investments for activities aimed at increasing circularity in economic sectors that are relevant for the transition towards a sustainable circular economy at local and/or regional scale. The economic sectors involved in each CCRI-PDA service should be selected according to local and/or regional circular economy needs, resources and potential. This selection must be clearly justified and explained.
Proposals should clearly focus their activities on the launch of significant circular economy investment programmes at local and regional scale. Ideally, the proposed investments should be launched before the end of the action, which means that projects should result in signed contracts for circular economy investments at local and regional scale to that effect.
In addition, proposals should include some of the following features:
Clearly focus their activities on the launch of significant circular economy investment programmes at local and regional scale;
An exemplary/showcase dimension in their ambition to increase circularity in specific sector(s) at local and regional scale and/or in the size of the expected investments and leverage factors[2];
Deliver organisational innovation in the mobilisation of the investment programme (e.g. bundling, pooling or stakeholder engagement);
Moreover, all proposals should demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results towards potential replicators across EU Member States and Associated Countries.
Indicatively, the CCRI-PDA focuses on small and medium-sized circular economy investments of up to EUR 20 million.[3]
The EU contribution per proposal should not exceed 10% of the respective investment.
Proposals should justify the budget for the PDA provided to public and private project promoters based on the expected investment portfolio to be set up including the expected amount of investments to be triggered and the respective leverage factors to be achieved.
Proposals are expected to ensure synergies and complementarities with other EU financial schemes for circular economy projects. Examples and background information on already existing PDA facilities are available at: https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/project-development-assistance-pda

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will contribute to all impacts in this destination related to consumers and industry, in particular to European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence by lowering the environmental footprint, enabling climate-neutrality and higher resource efficiency, through increased circularity and a resulting reduction in GHG and air pollution emissions.
Project results are expected to contribute to at least three of the following outcomes:
Increased deployment and market uptake of innovative solutions, through better design, alternative materials, business models promoting reuse, deposit systems, smart labelling in support of and complying with the current relevant legal framework and, when scope would cover the food chain, the future EU framework for sustainability labelling, etc.
Increased reuse, recyclability and upcycling of packaging and single-use plastics
Significant reduction in over-packaging and single-use plastics in consumer goods, food packaging and humanitarian relief items
Significant reduction in packaging waste and single-use plastic waste
Significant reduction in management costs for the respective waste streams
Significant reduction in the release of microplastics from packaging and single-use plastics into the environment
Scope:
The amount of materials used for packaging is growing continuously and in 2017 packaging waste in Europe reached a record – 173 kg per inhabitant, the highest level ever. In order to ensure that all packaging on the EU market is reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030, the essential requirements for packaging relate to reducing (over)packaging and packaging waste, designing for re-usable and recyclable packaging, including alternative reusable products or systems, and reducing the complexity of packaging materials.
Plastics continue to be one of the key areas in the 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP). This is due to their circularity potential, but also due to concerns about their environmental footprint and the use of primarily fossil-based feedstock for their production. One of the main sources of pollution is the amount of single-use plastics and plastics packaging that is wasted daily and that overburdens our waste and water management systems. A particular issue regarding plastics is the pollution from microplastics and disintegrating material, which reaches the soils and ocean and whose possible health impacts on animals and humans still need to be assessed in depth. Some of these microplastics are added intentionally to products such as cosmetics, while other pollution comes from the disintegration and migration of various types of plastics during their use and waste phases. Plastic waste is also an unintended consequence of humanitarian response – often funded by European taxpayer money – and leading to pollution in countries receiving aid but without the capacity to manage the waste.
In line with the EU strategy for plastics in a circular economy and the Single Use Plastics (SUP) Directive, and in line with the priorities on plastics and packaging in the CEAP, projects should combine at least three of the following elements: a reduction of (over)packaging and packaging waste, design for reuse and recyclability of packaging, a reduction of material complexity including the number of materials used (including diverse polymers), the restriction of intentionally added microplastics, increasing the uptake of alternatives decreasing the dependency on fossil fuels and the related pollution, and measures to prevent the release of microplastics at all relevant stages of the product life cycle.
Projects should demonstrate at large scale and validate innovative solutions that are quantitatively relevant and replicable under diverse economic, geographical and social conditions, and across sectors, including humanitarian response, through better design, alternative materials (including biobased and biodegradable), business models promoting reuse, recycling, upcycling, deposit systems, smart labelling, sensor-based sorting, etc. to tackle over-packaging and single-use plastics in consumer goods, food packaging and humanitarian relief items. Where the use of alternative materials is concerned, projects should address aspects to assure quality and safety of these new alternatives.
All solutions should be based on life-cycle approaches. Proposals should integrate life cycle assessment using the European Commission’s Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method and relevant costing methods. Projects should choose a systemic approach to value chains and end users, including consumers as key actors. All achieved outcomes should be demonstrated using quantitative indicators and targets wherever possible.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Research on the above issues in the humanitarian context (relating to humanitarian relief items) is also eligible under this topic.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

Successful proposals should contribute to the impacts of this destination, and the European policies it supports, in particular the European Green Deal, the circular economy action plan and the bioeconomy strategy. They should help improve European industrial[1] sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence by developing innovative bio-based products. They should engage all stakeholders and improve their knowledge and understanding of science, in particular biotechnology-based value chains, and increase benefits for consumers.
Project results should contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Deeper understanding of the structural composition of microbiomes, their structure, functions, mechanisms, and potentials, as related to bio-based innovation (i.e. bio-based materials, biochemicals, products and services, including the environmental applications), as well as improved methods of their isolation and cultivation. This should lead to innovative solutions to engineer and control microbiomes and guarantee safety and efficacy for specific applications.
Improved interdisciplinary cooperation on R&D&I between academia and industrial sectors (e.g. industrial biotechnology, food, pharma and ICT/data industries) and higher engagement of industry and SMEs.
More systematic adoption of recent advances in molecular biology and biotechnology to increase industrial uptake of R&D&I on microbiota. This includes, in particular, their complex communities via biotechnology approaches, leading to more cost- and resource-efficient production of high-value complex molecules, lowering pressure on natural resources, or increasing their use in environmental applications.
Greater and more inclusive understanding, awareness and trust in innovations, via societal dialogue and transparent communications with all stakeholders (academia, industry, including SMEs, NGOs, regulatory institutions, international partners etc.).
Scope:
Microbiomes is the term given to the collective genomes of mixed nature-based microorganism populations. In recent years, scientific-technological progress in genome sequencing and other -omics technologies and in the bioinformatic analysis and interpretation of the data has opened up the opportunity to better understand the composition of (often difficult to cultivate with existing approaches) microbial communities, the functions and interaction of their members, and their interaction with their environment (e.g. soil) or hosts (humans, animals, plants).
The scope includes developing the methods for molecular cartography, the quantitative determination of genes and metabolites and establishing the R&D resources (e.g. inventories, catalogues, “reference microbiomes”, databases etc.). Marine microbiomes are excluded from the scope, in order to avoid overlaps with the parallel topic[2].
International cooperation is encouraged, as it can contribute to European competitiveness and resilience.
Proposals should:
Develop and apply a toolbox of technologies to identify, characterise and sustainably exploit (including isolation and cultivation aspects) the microbiomes and their genetic and metabolic diversity relevant for the bio-based sectors. Develop the related microbiome-based bioprocesses, e.g. to enable industrial manufacturing of high-value bio-based substances or materials (excluding biofuels/bioenergy applications), at sufficiently large scale, or for the environmental protection applications (e.g. decomposition of persistent and hazardous contaminants or industrial, municipal waste and residues).
Identify and characterise the key environmental and safety aspects, and potential impacts, while adhering to the binding EU and international regulatory framework.
Outline the scale-up production processes for novel bio-based innovations that are necessary to reach a critical mass for a given application, to achieve economies of scale, address different market segments and potential applications, etc. This includes addressing process and product safety, including occupational and consumer safety aspects, taking into account best international practice and initiatives.
Ensure the transparent and inclusive engagement of all actors, including industry and SMEs, the scientific community, regulatory institutions, and broader civil society, including NGOs, to ensure the necessary impact and awareness.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing research projects, including on food systems, health and industrial value chains, as related to microbiomes.

In line with the European Green Deal objectives and the EU bioeconomy strategy, successful proposals will support innovators to scale-up inclusive and small-scale biobased solutions in rural areas contributing to regional, urban and consumer-based transitions towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just circular economy and bioeconomy across all regions of Europe at local and regional scale.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Enhanced cooperation between the key players and knowledge holders resulting in sustainable business model pathways for bio-based innovations in rural areas;
Provision of tailored and independent support to innovators in order to accelerate the development of marketable products and services and to improve the market penetration of bio-based solutions in Europe;
Successful deployment of existing scientific and practical knowledge and more bio-based solutions introduced in rural areas in line with relevant policy initiatives (e.g. bioeconomy strategy, European Green Deal, common agricultural policy (CAP), long-term vision for rural areas, etc.).
Scope:
Europe's future economic growth and job creations will increasingly stem from innovation in products, services and business models. This is why there is currently considerable investment in research and innovation. However, there are barriers to the adoption and implementation of research results and cooperation between research, advisory services, farmers, foresters and other actors in the supply chain is not adequately supported. Regional platforms for innovation support services are needed to help European regions develop their bio-based economies and to increase awareness and knowledge about emerging opportunities as well as the environmental and socio-economic impacts relating to the valorisation of locally or regionally available biomass.
Proposals will:
Establish regional platforms that provide innovation support services to multi-actor partnerships (e.g. farmers, foresters, clusters, business support organisations, social partners, civil society organisations including non-governmental organisations, etc.) and increase regional stakeholders’ awareness and understanding of the bioeconomy, its potential and impacts, and help them build the capacity to identify innovative bio-based business models.
Based on previous research results (e.g. BE-RURAL[1], Power4Bio[2], BioeastUp[3], etc.), activities should help match information on regionally available biomass, waste and residue streams with market information and technologies to enable full utilisation and sustainable production of bio-based products.
Help transfer training and knowledge on better nutrient recycling in the circular bioeconomy, by identifying links between different agricultural/forestry and industrial value chains, raising awareness and sharing best practice on the use of residues as soil improvers and fertiliser in the bio-based economy.
Consider contributing data and results to the European Commission’s Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy hosted by the JRC.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant topics (e.g. HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-02: Expertise and training centre on rural innovation) is strongly encouraged.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
In line with the European Green Deal objectives, EU bioeconomy strategy and blue growth strategy, the successful proposal will support the development of algae-based greener aquatic industrial products/processes and/or environmental services sustaining the health of aquatic ecosystems for a healthy planet and people.
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Leveraging of the potential of algae as an industrial feedstock by upscaling and demonstrating the techno-economic viability of algae cultivation and biotransformation concepts with positive environmental, social and economic impacts. Implementation of the European Green Deal’s sustainable blue economy and the EU bioeconomy strategy.
Provide market knowledge to align the development of new algae products to the uses and needs of various sectors.
Strengthen the competitiveness of the European blue bioeconomy and marine biotechnology industry by reducing technical bottlenecks and by developing promising business models making the whole algae sector more attractive to investment.
Provide scientific evidence on environmental benefits - including on ecosystem services, if relevant - and on risks of algae-based cultivation. Deliver - if applicable - a comparison between the environmental footprint of algae-based products and their land based counterparts.
Scope:
The farm production of micro- and macro-algae is one of the most promising emerging ocean sectors. Algae can be developed and processed into an almost endless number of products, enabling a shift to aquatic biomass production and reducing the pressure on plant biomass derived from agriculture and forestry. Total algae production in the EU increased by 76% between 2006 and 2016.
EU policy is set to unlock the versatility and potential of algae. The European Green Deal and the farm to fork strategy support the role of algae in the protein transition and its contribution to a sustainable food system. Moreover, the 2018 EU bioeconomy strategy stresses the potential of algae as a source of innovative aquatic bio-based products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and fine and speciality chemicals. The integrated processing of algae offers an interesting way to exploit, profitably and sustainably, most or all of its potential, by recovering and separating the biomass components and by minimising waste production.
Applicants should carry out activities along the following lines of research:
Demonstrate viable concepts to enable the cost-effective cultivation and processing of algae into circular bio-based products and/or environmental services (e.g. medical, cosmetics, fine and speciality chemicals, remediation). The integration with food/feed production or with other processes (such as water treatment, crop and livestock farms and carbon sequestration) could be considered if it adds to the economic, environmental and social viability of the whole concept.
Scale-up the production of algae products and bring them closer to market by addressing key challenges such as (i) optimising strains’ biology (including if relevant associated microbiomes) and the mechanisms regulating cell performance for rapid growth and high yields of novel valuable compounds; (ii) pest and disease control; (iii) standardising the product and production lines; (iv) post-harvest treatment and storage; (v) assessing risks of escape of propagules with the potential to affect local genetic biodiversity; and (vi) securing the safety of the selected applications. The efficiency and capacity of production systems should also be improved. Demonstrate downstream processing and fractionation of components that enable the practical implementation of multiproduct algal biorefineries.
Establish European strategic development plans for the proposed algae farming that address biodiversity and ecosystems considerations. Key factors such as the carrying capacity of the European seas and the availability and use of land/light/energy should be considered; Provide estimates of the market demand for algae products and of the market structure.
Quantified assessment of environmental benefits and risks of algae farming and products, including a comparison with land-based products. Assessment of possible ecosystem services of algae farming.
Strong weight is placed on industrial leadership in the projects. The emphasis should be on the delivery of tangible social and environmental benefits. Successful proposals should carry out a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the proposed concept. Efforts should be dedicated to improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work in algae farming (e.g. through the development of training material).
Where relevant, proposals may seek synergies and capitalise on the results of projects funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, its continuation European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, and other funding streams.
Cooperation with other selected proposals under this topic and complementary topics included in this work programme is encouraged. This notably includes other algae-relevant topics “HORIZON-CL6-CIRCBIO-02-04-two-stage: Photosynthesis revisited: climate emergency, “no pollution and zero-emission” challenge and industrial application” and “HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-02-05-two-stage: Innovative food from marine and freshwater ecosystems”.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
A successful proposal will contribute to all impacts in this destination related to consumers and industry, in particular to European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence by lowering the environmental footprint, enabling climate-neutrality and higher resource efficiency, through increased circularity and a resulting reduction in GHG and air pollution emissions.
Project results are expected to contribute to at least four of the following outcomes:
Increased deployment and market uptake of new technological solutions to waste management and recycling, and the measurement of recycled content
Enhanced diffusion and demonstrated benefits of advanced digital solutions in circular businesses
Emergence of new value chains using upcycled, recycled and/or biobased resources
Increased upcycling and recycling rates for the targeted material streams
Increased uptake of recycled material and upcycling to new higher-value products
Increased resource efficiency along and across value chains, causing a measurable reduction in GHG emissions
Increased diffusion of new circular business practices, in particular in the uptake of repair, reuse and remanufacturing
A significantly higher level of involvement of all actors (manufacturers, retailers, consumers, CSOs, public administration etc.) in circular practices
Increased level of information and awareness of citizens regarding circular and climate-neutral products and services
Strengthened competitiveness and job retention and creation potential of circular value chains under different economic and social conditions
Scope:
The 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP) highlights the four material streams textiles, plastics, electronics including ICT equipment, and construction as particularly important with regard to their circularity potential and their environmental footprint. The circularity deficits for these streams are mainly due to the: lack of trust in secondary raw materials; lack of control over supply chains; lacking focus on material efficiency and design for circularity; unsustainable product lifetimes; lack of repair services; price gap between primary and secondary material; lack of secondary material markets; insufficient collection and sorting systems; insufficient and unpredictable input quality for recycling; insufficient information about quality and quantity of materials, including knowledge about possible microplastics pollution and substances of concern, lack of communication along the lifecycle between manufacturers and recyclers; lack of involvement and empowerment of citizens that would allow environmentally informed purchases.
Projects should address the priorities set in the CEAP, which states that “electrical and electronic equipment continues to be one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with current annual growth rates of 2%. It is estimated that less than 40% of electronic waste is recycled in the EU. Value is lost when fully or partially functional products are discarded because they are not reparable.” Textiles are “the fourth highest-pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water, after food, housing and transport, and fifth for GHG emissions, as well as one of the highest sources of emissions of synthetic microfibers in the EU. It is estimated that less than 1% of all textiles worldwide are recycled into new textiles.” “In the light of the complexity of the textile value chain, to respond to these challenges the Commission will propose a comprehensive EU Strategy for Textiles.” It will be necessary to boost “sorting, re-use and recycling of textiles, including through innovation”, while “tackling the presence of hazardous substances”. Beside the continuous implementation of the EU plastics strategy, the CEAP has a strong focus on microplastics, but also calls for mandatory recycled content and the controlled use of bio-based, biodegradable plastics and alternative materials. In view of the feasibility problems of plastic recycling, this will require the deployment of technologies that are still in their infancy, such as the various forms of chemical and enzymatic recycling.
Projects should deal with one of the three priority material streams (plastics, textiles, electronics), taking however into account the complexity of some materials currently in use (such as composites) and that the three streams are related and to some extent overlapping (plastics-textiles; plastics-electronics), and that specific solutions might require an integrated approach.
Projects should demonstrate and deploy at large scale innovative solutions and designs for increased quality, non-toxicity and durability of secondary materials and increased share of secondary materials in new products. Projects should demonstrate increased recovery, recycling and upcycling rates and a higher uptake of secondary materials for high value applications. Projects should also demonstrate circular business practices, in particular in the uptake of repair and reuse, remanufacture, product-service-systems, and in the full lifetime of products or services. To achieve this, targeted market size, economic feasibility, cost efficiency and social acceptance need to be addressed. To break down the barriers for this transition, it is important that proposals involve and address the different perspectives of all relevant actors, e.g. manufacturers, retailers, consumers and civil society organisations (CSOs). The projects should consider the use of digital solutions and demonstrate their benefits for increased circularity. Projects should also help produce harmonised and robust methods to assess the amount of recycled content in sectoral products, which is key for a future review of green claims through authorities and consumer organisations. Environmental, social and economic impacts should be assessed from a lifecycle perspective as product, organisation and consumption environmental footprints, using the respective methods developed by the European Commission (Product Environmental Footprint, PEF, should be used for the assessment of the environmental impacts) and through costing methods; relevant data should be fed into the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment, following the specific Environmental Footprint data and format requirements. The functional performance of technologies and secondary materials can be assessed through the EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) scheme. Considering the microplastics and microfiber pollution and hazardous substances that are present in the targeted waste streams, their removal from the materials used for the products in concern as well as from the recovered material is crucial, in addition to applying less-polluting production and consumption procedures. Decontamination levels need to be properly addressed and accumulation prevented. All achieved outcomes should be demonstrated using quantitative indicators and targets wherever possible.
Projects should also develop training material to endow workers in this occupational group with the right skillset in order to deploy the new technologies developed. Proposals should consider the development of learning resources for the current and future generations of employees, with the possibility to integrate them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes. The projects should provide contributions to relevant standards or best practices.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

Successful proposals will contribute to the impacts of this destination and European policies it supports, in particular the European Green Deal, the circular economy action plan and the bioeconomy strategy. They should help to improve European industrial[1] sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence by lowering environmental footprint (including on biodiversity), enabling climate-neutrality and higher resource efficiency (in particular upcycling and cascading use of biomass) along and across value chains, developing innovative bio-based products. They should engage all stakeholders, and improve their knowledge and understanding of science, in particular biotechnology-based value chains.
Project results should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
More effective prospecting and greater use of biological diversity to generate verifiably more sustainable biomass feedstocks, including through improved harvesting, and processing, and commercially valuable climate-neutral circular bio-based, materials and products. This covers more robust verification of sustainability via life-cycle assessment approaches.
Greater resource efficiency of production pathways, by applying upcycling and the cascading use of biomass residues or side-streams (e.g. as growing substrates), leading to lower land dependence for biomass[2], and thus reducing any conflict with food/feed production.
Higher capacity and engagement of SMEs, contributing to skilled job creation and economic benefits, and improving industrial competitiveness due to the expanded range of natural ingredients for the new applications in industrial sectors. Higher functional performance of the pursued value chains and products, and more sustainable industrial practices and resource independence of the EU Member States and associated countries.
Better public understanding across the EU Member States and associated countries of biotechnology, and of the biodiversity conservation and enhancement objectives enshrined in the EU biodiversity strategy and respect to the principles of access and benefit sharing (UN Biodiversity Convention), via clear, inclusive and transparent communication strategies.
Scope:
The innovative bioeconomy sectors need to diversify and to deliver technological and industrial solutions based on available and sustainably accessible biomass. In particular, current plant-based biorefining may need upgrading to leave more land available for biodiversity protection and food production, while allowing the substitution of fossil-based resources with bio-based ones. The scope therefore covers the production of key bio-based products such as food and feed ingredients, including proteins, lipids and fibres, antioxidants and other substances with biological activities, and key bio-based materials (e.g. bio-based plastics, composites, fibres) or chemicals[3], in a resource-efficient approach[4]. This calls for identifying and optimising sources as microorganisms, insects, fungi or mixotrophic algae, which requires defining certain growing conditions in suitable systems such as biofermentors[5], where they need to be efficiently processed, extracted and converted into industrial outputs of interest. Proposals should increase circularity, in particular for the use of biomass residues or side-streams used as feed material, and should deliver necessary upgrades to and upscaling of the strategies for the cultivation, production and extraction systems.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing research projects (especially under the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking or on microbiomes). Proposals should:
Develop and demonstrate techno-economic viability of the bio-based production platforms applying the resource efficiency principles (ensuring savings on water, energy, chemical inputs, biomass waste, side-streams or residues), getting more out of less by making use of autotrophic plants and heterotrophs, and applying the modern biotechnological principles. This covers the development of a bio-based microbial production platform for high-value biologically active substances, food/feed ingredients, or bio-based materials as well as efficient separation and extraction approaches for products of interest.
Identify and implement the best combination of appropriate technical solutions and practices for specific industrial value chains (justifying the choice, including on level of innovation and business viability), as well as the barriers and drivers derived from e.g. governance and market aspects, while seeking the engagement and understanding of all actors.
Develop and transparently communicate the key parameters to monitor and measure the qualitative and quantitative impacts of these solutions and practices for different sourcing, optimization and production systems, the potential of replacing available traditional alternatives, if relevant, and trade-offs, including on biodiversity, and the associated improvement in socio-economic resilience of businesses, for the creation of jobs and industrial competitiveness.
Develop and test mechanisms involving all actors and specifically including bio-based industries active in knowledge co-creation, exchange, feedback and communication. Demonstrate them to all actors (e.g. agricultural operators, farmers, SMEs and civil society) and help them implement and understand solutions for new or improved bio-based products and processes and for addressing other environmental impacts e.g. lowered pressure on land and on biodiversity sourcing.

Scope:
The innovative bioeconomy sectors need to diversify and deliver technological and industrial solutions based on available and sustainably sourced biomass. In particular, this covers sustainable application in various industrial systems for high value products and uses, such as in the pharmaceutical, diagnostic and veterinary sectors[5], especially in the context of biorefining and other (industrial) high-value uses[6].
This calls for identifying, optimising, screening and monitoring of the growing conditions in suitable systems such as bioreactors[7], from where they need to be efficiently processed, extracted and converted into industrial outputs of interest. The scope covers innovative multi-scale bioreactor designs, and related innovations such as hydroponics systems and phenotyping platforms for increased sustainability of biomass production, and its efficient, pathogen-free processing and use.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing research projects (under Horizon 2020 and other EU-funded initiatives). Proposals should:
Develop bio-based production platforms applying resource-efficient principles (ensuring savings on water, energy, chemical inputs, biomass side-streams or residues), including the study of mixed multi-species communities, and applying modern biotechnological principles, as well as efficient separation and extraction approaches for products of interest.
Identify and implement the best combination of appropriate technical solutions and practices for specific industrial value chains (justifying the choice, including on business viability), as well as the barriers and drivers derived from governance and market aspects, while seeking engagement and understanding of all actors. Participation of industry and SMEs is considered essential.

Scope:
Successful proposals are expected to contribute towards unleashing the potential of environmental, biodiversity and climate data through dedicated European data spaces. This should allow to exploit the major potential of environmental observation[2] data in support of one or more of the European Green Deal priority actions: climate change, circular economy, zero pollution, biodiversity, deforestation and compliance assurance. Successful proposals are expected to address these challenges and contribute across all environmental areas to help harness the power of big data and artificial intelligence for the benefits of the European Green Deal. The proposals should also help in the convergence of use of high performance computing, cloud, data and artificial intelligence resources for Earth system modelling.
Proposals should contribute to the implementation of the European strategy for data in the domain of environment/climate and could act as a digital enabler for the European Green Deal in those domains. To provide a sustainable perspective for the results achieved, the data and services developed under the proposals should firmly aim to be connected into the common topical European open infrastructure, Destination Earth. Proposals should leverage environmental, geospatial and climate-related data, which are a prerequisite to better understand issues and trends on how our planet and its climate are changing and to address the role humans play in these changes. Proposals should contribute to the release and use of those data to strengthen evidence-based analytical capabilities for policy-making and implementation, including through building on the planned efforts of the European Commission Knowledge Centres on Earth Observation, Biodiversity and Bio-economy hosted at JRC. Proposals should deliver open access to data useful for decision-making by public administrations, investors, insurers, businesses, cities, rural communities, citizen scientists, civil society and citizens, and for the development of new instruments to integrate climate change into risk management practices across the EU. Proposals should build on significant gains in our knowledge over the past decades on data management, to contribute to defragmenting data flows across topics, time and space, and develop best practices in the use of existing relevant platforms such as the Copernicus DIAS and the GEOSS infrastructure, or platforms in development under e.g. Destination Earth[3], and communities in order to help prioritise and direct the efforts undertaken in the context of the European strategy for data.

They will therefore contribute a) to the enhancement of the sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers, and b) to the development of innovative governance models enabling sustainability and resilience notably to achieve better informed decision-making processes, and innovation through research and innovation in the field of digital technologies and infrastructure in agriculture.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increase transparency in the markets for digital and data technologies in the agricultural sector and in data sharing in the agricultural value chain, and support competition;
Lower the risk of investments in digital and data technologies in the agricultural sector;
Strengthen policy-making and-monitoring and foresight capacities in agriculture and digital and data technologies;
Contribute to an increased uptake of digital and data technologies in the agricultural sector and indirectly contribute to an increase in environmental and economic performance of the agricultural sector through increased and enhanced used of digital technologies and data.
Scope:
The potential of digital technologies in the agricultural sector to enhance its sustainability and economic performance and to enhance working conditions has been acknowledged. The uptake of digital technologies in the agricultural sector and the development of supplementing data-technology-based solutions in the EU are increasing. However, there is hardly comprehensive, independently collected data about the actual uptake and use of digital technologies by farmers, the trade of sector-related digital technologies, and about the extent and structure of the provision of digital and data services in the agri-food supply chain, which is of global outreach.
To the same time, policies and the regulatory framework directly or indirectly influencing the deployment of digital and data technologies in the EU is evolving in a fast pace and will continue to do so.[1] Also trade regimes are continuously changing. For stakeholder in the agricultural and the digital sector to invest in digital and data technologies, it is important to be able to assess the possible implications of changing regulatory and market conditions on the development, purchase and use of digital and data technologies in the agricultural sector.
An increase in information on markets and on the actor networks, and of the storage and the flows of goods and data, increases transparency, strengthens the consumers`/ users` position and boost competition.
Capacities in modelling and in carrying out foresight analyses for the development of markets and of the situation in the agricultural sector is also one pre-requisite for tailored policy-making.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Development of innovative approaches to assess the uptake of digital technologies and digital infrastructure (including platforms) in the agricultural sector globally with special attention to the situation in the EU and associated countries;
Development of innovative approaches to forecast the markets and the uptake of digital technologies and digital infrastructure (including platforms) globally with special attention to the situation in the EU under consideration of fast-changing regulatory framing conditions in the fields of data-, digital and machinery technologies and of agricultural policies;
Demonstration of the qualitative and quantitative implications for the use of digital and data technologies by farmers and other actors along the supply chain in a way that demonstration results can be steadily adapted to changing framing conditions. Demonstrations should allow for the reflection of scenarios.
Proposals are expected to consider innovation in digital technologies brought onto the market during the life-time of the project. They must implement the multi-actor approach involving targeted stakeholders, including farmers, agri-businesses, policymakers etc. to test demonstration and communication tools. They should also provide a basis for the development of business cases, e.g. for the integration and sharing of databases across entities and infrastructure.
For the assessment of the uptake of digital technologies by farmers, statistic approaches evolving in the EU are to be considered; assessment approaches may vary between continents and regions.

In line with the farm to fork strategy and the Headline ambitions of a Digital Age and an Economy that works for people, that works for all, leaving no one behind, the biodiversity strategy, the successful proposals will support the effective and efficient deployment of drones, including in the field of environmental monitoring. They will therefore contribute a) to the enhancement of the sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture, forestry and rural areas through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers, and b) to the development of innovative governance models enabling sustainability and resilience, notably to achieve better informed decision-making processes through research and innovation in the field of drones.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Strengthened capacities for sustainable smart farming, forestry and rural communities through exploiting the potential of drones and other remotely piloted aircraft systems.
Strengthened the capacities for plant, plant-health, livestock, livestock-heath, and agri-environmental monitoring (including tree health) through the use of drones and other remotely piloted aircraft systems.
Reduced risk of the use of drones and other remotely piloted aircraft systems.
Scope:
The increased use of drones for sectoral and societal purposes can be observed in the EU. Also in the field of agricultural production, drones are used in the EU, whereby to different extents across Member States because of environmental, socio-economic and also regulatory framing conditions. While the use of drones can bring advantages to agricultural production, e.g. to collect data on crop conditions, it also goes along with risks emanating from the use of the unmanned vehicle itself, or the activity it is carrying out. For several reasons, e.g. a lack of cost-effectiveness, the potential of drones is not fully exploited by the agricultural sector in the EU. When exploring the opportunities to increase the use of drones, the consideration of aspects related to the safe use and the interests of the society at large, which might be negatively affected by the use of drones, is of outermost importance. To the same time, drones can also deliver services of common interests, which have the potential to be well linked to the agricultural use of drones, for instance, the collection of environmental information in agricultural landscapes, such as about landscape features, water quality or soil quality, and biodiversity in and around utilised agricultural areas. Exploring possibilities to use drones as multi-purpose vehicle in rural areas, e.g. for reasons of cost-effectiveness is of interest.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Stock-taking of innovation in the use of drones as multi-purpose vehicle in agricultural production, forestry and the development of rural communities globally, the advantage and disadvantages of different approaches, and perform comparative analyses with the situation of the use of drones in the EU.
Development of innovative approaches to use drones and other remotely piloted aircraft systems as multi-purpose vehicle in agriculture, e.g. for production assessment, cover-crop seeding, pest and disease detection, harvesting planning as well as innovative approaches to use drones as multi-purpose vehicle linking agricultural and wider environmental observation interests (including the assessment of landscape features, forests, water quality, and soil carbon) and for rural services.
Assessment of the potential of the use of drones and other remotely piloted aircraft systems in the agricultural sector and socio-economic and environmental effects under consideration of different regulatory scenarios.
Development of business models to the use of drones and other remotely piloted aircraft systems in agriculture, which may include agriculture / forestry / community development interlinkages.
Development of innovative approaches to assess and reduce the risks related to the use of drones in the agricultural sector, especially in the context of spraying.
Projects are expected to take into consideration the results of other related Horizon 2020/ Europe projects, such as AW-Drones[1] and ROMI[2], as well as of other relevant projects and initiatives.
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties e.g. to academic researchers, hi-tech startups, SMEs, rural communities and other multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate developed assessment approaches or collect or prepare data sets or provide other contributions to achieve the project objectives. A maximum of € 60 000 per third party might be granted. Conditions for third parties support are set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted. Maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.

In line with the farm to fork strategy and the Headline ambitions of a Digital Age –the data Strategy in particular - and the headline ambition an Economy that works for people, leaving no one behind, the successful proposals will support capacities to understand, develop and demonstrate the data economy in agriculture and its effects. This topic aims to contribute a) to the enhancement of the sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers, and b) to the development of innovative governance models enabling sustainability and resilience notably to achieve better informed decision-making processes through research and innovation related to data economy in agriculture.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Awareness and informed decisions based on the demonstration of the costs, benefits, risks, and added value as well as the economic and societal potential of agricultural data sharing taking an EU perspective.[1]
Increase in transparency in data sharing in the agricultural value chain.
Increased sharing of agricultural data, and the effective and efficient use of private and public data for private and public purpose, particularly through the demonstration of the costs, benefits, risks, and added value as well as the economic and societal potential of agricultural data sharing taking an EU perspective.[1]
Contribute to an increased uptake of digital and data technologies in the agricultural sector and indirectly contribute an increase in environmental and economic performance of the agricultural sector through increased and enhanced used of digital technologies and data.
Strengthen policy-making and-monitoring capacities in agriculture and data technologies.
Scope:
Used effectively, agricultural data has the potential to increase the performance of the sector and of businesses along the supply chain in a sustainable way as well to as to serve public good purposes. For instance, agricultural data forms a key input to precision farming applications and can form input to the analysis on environmental conditions as well as to other fields, e.g. bioinformatics. Thus, agricultural data has a value and presents an interesting element for the data economy.
A crucial parameter to the effectiveness and efficiency of the application of data technologies is the quantity and quality of agricultural data serving as basis for such analyses. However, agricultural data, which stems from multiple sources and includes business, personal and public data, is not straightforward accessible, not even for fees/ financial resources.
Next to technical issues related to e.g. data interoperability, questions on the ownership of agricultural data and the readiness to share the data present a burden to the use of agricultural data. Farmers, for instance, need to trust that their farm data is handled and share carefully, and have to see their and societal benefits to share the data, and have a stake in the economic benefits of agricultural data.
Currently, some companies in the agri-food value chain are collecting agricultural data, e.g. through farmers as customers. Not always is the use of that data, e.g. for product development or farm-tailored advertisement, fully transparent. Moreover, some companies with high numbers of customers, easily gain enormous market power and generate income through the use of the collected data and the application of data technologies.
Developments in the agricultural sector as well as in EU policies[3], which are/ will be addressing those circumstance to increase the readiness to data sharing to increase the benefit for the economy and society and to overcome power imbalances and a lack of transparency in the use of data, occur rapidly. These changing framing conditions offer opportunities as well as challenges to the agricultural sector as well as to the data economy.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:
Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the effects of various data sharing and marketing and use options (considering among others private and public data, private and public actions, and big data opportunities) for the actors along the agri-food supply chain and the development of scenarios for the data economy.
Implications of the ongoing policy-making process at EU level including the development of relevant legislation in the analyses.
Effects of multi-level governance systems in the EU under consideration of the situation and conditions in various Member States as well as effects of international (trade) relations.
Consideration of multiple data-sharing business- and governance approaches and technical solution in data sharing in the agricultural sector.
Consideration of climate adaptation and reducing administrative burden in the assessment of the potential of agricultural data sharing for the sector and the society.
[1]The main focus is with the agricultural sector and public interests in the EU. However, as data flows and trade relations are global, analyses have to go beyond the EU context.

The successful proposal will support the preparation, facilitation and pavement of the way for pre-commercial procurement in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation to enable up-scaling and wide use of end-user services to respond to common needs in this area. The successful proposal will be contributing to the European Green Deal objectives by further deploying and exploiting the use of environmental observations[1].
In order to do so the project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Creation of a critical mass of procurers of solutions and services in the area of climate change adaption and mitigation, which will undertake joint, cross-border or coordinated procurements;
Description of the common needs of the public procurers for end-user services in the area of climate change adaption and mitigation;
Reduced fragmentation of public sector demand via creation of a network(s) of public procurers capable of collectively implementing PCPs and/or public procurement of innovative solutions (PPIs);
Increased awareness in the network of procurers of relevant standards, certification and GEO data sharing principles;
Leverage of additional investment in research and innovation in the domain of environmental observation and the Copernicus Climate Change Service;
Increased awareness and successful use of public procurement to boost innovation and increased exchange of experience in procurement practices and strategies (organising trainings and other information exchange tools) in the specific area of climate services.
Scope:
The project is expected to prepare a pre-commercial procurement due to be part of the Cluster 6 work programme for 2023 in the domain of climate change services using the information and data from the Copernicus programme, GEO initiatives, other relevant initiatives such as EMODnet, European Commission Knowledge Centre on Earth Observation hosted at JRC, European research infrastructures and the broad range of environmental information.
The action should deliver all the necessary elements in preparation of the PCP as described in Annex H of the general annexes to this work programme.
Proposals should lead to the establishment of a critical mass of public and/or private procurers in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation, to overcome the fragmentation of demand for solutions and services and to lead to a more rapid market uptake of such solutions and their early deployment. Demonstrated engagement from participants for a further Europe-wide take-up and rollout of results during and following the proposal are expected. Proposals should implement an open market consultation to gain insights into state-of-the-art technologies and ongoing developments, including prototypes and demonstration services coming out of relevant Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, ESA and national projects. This could include new approaches for market consultations with suppliers, paying special attention to SME suppliers.
Proposals should engage public and/or private procurers from each country participating (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area(s).
The network(s) of public and/or private procurers created should investigate the feasibility of, test and prepare the launch of joint or coordinated procurements (PCP), which would ultimately develop innovative, fully tested, fit-for-purpose and cost-effective end-user services in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation. These solutions should be based on a complete set of common needs and specifications. Finally, to facilitate future replication, a set of well-documented practices should be made available.
Preparation activities for the joint or coordinated PCP will be supported, but not the costs of the procurement resulting from any PCP procedures.
Project duration should be 24 months.

Deadline date","Scope:
Awareness and consciousness have been high on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) research agenda for decades. Progress has been difficult because it has been hard to agree on exactly what it means to be aware. Most researches would agree though that we do not have any truly aware artificial system yet, that awareness is much more than a sensorial sophistication and that it is much more than any Artificial Intelligence as we know it. But, what is it then that a user would expect from a service or device that has ‘awareness inside’?
Most scientific and philosophical accounts of awareness are based on a human subject perspective and at an individual level. They address the question of what it means for an individual human subject to be aware of, e.g., the environment, time or oneself and how one can assess awareness in this context. The problem is relevant, certainly, since many clinical and cognitive conditions can be linked to awareness issues. The concept is also relevant to emerging technologies as it has been argued, for instance, that humans will not accept robots (or chatbots, or decision support systems) as trustable partners if they cannot ascribe some form of awareness and true understanding to them.
The individual human-centric concept of consciousness hinders the application of awareness as a measurable feature of any sufficiently complex system. The study of awareness in other species and artefacts, or even more elusive concepts such as social awareness require a new perspective applicable to many systems. It can then also serve to attack the inter-subjective state and experience of awareness (i.e., what is it like to interact with an aware robot that, most probably, does not have the same kind of awareness than the human?), or to include non-conscious objects into the sphere of awareness (e.g., to become aware of the time without looking at the watch).
For technologies, awareness principles would allow a step-up in engineering complex systems, making them more resilient, self-developing and human-centric. Awareness is a prerequisite for a real and contextualised understanding of a problem or situation and to adapt ones actions (and their consequences) to the specific circumstances. Ultimately, awareness serves the coherent and purposeful behaviour, learning, adaptation and self-development of intelligent systems over longer periods of time.
Specific conditions for this challenge
Proposals are expected to address each of the following three expected outcomes:
1. New concepts of awareness that are applicable to systems other than human, including technological ones, with implications of how it can be recognised or measured. It will require to elucidate the relationship between, among others, complexity and awareness, information structure and representation, the environment and its perception, distributed versus centralized awareness, and time awareness. This will lead to better approaches for defining aspects of awareness over different temporal, spatial, biological, technological and social scales.
2. Demonstrate and validate the role and added-value of such an awareness in an aware technology, class of artefacts or services for which the awareness features lead to a truly different quality in terms of, e.g., performance, flexibility, reliability or user-experience. The specific expected outcome is a proof of principle of technologies far beyond the current state of the art or a laboratory-validated prototype enabling evaluation of the proposed technology’s awareness features, relying where relevant on neuroscientific and psychological methods, and possibly in a range of application areas. As examples, projects could investigate the implications of ’awareness inside’ for safer robots or self-driving cars, for better resilience of critical infrastructure, in artefacts that compensate for consciousness disorders, in decision support (e.g. for surgery, economics or epidemiology), or for chatbot-based conversation, language learning or translation.
3. Define an integrative approach for awareness engineering, its technological toolbox, the needs and implications and its limits, including ethical and regulatory requirements. On this aspect specifically, the projects that will be funded under this challenge are expected to collaborate and contribute to the wider ethical, societal and regulatory debate since, ultimately, new awareness concepts may lead to a redefinition of how we look at the relation between humans, other species and smart technologies. The gender dimension in research content should be taken into account, where relevant, to maximise user experience.
This Challenge is only open to proposals for collaborative projects with at least 3 partners following the standard eligibility conditions. Proposals are required to comply with the Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence principles

","Innovation action
","07 May 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
CCUS in industrial applications faces significant challenges due to its high cost and the fierce international competition in the sectors concerned. However, these sectors currently account for 20% of global CO2 emissions, and in the 2 degree scenario, should represent half of the stored CO2 by 2050. Relevant sectors with high CO2 emissions are for example steel, iron and cement making, oil refining, gas processing, hydrogen production, biofuel production and waste incineration plants.
Scope:
Projects will focus on integrating CO2 capture in industrial installations, whilst addressing the full CCUS chain. Projects will elaborate a detailed plan on how to use the results, i.e. the subsequent transport, utilisation and/or underground storage of the captured CO2. Important aspects to address are of technical (e.g. the optimised integration of capture plant with industrial processes; scalability; CO2 purity), safety (e.g. during transportation and storage), financial (e.g. cost of capture; cost of integration) and strategic nature (e.g. business models; operation and logistics of industrial clusters and networks).
Projects are expected to bring technologies to TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Technology development has to be balanced by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations. Relevant end users and societal stakeholders will be identified in the proposal, and their concerns and needs will be analysed during the project using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities, in order to create awareness, gain feedback on societal impact and advancing society’s readiness for the proposed solutions. Projects should also explore the socio-economic and political barriers to acceptance and awareness with a view to regulatory or policy initiatives.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with relevant Mission Innovation[1] countries such as China[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 10 to 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Successful, safe and economic demonstration of integrated-chain CCUS from relevant industrial sources such as mentioned in the specific challenge will accelerate the learning, drive down the cost and thus help break the link between economic growth and the demand for industrial output on one hand, and increasing CO2 emissions on the other hand. The impact of projects under this call will to a large extent be determined by the extent to which the results will be exploited, i.e. the plan on how the captured CO2 will be actually utilised and/or stored, either in the project or planned as a future phase. This will be evaluated based on the maturity and quality of the proposed post-capture solutions. Projects under this call that are carried out in areas where there is both a high concentration of CO2 emitting industries and a nearby capacity for geological storage are considered prime sites for hub and cluster developments, and will generate the highest impact on full-scale deployment in the medium to longer term.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to take exceptionally promising and innovative energy solutions with high potential impact to real breakthrough and market application. Boosting the breakthrough of particular promising technologies requires both a focused and adaptive approach, to secure that investment brings innovation that is taken up by the market - or discontinues an investment that has too limited expected impact. Specific fields where disruptive rather than incremental innovation is needed are the integration of renewable energy into smart buildings, and sustainable fuels. A specific challenge is to develop efficient fully transparent photovoltaic (PV) cells that only absorb light in the non-visible part of the spectrum, so that they can be integrated on a wide scale as windows in buildings. Another specific challenge is to enable production of sufficient quantities of liquid fuels that do not compete with food for land, do not displace land uses, are cost competitive to fossil fuels and substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Scope:
Proposals are invited in (only) one of the following two sub-topics:
Photovoltaic windows ('transparent' solar cells): development of transparent and economically viable PV cells for integration in building applications. Projects should demonstrate a prototype 'PV window' which allows the visible light to pass through unhampered, and has the potential to achieve the lifetime and conversion efficiency of commercial PV modules (resp. 25 years and at least 12%).
Bionic leaf technology: advanced renewable fuel production through biological conversion of CO2 and renewable hydrogen in the presence of inorganic catalysts. The process is based on first using solar energy to split water molecules and then using bacteria to consume the hydrogen together with CO2 to produce fuel, and currently has an efficiency of 10%. Projects should advance the overall efficiency of the process for existing or new biosynthetic systems up to 15% under ambient air conditions by enhancing the water splitting efficiency and improving the engineering of bacteria and their interface with the catalysts in order to boost their growth at all conditions.
Proposals are expected to bring the technologies from TRL 3 to at least 5. Proposals need to demonstrate a clear technology development roadmap for their solutions, including a strong exploitation plan presenting their business opportunities and impact potential. The technological development risks need to be clearly identified and relevant mitigation measures given. Life cycle analysis shall be considered.
Projects selected under this pilot will follow a stage-gate approach based on milestones and periodic reviews. A first review by the Commission - with the help of independent experts - will take place after 6 months, based on an assessment by InnoEnergy[1] of the feasibility and innovation potential of the proposed solution or application, analysing a.o. the business and innovation strategy, the technology readiness level of the proposed application, the consortium's freedom to operate (e.g. background, foreground, IP), and the market. This review will lead to a first go/no go decision.
Throughout the duration of the Grant Agreement, and agreed therein, Inno Energy will be involved in providing support to innovation and business development, including completing the market uptake supply chain, using external expertise, with the aim to strengthen the consortium's innovation performance.
The Commission considers the proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between 2 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Transparent, visually non-intrusive PV windows have a significant market potential, because they could be fitted to existing buildings, without the need to cover large new areas to collect solar energy; every glass surface could produce solar power. As such PV windows block much of the infrared radiation, they would cut down on air conditioning needs, further reducing energy use and operating costs in buildings.
An economically viable bionic leaf technology with increased efficiency well beyond the state-of-the-art has significant market potential and environmental impact, because it will enable development of sustainable fuel for transport that will completely replace fossil fuels and their best alternatives. Converting 50% of all industrial CO2 emissions into fuels using this process at an efficiency of only 15% would avoid half of today's transport GHG emissions. Moreover, this will improve Europe's energy security while at the same time create economic growth.

For off-grid communities, research and development is needed to bring down the cost of renewable electricity solutions in diverse geographic and climate conditions by improving at the same time their performance in respect of robustness, reliability, network stability and autonomous operation. Existing micro-grid solutions do not fully respond to the needs of communities in respect of investment costs, versatility, plug and play capabilities, easy installation and connection to the renewable energy source, easy and cost-saving logistics as well as maximisation of the renewables share.
Scope:
Container-based integrated solutions for sustainable and long-term renewable electricity production, storage and distribution which demonstrate better performance than state-of-the-art solutions with respect to the overall installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance costs. The following parameters and features are expected to be optimised:
Versatility of renewable energy sources to utilise (e.g. photovoltaics, wind, micro-hydropower, bioenergy);
Plug and play capabilities towards the external electricity sources as well as storage options;
Maximising the share of renewable electricity sources vis-á-vis diesel generation;
Demonstrated solutions should support power demand of decentralised communities up to 100 kW, in line with targets of Mission Innovation Challenge Nr. 2.
A plug and play prototype should be fully demonstrated, including single shipment of the core system in an intermodal container. Local installation of the fully operational system by the local community should also be demonstrated. Demonstrations shall take place in at least two communities with diverse physical landscape and climate conditions, which are located in different continents. Those demonstrations should use different renewable energy sources locally available. Necessary power generation equipment shall be shipped together with the container; nevertheless, the project should also allow for integration of existing renewable electricity installations in loco by also providing necessary hardware and software interfaces, including those for remote operation and maintenance training. The container should include equipment for energy management and metering as well as system monitoring for demand response optimisation. Renewable drop-in solutions for commercially available equipment developed primarily for fossil fuel use (e.g. biodiesel in combination with diesel generators) are not in scope of the demonstration.
Furthermore, projects proposals should foresee to exchange information with the BRIDGE project[1] and to elaborate on the suitability of the demonstrated solutions for crisis intervention after disasters.
This topic will contribute to the Challenge #2 (Off-grid access to electricity) of Mission Innovation.
Proposals are expected to bring the technology from TRL 6-7 to 7-8.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 5 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:

Researchers and industries are presenting innovative solutions, but to accelerate the development pathway to the market, new testing methodologies will help industries to take more quickly go/no-go decisions. For this a better understanding of basic ocean energy sciences is required to develop the research competences and the underpinning scientific knowledge for the testing methodologies.
Scope:
The actions should generate one or more new test rig prototype devices including novel test procedures that should be used by multiple ocean energy technology developers, and facilitate design convergence. This will support improved testing of low TRL wave or tidal device components or sub-systems – e.g. facilities, tools and procedures - and make accelerated life testing possible, considering for instance efficiency, reliability, survivability and/or environmental impact.

Two barriers are at stake: (i) the supply of sustainable biofuels at competitive market pricing to become commercially attractive to airlines, notably enabling to overcome the economic gaps evolving from the fact that fuel represents circa one-third of the operational costs of an airline; (ii) the operation and logistics of handling such biofuels in the operational context of a major airport – including procurement, blending, fuelling, quality control and safety due processes - as a condition sine-qua-non for its penetration within the aviation’s supply-chain. This challenge is designed to tackle this latter deadlock. It is in line with the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) and the specific targets for commercialization of advanced biofuels identified in the Declarations of Intent in the context of the SET-Plan, Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive and Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA).
In addition airports are commercial sites with significant greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Novel concepts and solutions aimed for enhancing the capability of airports communities in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change are needed in meeting the 2050 policy targets. Specific solutions based on a holistic perspective that integrates the airport physical and operational infrastructure with their users, business and logistics operators, peripheral businesses, and ultimately with the whole transportation system that uses and commutes to the airport, as well as the physical environment it is embedded in.
Scope:
Proposals will demonstrate novel concepts and solutions aimed at developing effective solutions for the take-up of biokerosene and other relevant alternative fuels by aviation. The actions should be designed towards ensuring a strong demonstration component involving an exchange of best-practice within the airports participating in the project.
Herein, Lighthouse Airports (the airport that leads the consortium and where the demonstration actions will be implemented) are expected to closely collaborate with Fellow Airports (the airports that participate in the consortium and follow closely the developments and demonstration actions at the Lighthouse airports) in supporting the transfer and tailoring of best-practice solutions tuned to the specific local conditions of the latter.
Each consortium will have one Lighthouse Airport that will demonstrate the novel concepts and solutions and a further two ""Fellow Airports"" that will follow closely the demonstration actions and are committed to implementing the best practices identified in the project. The Lighthouse Airport must be in a different EU Member State or Country associated to Horizon 2020 than at least one of the Fellow Airports. To increase the impact beyond the airports participating in a consortium, the project will develop a bold vision for the future Smart Airport of 2050. This should cover the relevant sustainable mobility, technical, operational, economic, environmental and social aspects that are expected to shape the airports of the future as well as their integration in the urban hinterland. In addition, the projects should also include a handbook on how to move from planning through implementation to replication and scaling-up of the successful demonstrated solutions in such an over-arching context.
All biofuels and other relevant alternative fuels must meet the EU sustainability criteria as these are defined under the Renewable Energy Directive[1] (RED) and its recast[2] (REDII). In this context, advanced sustainable biofuels of EU or local or regional origin are highly preferable.
In such a wide context, it is necessary that projects guarantee a holistic perspective in tackling the questions at stake, by systematically addressing all aspects mentioned in the following activity areas:
A) Smart use of biofuels in airports and other relevant alternative fuels in aircraft:
Proposals will address all of the following:
Integration of sustainable bio-kerosene and other relevant alternative fuels in the fuelling infrastructure and associated fuel handling logistics of the airport, including blending operations resulting in blends compliant with the ASTM standards.
Promote decarbonisation of aviation, and airports while improving local air quality by stimulating the uptake of sustainable biokerosene and other relevant alternative fuels blends;
Ensure the development of scalable solutions –replicated/gradually scaled-up to larger or scaled-down to smaller airports, together with the demonstration of their environmental sustainability and technical, operational, and economic, reliability;
Incorporate field performance monitoring of the deployed solutions starting at least 6 months before the innovative solutions are applied to be followed for a period of at least 1 year within the project duration. This will allow comparing the effectiveness of the deployed solutions.
Projects should deliver all of the following:
Projects should include specification of the following key quantities for each of the participating airports: blending percentage; total volume of fuel to be blended with bio-kerosene and total fuel consumption.
Guidelines and metrics to support the transfer of best-practice results into other airports, in particular for purposes of:
Quality control of the sustainable bio-kerosene and of the blended fuel supplied to the airlines, including consideration of aspects such as source and seasonal variations.
Aircraft fuelling logistics, including relevant procedures and associated due processes – e.g. fuel handling, safety considerations.
Collecting feedback from airlines on the impact of using sustainable bio-kerosene and other relevant alternative fuels blends on commercial operations – notably, in engine performance and maintenance.
Notification by the airport to the national authorities regarding the use of bio-kerosene in compliance with the prevailing environmental and transport regulations in force –volumes and qualities of biofuels, certification schemes used, GHG reduction, number of flights fuelled with bio-kerosene.
Key economic indicators associated with a fully-fledged commercial scenario of bio-kerosene and other relevant alternative fuels –price of the bio-kerosene and other relevant alternative fuels and final blends, price variations and trends, market availability of bio-kerosene and other relevant alternative fuels, security of supply. If possible, collect feedback from airlines regarding bio-kerosene and other relevant alternative fuels differential cost coverage.
Gathering passenger perception on using flights operated with a blend of sustainable biokerosene and other relevant alternative fuels.
To enable a widest dissemination of the lessons learned the solutions demonstrated should be monitored, analysed and eventually elaborated in accessible best-practice handbooks and tools, covering:
The state-of-the-art and reliable sustainable solutions for aircraft fuelling with bio- kerosene, addressing notably:
the procurement of bio-kerosene;
the assessment of its impact on the airport energy system;
the airport planning requirements and operational processes to support large scale roll-out – e.g. handling, quality control, safety;
the availability of fit-for-purpose storage and blending facilities.
2. Practical recommendations arising from the project experience on issues relating to
regulatory, legal and data security/protection aspects, including those that might hamper the adoption of the solutions demonstrated for sustainable biokerosene;
Description of effective business models for the different sustainable solutions, that reflect the relevant technical, operational, economic, social and legal/regulatory implications of their adoption;
B) Smart Energy in airports:
Projects will demonstrate novel concepts and solutions aimed at improving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and facilitating adaption to climate change.
Projects will address all of the following aspects:
Promote decarbonisation of aviation, airports and terminals while improving air quality, such as by using smart solutions for aircraft taxiing (electrification);
Integrate planning and management of the energy and transport infrastructures at airports, developing planning and infrastructure management tools supported by intelligent networks improve the energy and resource efficiency at airports, and the use of renewable electricity that integrates airport-specific infrastructures and energy uses (e.g. taxiing, ground handling, including through e-mobility) with other infrastructure and uses (e.g. heating, electricity);
Ensure the development of scalable solutions –replicated/gradually scaled-up to larger or scaled-down to smaller airports, together with the demonstration of their environmental sustainability and technical, operational, and economic reliability;
Promote governance that addresses the interactions between airport authorities, local communities and local authorities and particularly city planning departments;
Incorporate field performance monitoring of the deployed solutions starting at least 6 months before the innovative solutions are applied to be followed for a period of at least 1 year within the project duration. This will allow comparing the effectiveness of the deployed solutions;
Practically tested and proven solutions to maximise use of sustainable e-mobility solutions of the airport operations (e.g. taxiing, passenger logistics, fuelling logistics, etc);
Effective innovative ways of increasing energy efficiency (waste heat recovery, battery storage etc.) and renewable energy in all relevant areas of the airport activities based on a thorough analysis of energy and resource flows (e.g. with the involvement of energy service companies, ESCOs). Increased sourcing of electricity and heat from renewable energy sources (e.g. through own generation or power purchasing agreements) can be combined with energy efficiency through smart grid approaches.
These solutions should be monitored, analysed and elaborated in accessible best-practice handbooks and tools including existing state-of-the-art and reliable sustainable solutions related to:
electro-mobility; the assessment of its impact on the energy system within the boundaries of the airport, notably as support to air operations – e.g. aircraft taxiing, ground handling, emergency control.
Infrastructure management and planning tools that are able to gather and combine data from different sources and allow optimisation of energy and resources;
Best practice examples of transport solutions within and around the airport.
Proposals must foresee a work package for cooperation with other similar actions and earmark appropriate resources (at least 3% of the requested EU contribution) for coordination and communication efforts and relevant research work with other projects and initiatives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately (of which around 2/3 must be dedicated to aspects relating to ""SMART use of biofuels in airports"" and around 1/3 must be dedicated to aspects relating to ""Smart Energy in airports""). Typically, projects should have a duration of 48 to 60 months. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations. At least 15% of the requested EU contribution should be for the Fellow airports.
The technology related to the utilisation of biokerosene in airports will move the TRL from 6 to 8 (see part G of the General Annexes). The TRL refers to infrastructure and biokerosene logistics, blending, fuelling et al. and not to technology for fuel production.
Eligible costs are primarily those that concern the innovative elements of the project needed to:
foster innovative overall energy systems integration;
demonstrate effective integration of transport modes within and around the airport;
foster wider use of electrification at airports.
Costs of commercial technologies are not eligible, for example:
Buildings: purchase, construction, retrofitting and maintenance;
Electric vehicles and charging stations: purchase, installation and maintenance;
Airport ICT platforms: purchase, development and maintenance;
Standard, commercially-available RES: purchase, development and maintenance;
Biokerosene or biokerosene blends, or other relevant alternative fuels: direct purchase.
Expected Impact:
The supported projects are expected to facilitate the deployment of advanced biofuels, e-mobility, energy storage and waste heat recovery in airports and reduce greenhouse gas and other air pollutants (e.g. sulphur oxides and particulates) emissions by airports. Projects should measure the reduction in GHG emissions due to actions demonstrated. Projects should measure the improvements in ambient air quality by the reduction of emissions due to the actions demonstrated.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The user requirements process undertaken by the Commission and the Space Strategy for Europe has identified possible evolutions of the space observations capabilities in the context of Copernicus. These are described below, and specific guidance documents explaining the ongoing process to gather new user requirements will be provided[1].
The following three priorities have been identified for potential evolution of Copernicus in the future:
Monitoring of the Polar Regions, notably the Arctic, specifically for sea ice and environmental conditions
Agriculture monitoring, specifically for supporting the Common Agricultural Policy.
Forest monitoring, specifically for supporting the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) process at international level.
The development, the implementation and eventually the operation of an enhanced European capacity will need the involvement of various players, such as National Space Agencies, European and Member States Institutions, International Organisations, the private sector, operators of in-situ measurement stations, and of leading scientific experts in the identified fields such as data assimilation and modelling for the Arctic, agriculture monitoring and forest monitoring. In particular, it will need to build on past activities of the European Space Agency (ESA) and will need to be coordinated with the ESA's on-going and future programmes.
Initiating and consolidating the establishment of the community and thus reaching the critical mass required for addressing such a challenging endeavour. It will also need to take into account current and planned activities led by the Copernicus Programme (space component and services, i.e. marine, climate, land/cryosphere) for future services as well as the current H2020 projects relevant for example for Arctic monitoring (i.e. INTAROS).
Scope:
The scope is identified according to the possible evolution scenarios indicated above. Each proposal shall address only one of the following sub-topics.
A – Preparation of a European capacity for monitoring the Polar Regions
To advance a coordinated preparation of a mature European capacity there is a need to bring together the key European stakeholders and competent entities which are:
Engaged in activities that can answer questions raised in the user requirements gathering process;
Have the ability to network with suitable research actors to fill the knowledge gaps;
Have the required expertise to assess the needs for an end-to-end operational system, with due attention to potential international cooperation opportunities for tackling this global challenge.
At the same time, there is a need for an accompanying scientific and technical support to address:
Ways to improve Copernicus' ability to describe the changing polar regions, including the snow/ice coverage, salinity, sea ice, permafrost, the biogeochemical state of the ocean, biodiversity in light of different scenarios of availability of additional complementary data from space;
Identification of research gaps regarding integration/assimilation of space based data into sea state, ocean physics, biogeochemistry and ice models;
Ability to provide not only sea-ice mapping but also sea-ice forecasts for maritime purposes, and as essential climate variable and/or essential ocean variable;
Assessment of access to adequate and sustained in-situ observing systems and the necessary research gaps to fill in terms of assimilation/modelling capacity.
Activities shall thus encompass the coordination of ongoing efforts, include mutual identification of research and infrastructural gaps, and facilitate a cooperation of further research and development to be undertaken to reach sufficiently mature capacities for an operational integration as a subsequent step.
B – Preparation of a European capacity for improving agriculture monitoring
To advance a coordinated preparation of a mature European capacity in this agriculture monitoring field, there is a need to bring together the key European stakeholders and competent entities which are:
engaged in activities that can answer questions raised in the user requirements gathering process and under an extended scope of activity;
have the ability to network with suitable research actors to fill the knowledge gaps;
have the required expertise to assess the needs for an end-to-end operational system, with due attention to potential international cooperation opportunities for tackling this challenge from local to global levels in a cost efficient way.
At the same time, there is a need for an accompanying scientific and technical support to address:
Ways to improve Copernicus' ability to support precision agriculture, the monitoring of crop extension and composition, the monitoring of hydrological stress and water needs for irrigation, the forecast of agricultural yields from local and national up to global scale the assessment of crop diseases and nutrient deficiency in light of different scenarios of availability of additional complementary data from space;
Identification of research gaps regarding integration/assimilation/utilization of space based data for agriculture monitoring at global, European and farmer levels.
Activities shall coordinate ongoing efforts, include mutual identification of research and infrastructural gaps, identify a clear delineation between a core service and a downstream application and facilitate a cooperation of further research and development to be undertaken to reach sufficiently mature capacities for an operational integration as a subsequent step.
C – Preparation of a European capacity for improving forest monitoring
To advance in a coordinated preparation of a mature European capacity in this forest monitoring field, there is need to bring together the key European stakeholders and competent entities which are:
engaged in activities that can answer questions raised in and beyond the support to the REDD process;
have the ability to network with suitable research actors to fill the knowledge gaps;
have the required expertise to assess the needs for an end-to-end operational system at least on a scale of REDD region, with due attention to potential international cooperation opportunities for tackling this challenge from local to global levels.
At the same time, there is a need for an accompanying scientific and technical support to address:
How to improve Copernicus' ability to support forest management and sustainable logging, the evaluation of forest damage and disturbance, the detection of burned areas, the assessment of forest biomass and health in light of different scenarios including the availability of additional complementary data from space;
Identification of research gaps regarding integration/assimilation/utilization of space based data for forest monitoring, at global, European, national and local levels.
Activities shall coordinate ongoing efforts, include mutual identification of research and infrastructural gaps, identify a clear delineation between a core service and a downstream application and facilitate a cooperation of further research and development to be undertaken to reach sufficiently mature capacities for an operational integration as a subsequent step.
Both Copernicus Services Evolution and Copernicus Space Component Evolution should be taken into account and aligned optimally. While focusing primarily on the Services Evolution, the coherence between the space component and the service related requirements should also be ensured.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future""
Expected Impact:
Laying the foundation for complementing the existing Copernicus services and the current Copernicus observation capabilities for operational capacities for:
Arctic as a contribution to an integrated pan-Arctic observing system;
operational agriculture monitoring from local to global levels;
operational forest monitoring from local to global levels, respectively;
Improved the interaction in the context of the evolution of Copernicus with:
Europe's Climate Change challenge and Maritime activities and sustainable development in the Arctic;
Europe's Common Agriculture Policy, of Global Food Security Challenges, as well as farmer level support;
UN REDD process and associated policies, of EU Forest Strategy, as well as of the local forest manager needs;
Lay the foundation for the operational integration of all relevant European capacities as a subsequent step.

","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The overarching challenge is to prepare the next generation of the Copernicus Marine Service in line with the evolution of requirements, policies and national expectations and also benefiting from advances in space, IT technologies and modelling and in accordance with the Copernicus institutional context.
The Copernicus Marine Service has now entered in full-scale operations. It delivers in support to European policies, International conventions (i.e. on climate) and also in support to Member States, observations, forecasts and reanalysis of the past of the ocean, at global scale but also on all European regional seas. It delivers a unique, consistent and integrated overview from the open ocean up to the coasts both in terms of physics and biogeochemistry.
At policy level, many directives related to the marine environment call for integrating in a coherent way all EU policies (the Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directive, Maritime spatial Planning, etc...). EU Ministers have welcomed the Communication on International Ocean Governance, adopted by the Commission and the High Representative in November 2016, calling it a ""timely and relevant contribution to achieving […] better coordination and cooperation to ensure that oceans are safe, secure, conserved and sustainably used and managed."" Ministers stressed the urgent need for the EU and its Member States to step up efforts to protect the oceans and seas.
Hence, requirements from the coastal sector interested in integrated coastal zone management, spatial planning, natural risk mitigation, climate change impact mitigation or habitats and living resources monitoring were addressed. From the several improvement paths identified, a high priority is the evolution of Copernicus Marine Service global and regional systems to better describe ocean phenomenon with high dynamics at fine spatial scales to provide enhanced boundary conditions to coastal models (both physics, biogeochemistry or marine ecosystems) thus strengthening the links with downstream coastal monitoring activities from the public or private sectors.
Mesoscale to sub-mesoscale features such as fronts, meanders, internal waves eddies and filaments, as well as turbulent mixing are of fundamental importance for the exchanges of heat, fresh water, CO2, dissolved oxygen and nutrients between the surface and ocean interior, and in transition areas connecting the open ocean to coastal seas. The representation of tidal physics and wave-current interaction is also needed for a more complete representation of dynamical processes.
Small-scale dynamics is essential to better understand and represent ocean and climate interactions both for physics and biogeochemistry. Development of high-resolution global ocean models would also ultimately benefit to the development of higher resolution climate models needed for more skilful climate predictions.
The need for high-resolution global ocean models is also driven by the need for numerical models to develop a resolution capacity compliant with the spatial (and time) scales from present (Sentinels) and future EO satellites (e.g. wide-swath altimetry, geostationary sensors, surface currents).
Scope:
Numerical codes shall be prepared to achieve smallest target effective resolution in the kilometric range constrained by high-resolution EO datasets. The following activities are required:
Deliver global ocean analyses and forecasts at a kilometric scale with additional process complexity;
Production of ocean forecasts and analyses that exploit upcoming HR satellite datasets;
Develop advanced numerical schemes with improved accuracy and stability;
Exploit the opportunities of new high performance computing (HPC) technology;
Allow easy interfacing of the Copernicus service with local coastal models, allowing for two-way data exchange between coastal systems and the Copernicus Marine System;
Assess the impact of solving the ocean dynamics at kilometric scales on the role of ocean on climate (e.g. vertical exchange of heat, representation of over flows);
Assess the impact of solving the ocean dynamics at kilometric scales on the coupling with biogeochemistry and on the carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles.
Assess the adequacy and quality of satellite-derived ocean data into the coastal models, thus providing an opportunity for validation and integration with local ocean conditions.
A guidance document explaining the ongoing process to gather new user requirements is published together with this work programme[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future"".
Expected Impact:
Expected outcomes should be to:
Provide a significant contribution from the Science community to address the precedent list of unsolved issues related to a higher resolution of the ocean description;
Deliver developments based on the NEMO ocean model to easily transition to the Copernicus operational environment as this world-class ocean model already forms the basis of the majority of analysis and forecast products;
Prepare the necessary steps for further validation and integration into Copernicus and transition to operations;
Identify priorities for next developments both in EO processing, in-situ contribution (additional data sources), assimilation and modelling capacities;
Identify required coordination with other Copernicus services related to land, atmosphere or climate if so required;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus produces a wealth of data and information regarding the Earth sub-systems (land, atmosphere, oceans) and cross-cutting processes (climate change, emergency and security). The wealth of information delivered by the Copernicus operational programme is not fixed but needs to evolve further with recognised and emerging user requirements and state of the art methodologies. The potential for new products and applications needs to be exploited, especially as regards cross-cutting cases not yet realised. A process has been set-up by the Entrusted Entities, together with the Copernicus User Forum and Copernicus Programme Committee, operating the core services to review the evolution of the services and any emerging adaptation needs as to their urgency, closeness to the operational delivery process, and availability of capacities. Specific and well-targeted applications involving the outcome from multiple core services need to be developed in the mid-term. R&D activities are to be conducted such that results are available in a sufficiently timely manner to support an informed discussion, if and under which conditions the proposed new applications should be integrated into the operational service portfolio of the Copernicus programme. Furthermore proposers should highlight where results could also be valuable for GEO, considering Copernicus as the European contribution to this global initiative.
Scope:
Proposals shall demonstrate the technical operational feasibility of one specific cross-cutting thematic application. The proposers are expected to demonstrate that their proposal is relevant for the enhancement of Copernicus core services and capitalise from the corresponding product portfolio.
The output of this research and innovation action should provide a proof-of-concept or a prototype including a benchmarked selection of concurring methodological approaches, where feasible, that shall complement and broaden the panoply of information made currently available by the core services and which can act as reference for the independent assessment of Copernicus services evolution, in light of product extensions and service improvements.
These applications may concern areas in relation to domains such as energy, agriculture and forestry, health, water resources, security, natural environments and manmade disasters, resilience of built environment, cultural heritage, coastal monitoring, urban planning, climate adaptation, biodiversity and eco-system preservation, exploration and mineral resources, and others. Proposals are encouraged to use the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS), or other existing data access solutions instead of setting up their own download and processing infrastructure. They are also encouraged to integrate third-party data (including in-situ data) and envisage data assimilation into models and products made available on the Copernicus platform of the Copernicus services..
The proof-of-concept or prototype should allow demonstrating the relevance and suitability to implement the proposed application later on at European level in a cost efficient manner, i.e. potentially with operational Copernicus funding. To allow a discussion of such potential operational funding, the activity should also result in one or more possible scenarios on how this application could potentially be integrated into the existing service architecture.
Proposers are invited to investigate synergies with the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular Raw Materials and Climate[1].
Proposers are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general at http://copernicus.eu, the evolution topics identified there, the guidance document provided[2] together with this work programme, as well as the availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data available via the Commission’s website[3].
The proposal should:
Demonstrate to what extent the proposed evolution could be a candidate for the operational Copernicus service in terms of cost-benefits, calendar and operational feasibility;
Specify the conditions for making available, for use and exploitation, the results (including IPR) to the entities implementing the EU Copernicus programme, including its contractors and service providers;
Foster innovation and enhance applications which exploit Copernicus service information from across the service domain.
For proposals under this topic:
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged;
Coordination and partnership with KICs is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers is also encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.

Expected Impact:
Enable Copernicus services to better serve cross-cutting applications on European scale;
Enhance European industry’s potential to take advantage of emerging market opportunities and capacity to establish leadership in the field;
Reinforce the link with academic and scientific sector for scientific exploitation of Copernicus data;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus is a European system for monitoring the Earth. Copernicus consists of a complex set of systems which collect data from multiple sources: earth observation satellites and in situ sensors such as ground stations, airborne and sea-borne sensors. The processed data are made available to the users as reliable and up-to-date information through a set of services related to environmental and security issues. The services address six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency management and security. They support a wide range of applications, including environment protection, management of urban areas, regional and local planning, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, health, transport, climate change, sustainable development, civil protection and tourism.
A number of in-situ research infrastructures built by national or international programmes provide not only data of national interest, but also essential data for Copernicus. This is particularly true for observations done at global and European regional level. There is a need to develop mechanisms to help giving recognition to those observations by research infrastructures which support operational Copernicus services in meeting their objectives. In particular, in situ networks providing data for calibration and validation activities give a fundamental contribution to the Copernicus Services and the Copernicus Space component. It is therefore mandatory to map the requirements (type of measurements, geophysical parameters acquired, resolution in space and time, data uncertainty and quality, timeliness…) for in situ data and compare it to the existing observation system to find gaps.
The scope and potential of such contribution expands continually as research infrastructures evolve e.g. as European Research Infrastructures Consortium (ERICs), international partners gradually make their data available and as the relevance of no-space data is increasing in the context of Big Data applications.
Beyond the content generated by the infrastructures described above, most of them operate a bespoke and thus heterogenic IT infrastructure to collect, compute, store and distribute their data. Harmonisation and evolution initiatives are underway in the form of:
the cloud infrastructures (EOSC) providing access to any type of data as well as virtually unlimited data processing and preservation capacity;
the supercomputing facilities High Performance Computing (European Union HPC Strategy);
the pan-European GÉANT network for scientific excellence, research, education and innovation already use by ESA and EUMETSAT to distribute a large portion of the data provided by the different contributing missions;
the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) that offer access to Copernicus data and information alongside tools, storage and processing offerings.
At the same time there is also the need for a new, integrated and comprehensive Copernicus in-situ infrastructure which could be designed as an interface layer to make the collection of disparate observing networks (with different goals, methods, and governance) homogenously available to Copernicus users and operators in a cost-effective way.
The sustainability of in-situ observing systems remains a major concern, particularly at global and European level, and discontinued funding can pose a high risk for Copernicus.
There is a need to assess the current state of affairs in the areas described above and to propose a roadmap by establishing an inventory and performing an in-depth gap analyses in two main areas:
in-situ data and its use in Copernicus by looking in particular at identified areas where the operational Copernicus data and information provision could be improved;
On the basis of the work under 1, and taking into account the already ongoing initiatives in the IT domain, the areas where additional adaptations or additions to the currently implemented IT infrastructures would be needed or beneficial to facilitate the use of the related data within Copernicus.
Scope:
The main purpose of this action is to devise a sustainable and cost effective Copernicus products validation framework capable of meeting present and future requirements for data and information validation and quality enhancement delivered by Copernicus services and Space Component.
The proposal should take into account the on-going activities in the Copernicus in-situ component with the European Environmental Agency (EEA) as the Entity entrusted by the European Commission to coordinate and develop this fundamental Copernicus component[1].
The scope of this call encompasses the following steps:
Establish a complete inventory of the current and foreseen (when possible) use of in-situ data by the entities entrusted with the production and distribution of Copernicus data and information with a clear identification of the available and accessible in-situ and research data sources in Europe (at national, European or international level) and in the current and future non-European partner countries for Copernicus (US, Australia, South America, Africa, India).
Perform a gap analysis mapping the Copernicus needs versus the in-situ observations for the following activities:
sensor calibration (including vicarious calibration), algorithm calibration and products validation (mainly level 2 data) for the Copernicus space component, Sentinel and essential missions[2], present and future;
products validation for the Copernicus Services;
cross-cutting multi purposes products validation, not tailored on specific service or component.
Gaps shall be characterised as a minimum by identifying:
Missing data (completely or partially);
Data accuracy and uncertainty;
Procedural issues (such as delivery delay, obsolescence of the infrastructure, lower quality of data, automatic processing, standardization and coordination with Copernicus services).
For the identified in-situ infrastructures the following points should be analysed to help reveal any existing gaps:
the maturity level and missing steps to become operational for Copernicus (e.g. new design, pure research, pre-operational ….) and the priorities due to their impact on Copernicus;
the sustainability of the existing observations, update of observing infrastructure to cover missed parameters and improve the accuracy of the measurements and the IT specific needs e.g. connection to get the data, tools to exploit and process them, distributing data and products taking into account the already existing activities or projects like EOSC, HPC, GEANT and DIAS;
Related ongoing projects (H2020, ESA, JRC, EEA…) and their respective budget(s) when available.
Propose a priority list of elements to be addressed and a set of related research road-maps that allow addressing the identified gaps. This should include relevant inter-dependencies between research areas, such as:
Research into expansion of in-situ networks or improved in-situ data accuracy and quality, formats etc. to sustain and improve the Copernicus data and information veracity and accuracy;
Research into potential expansion of Copernicus and Copernicus-derived services building on additional in-situ resources and non-environmental data;
To propose a potential evolution of existing infrastructures as a Copernicus interface layer to make the collection of disparate observing networks homogenously available and accessible to the Copernicus users and operators;
Propose a detailed roadmap for the implementation of the Copernicus interface layer considering the different starting level: e.g. transition, new research, research to make them operational etc.
Proposals are expected to integrate relevant and knowledgeable actors from at least the four core domains covered by this topic:
Copernicus services
Copernicus space data providers
In-situ national and European (research-) infrastructures
European e-infrastructures
For proposals under this topic:
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers is also encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To complete a comprehensive overview of the status of research infrastructures already used by Copernicus;
To enable the identified research infrastructures to better respond to Copernicus operational needs;
To enable the identify missed in situ observation required to improve the accuracy of the satellite Copernicus products and monitor their quality in operation;
Reinforce the cooperation among different Copernicus actors (entrusted entities, space data providers, in-situ data providers and research infrastructures) on the in-situ data network.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to mature application-oriented technologies in the domains of Earth Observation (EO) which are expected to underpin competitiveness and contribute to the integration of space in society and economy.
The overarching objective is to improve the performance of EO systems, building on previous activities supported by the Union, Member States and ESA.
Activities in EO will focus on improving timeliness and reactivity of observations, their resolution and swath, the performance of sensors and the underlying technologies, while addressing the new challenges associated to larger data collection in remote sensing missions, including at ground segment level (e.g. massive data processing, machine learning, knowledge-based systems).
Moreover, some technologies and building blocks such as deployable antennas and/or (electrically) steerable antennas and mechanisms/structures, high mechanical/thermal stability aperture solutions, high efficiency power components, data processing and networks, or data links can provide synergies with SATCOM application domains.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to demonstrate, in a relevant environment, technologies, systems and sub-systems for Earth observation from satellites as well as from high altitude platforms. Proposals should demonstrate significant improvements in such areas as miniaturisation, power reduction, efficiency, versatility, and/or increased functionality, and should demonstrate at the viable extent complementarity to activities already funded by Member States and the European Space Agency. Proposals should also ensure system readiness for operational services and provide leverage on industry competitiveness, particularly on export markets.
Each proposal shall address only one of the following subtopics:
a) Very high resolution optical EO for LEO and/or high resolution optical EO for GEO/HEO instrument technologies, with focus on improving payload (e.g. radiometric and spectral parameters, spatial resolution, swath), including detectors, materials and solutions for stable and large optomechanical elements and systems (e.g. lightweight telescope mirrors with metre-level diameter) focal planes, wave front error and line of sight control, high performance actuators, multispectral filters for large focal plane;.
b) Competitive remote sensing instruments and space systems: innovations supporting readiness advancements for next generation systems in the optical and radio frequency domains (active/passive), technologies enabling advanced system solutions (including small satellites possibly in convoy with existing space assets), on-board image processing and detectors for video imaging with increased swath and resolution, technologies for super- and hyperspectral imaging instruments with high performance, radio occultation sensors, low cost high resolution telescopes and radar imaging systems;
c) Disruptive technologies for remote sensing, as technology building blocks for innovative LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and radar instruments (including cost-effective wide-swath altimetry and imaging systems), super-spectral and hyperspectral payloads with wide spectral and/or coverage, limb sounders and gravimetry payloads; high quantum efficiency photo detectors and high-precision optical beam scanning and pointing; advanced infrared (IR) technologies (optical filters, detectors and electronics);
d) On-board data processing: integrated multi-instrument on-board payload data processing for resource-constrained missions; solutions for high observation reactivity and real-time applications such as very high performance payload processing; on board data/image optimisation and compression for advanced video and image pre-processing as well as smart on-board data/image analysis; data flow optimisation for new missions, including impacts on the evolution of associated ground segment, for enhancement of overall processing power and speed over the full chain and for supporting massive data processing and machine learning in EO applications;
e) Advanced SAR/Radar technologies: step up maturity in new sensing concepts and technologies such as large and active antennas and reflectors, including multi-frequency concepts; enablers for digital beam-forming and beam-hopping interferometric systems, and for other concepts, such as large swath maritime surveillance radar, active sensing/processing of SAR ships, data fusion integration with new generation Automatic Identification Systems (AIS);
Low cost solutions based on components off the shelf (COTS) are encouraged.
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
Activities shall be complementary and create synergy with other European activities in the same domain.
To this end, proposals shall include the following tasks:
Analysis of relevant roadmaps, including roadmaps developed in the context of actions for the development of Key Enabling Technologies supported by the Union, and where available, roadmaps developed by the European Space Agency and European national space programmes;
Commercial assessment of the supply chain technology in the space or non-space domains and, if applicable, a business plan for commercialisation with a full range (preload) of recurring products.
The involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improvement in the capability, including through miniaturisation and power reduction, precision, efficiency or other characteristics with respect to existing Earth observation missions, opening new avenues for future space systems;
Substantial improvement in state-of-the-art technologies in key areas such as optical and radar systems, radio occultation sensors, sounders, LiDARs for Earth observation, and related key technologies, as for instance detectors and antennas;
Enabling synergic use of heterogeneous Earth Observation constellations;
Strengthening Europe's position in industrial competitiveness in technologies for Earth observation payloads and missions;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus operational services are not static, but need to evolve with recognised and emerging user requirements and EU policies.
R&D activities which are suitable for this call are identified to this end by the Commission, together with the Entrusted Entities, for each service. The challenge is to clearly demonstrate if and under which conditions an evolution of the operational service portfolio is appropriate and in line with the Copernicus Programme.
Scope:
The proposal should tackle only one of the following sub-topics. For the chosen sub-topic the proposal should clearly identify one (or more) core product(s) to be developed as a completely new or improved product.
The Commission, together with the Entrusted Entities, has identified for each service (sub-topic) the areas of Copernicus R&D interests:
Copernicus Emergency Monitoring Service (CEMS): resilience to climate risk, population exposure risk (e.g. in coastal areas, flood prone areas, areas exposed to droughts…). The proposed activities need to consider the existing CEMS framework and describe how they can contribute to a fully integrated risk cycle monitoring service
Copernicus Monitoring Atmosphere Service (CAMS): Up-to-date emissions of reactive gases and aerosol based on inverse modelling, Improve atmosphere monitoring using data assimilation and preparation for upcoming sentinels (with a focus on Sentinel-4), Integrated soil-vegetation-atmosphere modelling and data assimilation for representing emission and deposition of atmospheric pollutants.
Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): exploitation of seasonal forecasting systems as natural integrator of Copernicus Services, enhancement of predictive skills at seasonal timescales, consistent climate re-analysis of the Earth system, improvement in predicting variations of the climate system over the next few years and decades, linkages between current extreme weather events such as droughts, heat waves or floods to anthropogenic climate change and/or natural climate variability.
Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS): Advanced marine data assimilation techniques for physics (e.g. ensemble methods, assimilation of future satellite observations like swath altimetry and surface currents), improvement of biogeochemical products for the carbon cycle (CO2 ocean component), water quality and food security (food web modelling, habitats), with assimilation of satellite and in-situ data, improved biogeochemical models, coupled physics and biogeochemistry models and use of new in-situ observations (e.g. BGC Argo) to validate biogeochemical models.
Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS): essential ecosystem variables for natural capital accounting, HRL for agriculture, forest and urban monitoring, CLC+, environmental compliance, support to sustainable development goals, exploitation of mid and high resolution satellite combination for continuous environmental change monitoring.
Security New concepts for applications based on the integration of relevant information derived from space or non-space sources, current services or other value-added applications, targeted to support civil protection and security. New algorithms for automated monitoring and detection of changes and patterns of life. Those activities should also aim at bridging the gap between demand and supply, complementing the offer of the Copernicus Security services and enlarging its user base.
Actions should take into account the existing portfolio of the services and clearly define to what extent main model, algorithm, tool and technique should be improved to generate new or better products.
Actions aim at demonstrating the technical operational feasibility of the selected product(s).
The proposed development should be modular and scalable. The project should provide a proof-of-concept or a prototype (e.g. system element) demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service. This new “system element” should also guarantee the expandability required for the integration of new data from potential space or no-space new mission/sensors.
During the development of the project, the team taking into account the delineation between Copernicus core services and downstream services, should clearly identify the right context of the proposed product(s). The border delineation takes into account the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the avoidance of duplication, and the facilitation of user uptake.
The proposal should also investigate to what extent the proposed evolution could be a candidate for the operational Copernicus service in terms of cost-benefits, calendar and operational feasibility.
R&D activities should aim at a better integration of space research with other non-space domains (e.g citizen science including social media) focusing in particular on policy areas addressing global and societal challenges highlighting horizontal synergies and multidisciplinary approaches. In particular, proposals should clearly mention which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals the project will support.
New IT tools should be considered and innovative solutions should be proposed for a better data exploitation, processing and distribution, e.g.: cloud and HPC computing, distributed computing, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning (e.g. for automatic feature recognition), ensemble modelling, model coupling & nesting, software as-a-service.
Additionally, the operationalisation of the research results should receive active attention during the course of the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future, including the conditions for making available, for re-use and exploit the results (including IPR) to the entities implementing the EU Copernicus programme. The software should be open licensed in order to use, copy, study, and change it in any way.
Proposers are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general at https://www.copernicus.eu/en, the availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data at the Commission’s website (https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data).
It should be noted that funding of the H2020 project in no way commits the Commission or the Copernicus service operators to deploy the outcomes from the research in the Copernicus operational services.
For proposals under this topic:
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers and promotion of gender balance is also encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
At least one proposal per sub-topic shall be selected for funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased coverage of EU policies, clearly identifying which and how the project intends to address them;
Integration of different observation capacities with a clear demonstration of an increase in the service performance (compared with the existing one);
The proposed proof-of-concept or prototype, as outcome of the project, should clearly demonstrate an improvement of the Copernicus service evolution.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Complementing the global challenges outlined above, the following technology-specific challenges have to be addressed in 2014:
Photovoltaics: Accelerating the development of the EU Inorganic Thin-Film (TF) industry – Inorganic TF technologies offer new application possibilities and additional benefits, such as flexibility, low weight, partial transparency, better low-irradiance performance, short energy pay-back time, and integrated manufacturing. To fully benefit from these, however, TF technologies need to achieve module efficiencies higher than 12-16% (depending on the technology) while developing low-cost, high-volume manufacturing routes.
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): Improving the flexibility and predictability of CSP generation – The major asset of the CSP technology is to be able to produce predictable power, which provides the flexibility to adapt the demand from the grid. Only a few CSP technologies allowing this predictability have reached commercial maturity. The challenge is to demonstrate solutions that can significantly improve the dispatchability of CSP plants.
Wind energy: Demonstrating and testing of new nacelle and rotor prototypes - There is a need for demonstration and testing of new nacelle and rotor prototypes with a significant lower mass and material intensity and applicable to several types of large-scale wind turbines.
Ocean energy[1]: Demonstration of ocean energy technologies - Demonstrate advanced full scale devices in real world conditions in order to gain further understanding and certainty over installation, operations and decommissioning costs, as well as of high levels of reliability and survivability.
Renewable Heating and Cooling
Shallow geothermal energy: Improved vertical borehole drilling technologies to enhance safety and reduce costs – Shallow geothermal energy systems are ideally suited to meet the ambitious energy saving targets of the EU. They can provide heating and/or cooling or both. Further improvement of the efficiency of shallow geothermal systems and reduction of installation costs are needed to increase deployment of these geothermal systems for the heating & cooling market.
Scope: The proposals should address one or more of the specific technology challenges described above bringing the proposed technology solutions to a higher TRL level, aiming at “demonstration” of these solutions, accompanied, where appropriate, by supporting research activities and activities targeting market uptake. The proposals should bring the proposed technology solutions from TRL 5-6 to TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Technical issues, synergies between technologies, regional approaches, socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (including public acceptance, business cases, pre-normative and legal issues, pollution and recycling) need to be appropriately addressed where relevant.
Environment, health and safety issues should be considered in all demonstrations and appropriately addressed.
An important element for the entire area of renewables will be the need for an increased understanding of risks in each area (whether technological, in business processes, for particular business cases, or otherwise), risk ownership, and possible risk mitigation. Proposals shall therefore include appropriate work packages on this matter.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators and expected impacts. Industrial involvement in the consortia and explicit exploitation plans are a prerequisite. All proposals will have to include a work package on ’the business case’ of the technology solution being addressed. This work package has to demonstrate the business case of the technology solution and has to identify potential issues of public acceptance, market and regulatory barriers including standardisation needs, financing and other supply-side issues of relevance. It should also address, where appropriate, synergies between technologies (including those for storage), regional approaches and other socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (e.g. pollution and recycling). The current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Annex to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the advances in the TRL that will be undertaken in the proposal should also be indicated to ensure the potential for exploitation.
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Technological innovation related to the integration of renewable generation in the industrial and residential sectors can be addressed in the Energy Efficiency call or Smart Cities and Communities call. Improving the energy efficiency of district heating and cooling networks is addressed in the Energy Efficiency call.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to have one or more of the general impacts listed below:
    Bringing costs of renewable energy down by increasing technology performance, decreasing costs of production, installation time and costs, decreasing of operation and maintenance costs, and increasing reliability and lifetime.
    Reducing life-cycle environmental impact.
    Improving EU energy security.
     Making variable renewable electricity generation more predictable and grid friendly,  thereby allowing larger amounts of variable output renewable sources in the grid.
   Increasing the attractiveness of renewable heating and cooling technologies by improving cost-competitiveness, reducing complexity and increasing reliability.
      Nurturing the development of the industrial capacity to produce components and systems and opening of new opportunities.
       Strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.
       Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.

The targeted technology readiness levels (TRL) will range typically between 5 and 8 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Proposals will indicate the estimated levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
The proposed solutions should be demonstrated in large scale pilots and validated in real life conditions when possible or on real data if by simulation for a period of time ensuring credibility and consistency of conclusions. The funding should be primarily intended to be used to finance integration and coordination aspects; the need to fund hardware such as smart meters, storage devices, etc. should be duly justified in the proposals (Annex 1 and 2).
Proposals will include a detailed analysis of current regulations, standards and interoperability/interfaces issues applying to their case, in particular in connection to ongoing work in the Smart Grid Task Force and its Experts Groups in the field of Standardization (e.g. CEN-CLC-ETSI M/490), regulatory environment for privacy, data protection[1], cyber security, smart grid deployment, infrastructure and industrial policy (http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters/smart-grids-task-force).
Cost/benefit analysis, business models and plans for replication must be part of the proposed work.
Proposals will also foresee coordination with similar EU-funded projects (in particular those which will be funded under this call) in particular for policy relevant issues such as regulatory framework, business models, obstacles to innovation. It is recommended to reserve of the order of 2% of the EU funding for these activities. A Coordination and Support Action is foreseen for the organisation of this collaboration in this Work Programme (see Topic LCE-3-2016).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 12 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals must demonstrate that they are relevant, compatible with the broad EU energy policy context such as Climate-Energy packages, Energy Union. Where relevant, they should also indicate if and how they will contribute to:
ongoing policy developments in the field of the design of the internal electricity market, of the retail market, ongoing discussions on self-consumption,
enhanced interconnections between Member States and/or between energy networks.
Proposals will demonstrate contributing to the following overall impacts:
The EU power network will be capable of integrating large share of renewables exceeding 50% by 2030, in particular variable energy sources, in a stable and secure way
EU based companies will be able to deliver adequate competitive product and services on the market in 2-5 years after the end of the project
The demonstrated solutions have the potential to be scaled (if needed) and replicated
Proposals will also demonstrate if and how they contribute to the following more specific expected impacts:
Competitive demand response schemes for the benefit of the grid and the consumers
Validated contributions for improved, stability and flexibility in the distribution grid, avoid congestion; enabling near real-time pan European energy balancing market;
Emergence of new services provided by storage systems to the distribution grid and the consumers/prosumers at affordable costs, deferral of investments in grid reinforcement,
Conversion of excess electricity, avoid curtailment, provide services to the grid
Creation of synergies with transport users (e.g. services to the grid with smart charging) / support the decarbonisation of transport.
Finally, proposals will also include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice which could be used to assess the progress during the project life.

","Innovation action
","10 December 2014
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
In 2015,the following technology-specific challenges have to be addressed:
Photovoltaics: PV integrated in the built environment – Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems will become essential elements in future net zero energy buildings provided a number of challenges are solved, e.g. integration with other functional building components, flexibility in system design, architectural and aesthetic considerations and standardisation, smart interaction with the grid, extension of the lifetime of system components, and cost reduction.
Wind energy: Demonstrating innovative substructure and floating concepts - There is a need for i) demonstration of innovative bottom-fixed substructure concepts for water depths of 30 to 50m capable of reducing costs; and ii) demonstration of innovative floating wind turbine concepts.
Ocean energy[1]: Demonstration of ocean energy technologies - Demonstrate advanced full scale devices in real world conditions in order to gain further understanding and certainty over installation, operations and decommissioning costs, as well as of high levels of reliability and survivability.
Deep geothermal energy: Testing of enhanced geothermal systems in different geological environments – Widespread deployment of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) needs new and improved models and innovative solutions are needed to routinely create EGS reservoirs with sufficient permeability, fracture orientation and spacing. Cross-fertilisation with hydrothermal fields and cross-fertilisation with tight oil and gas fields can be explored.
Renewable Heating and Cooling:
Demonstration of solar technologies for residential and non-residential buildings - The use of solar energy for the production of domestic hot water and for space heating needs to increase to make full use of this renewable energy source. Innovative and cost-effective solutions in terms of components and system design and with a higher share of heating supplied by solar energy need to be demonstrated.
Scope: The proposals should address one or more of the specific technology challenges described above bringing the proposed technology solutions to a higher TRL level, aiming at “demonstration” of these solutions, accompanied, where appropriate, by supporting research activities and activities targeting market uptake. The proposals should bring the proposed technology solutions from TRL 5-6 to TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Technical issues, synergies between technologies, regional approaches, socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (including public acceptance, business cases, pre-normative and legal issues, pollution and recycling) need to be appropriately addressed where relevant.
Environment, health and safety issues should be considered in all demonstrations and appropriately addressed.
An important element for the entire area of renewables will be the need for an increased understanding of risks in each area (whether technological, in business processes, for particular business cases, or otherwise), risk ownership, and possible risk mitigation. Proposals shall therefore include appropriate work packages on this matter.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators and expected impacts. Industrial involvement in the consortia and explicit exploitation plans are a prerequisite. All proposals will have to include a work package on ’the business case’ of the technology solution being addressed. This work package has to demonstrate the business case of the technology solution and has to identify potential issues of public acceptance, market and regulatory barriers including standardisation needs, financing and other supply-side issues of relevance. It should also address, where appropriate, synergies between technologies (including those for storage), regional approaches and other socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (e.g. pollution and recycling). The current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Annex to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the advances in the TRL that will be undertaken in the proposal should also be indicated to ensure the potential for exploitation.
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Technological innovation related to the integration of renewable generation in the industrial and residential sectors can be addressed in the Energy Efficiency call or Smart Cities and Communities call. Improving the energy efficiency of district heating and cooling networks is addressed in the Energy Efficiency call.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to have one or more of the general impacts listed below:
Bringing costs of renewable energy down by increasing technology performance, decreasing costs of production, installation time and costs, decreasing of operation and maintenance costs, and increasing reliability and lifetime.
Reducing life-cycle environmental impact.
Improving EU energy security.
Making variable renewable electricity generation more predictable and grid friendly, thereby allowing larger amounts of variable output renewable sources in the grid.
Increasing the attractiveness of renewable heating and cooling technologies by improving cost-competitiveness, reducing complexity and increasing reliability.
Nurturing the development of the industrial capacity to produce components and systems and opening of new opportunities.
Strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.
Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.

The new structure of the SET-Plan[1] identifies the following Integrated Challenges: Active consumer at the centre of the energy system, Demand focus – increasing energy efficiency across the energy system, System optimisation, Secure, cost-effective, clean and competitive supply as well as some Cross-Cutting aspects. A novel approach to R&I strategy in the field smart grid and storage is needed to address these integrated energy challenges.
Scope:
Proposals must put forward a convincing framework to tackle all the following issues:
Support to the coordination of stakeholder views on R&I strategy using existing structures such as the Smart Grid Technology Platform, the EEGI, EERA, etc., taking into account the structure of Set-Plan the possible coming evolutions of the Set-Plan and Integrated Roadmap governance. Provision should be made to organise 2 plenary meetings per year.
Analysis of the on-going research, demonstration and innovation projects in the EU and countries associated to Horizon 2020 and where possible/relevant at Member States (e.g. thanks to link with national technology platforms) and regional levels;
Support for the development of a R&I roadmap based on the analysis of ongoing projects and taking into account relevant processes for the consolidation of stakeholders views;
Organisation of 2 workshops per year in Brussels to enhance collaboration between projects and to establish synergies on policy related aspects (e.g., business models, regulatory framework, financing framework, etc.) of the Horizon 2020 funded projects in the field of smart grid and storage;
Propose and organise workshops and processes for enhanced cross border knowledge sharing and system optimisation.
The support framework will be capable of hosting a representative set of stakeholders covering the following aspects: generation, transmission, distribution, smart metering, consumers and the following sectors: industry, research centres and academia. Direct (as a beneficiary) or indirect (e.g. under the form of a letter of intent) commitments of stakeholders in the proposal constitute an added value.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Only one proposal will be selected.
The recommended duration of this activity is 48 months.
Expected Impact:
Proposals will demonstrate contributing to enhance the efficiency of R&I policy making at EU level. In particular, proposers will demonstrate how and why they are best paced to support the stakeholder's community; their experience in supporting the development of R&I roadmaps, their capacity to organise stakeholders/EU funded projects events while creating output for policy making.

","Coordination and support action
","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The legal framework established by the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC, 'RES Directive')) sets binding targets for all Member States to contribute to the overall 20% target for renewable energy in the EU final energy consumption by 2020, and the 'Energy Roadmap 2050' shows that renewables will have to play a much greater role in all future scenarios beyond 2020. As well as putting in place legal obligations, the RES Directive also makes recommendations for specific actions to be taken by the public and private sectors across the EU.  However, in many areas, it leaves open the ways in which Member States may implement policies and support measures aiming to increase use of renewable energy at national, regional and local level. 
Consequently, although some Member States have already made good progress in incentivising renewable energy, there are still many opportunities for common learning and sharing of best practices on the cost-effective mobilisation of new investments in renewable energy across the EU.  Moreover, such investments contribute to the European 2020 strategy for growth, job creation, industrial innovation, and technological leadership as well as reducing emissions, improving the security of energy supplies and reducing EU’s energy import dependence.
Since the adoption of RES Directive in 2009, most Member States have experienced significant growth in renewable energy consumption. However, currently, we are seeing a deceleration of this growth, partly due to the economic crisis, but also because there are a number of market uptake barriers that remain or persist for both established and innovative renewable energy technologies.
Scope: To ensure the level of growth needed to deliver the EU targets for renewable energy, and to create the appropriate business environment for EU industrial leadership in low-carbon energy technologies, a number of important market-uptake challenges still need to be addressed, notably:
                     Ensuring sustained public acceptance of renewable energy projects and renewable energy overall, while taking into account the implications of the substantial increase in RES share in the final energy consumption;
                     Ensuring speedy and user friendly permitting procedures;
                     Implementing renewable energy policies, codes and legislations at EU, national, regional and local levels in a coordinated manner using best practice examples with significant replication potential;
                     Capacity building and contributing to the further development of renewable energy policy, legislation and regulation, and informing the debate on post-2020 horizons;
                     Capacity building and facilitating the deployment of improved business models and innovative financing schemes for mobilising investments in innovative and established renewable energy systems and services.
Proposals should address one or several of the challenges mentioned above for technologies and systems which are at TRL 7-9 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Regional specificities, socio-economic, spatial and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective shall be considered.  For all actions, the consortia should involve and/or engage relevant stakeholders and market actors who are committed to adopting/implementing the results.
For RES electricity, actions which address exchanges of information or cooperation among different actors (e.g. on future business models for aggregators), must demonstrate that they are promoting best practices. Actions which are developing new recommendations or which are contributing to the debate on costs and benefits of specific options must provide quantified indicators of the market impacts of future policy options.
For RES heating and cooling, proposals must demonstrate that they are adopting an integrated approach which fully respects the requirements and recommendations given in the energy efficiency and EPBD directives.  Actions aimed at promoting the use of geothermal, bio and/or solar heating for individual, industrial or district heating applications must involve / engage with the responsible policy makers and regulators as well as industry and potential financing bodies, and must include relevant capacity building and adoption of best practices.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Increasing the share of renewable electricity, heating and cooling in the final energy consumption. Reductions in the time taken to authorise the construction of renewable energy plants and related infrastructure. Substantial and measurable reductions in the transaction costs for project developers as well as for the permitting authorities, whilst still fully addressing the needs for environmental impact assessments and public acceptance. Development of better policy, regulatory, market support and financing frameworks, including at regional and local level.

","Research and Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","23 September 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Complementing the global challenges outlined above, the following technology-specific challenges have to be addressed in 2014:
Photovoltaics: Developing next generation high performance PV cells and modules – Highly efficient, novel PV concepts, need to be developed based e.g. on advanced materials and processes, and/or innovative approaches to light management and solar spectrum matching/modification. The challenge is to bring practical performance close to theoretical limits.
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): Making CSP plants more cost competitive – Increasing the efficiency and reducing the construction, operation and maintenance costs of CSP plants are the main challenges. Innovative solutions and concepts are necessary in order to increase plant performance and reduce cost through improved components, improved plant control and operation, and innovative plant configurations.
Wind energy: Develop control strategies and innovative substructure concepts - There is a need for i) control strategies and systems for new and/or large rotors and wind farms (on- and offshore); ii) new innovative substructure concepts, including floating platforms, to reduce production, installation and O&M costs for water depths of more than 50m.
Ocean energy [1]: Develop emerging designs and components – Innovative designs and components are needed to ensure efficient and effective long-term cost reduction as well as to achieve high levels of reliability and survivability for at least 20 years in harsh conditions.
Hydropower: Boosting peak power through sustainable hydropower – Existing hydropower stations need refurbishment and this opportunity should be used to modernise the power plants. Therefore, innovative and improved turbines or generators and related main equipment having a more robust design allowing operation in a wider range of heads and loads to increase power output, improve efficiency and dynamics should be developed.
Deep geothermal energy: Development of new drilling technologies and concepts for geothermal energy – New drilling technologies and concepts are necessary to increase the number of economically viable geothermal resources, including in hard rock and high temperature/pressure conditions, and have a demonstrably smaller environmental footprint by comparison to existing drilling methodologies. Cross-fertilisation with hydrothermal oil and gas technologies and operations shall be explored.
Renewable Heating and Cooling:
Solar cooling systems[2] – Solar cooling systems reliability remains uncertain causing high installation and operation costs and hampering acceptance. Innovative solutions are needed to reduce the complexity of the installation, to improve components performance and reliability, and to ensure cost reductions.
Improving efficiency of biomass CHP systems while widening the feedstock base[3] – Micro and small-scale CHP (0.5-250 kW and 0.25-1 MW input power respectively) have a high potential for heat and electricity production for decentralized applications. Cost effective, robust and environmentally friendly micro and small-scale CHP systems with high thermal and electrical efficiency need to be developed allowing the use of solid, liquid or gaseous sustainable biomass feedstock, such as agricultural and forest residues, upgraded solid or liquid bioenergy carriers with higher energy density, industrial by-products and biogas/biomethane.
Scope: Proposals should address one or more of the technology-specific challenges described above, including between renewables areas, where new, innovative ideas are welcome. They should bring technology solutions to a higher TRL, from TRL 3-4 to 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Technical issues, synergies between technologies, regional approaches, socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (including public acceptance, business cases, pre-normative and legal issues, pollution and recycling) need to be appropriately addressed where relevant.
Environment, health and safety issues shall be considered in all developments and appropriately addressed.
An important element for the entire area of renewables will be the need for an increased understanding of risks in each area (whether technological, in business processes, for particular business cases, or otherwise), risk ownership, and possible risk mitigation. Proposals shall therefore include appropriate work packages on this matter.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators, expected impacts, as well as provide for development of explicit exploitation plans. Proposals should also indicate the current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Annex to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the advances in the TRL that will be undertaken in the proposal to ensure the potential for exploitation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Technological innovation related to the integration of renewable generation in the industrial and residential sectors can be addressed in the Energy Efficiency call or Smart Cities and Communities call. Improving the energy efficiency of district heating and cooling networks is addressed in the Energy Efficiency call.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to have one or more of the general impacts listed below:
     Significantly increased technology performance.
     Reducing life-cycle environmental impact.
     Improving EU energy security.
     Making variable renewable electricity generation more predictable and grid friendly, thereby allowing larger amounts of variable output renewable sources in the grid.
   Increasing the attractiveness of renewable heating and cooling technologies by improving cost-competitiveness, reducing complexity and increasing reliability.
     Bringing cohesion, coherence and strategy in the development of new renewable energy technologies.
     Nurturing the development of the industrial capacity to produce components and systems and opening of new opportunities.
      Strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.
       Reducing renewable energy technologies installation time and costs.
       Increasing the reliability and lifetime while decreasing operation and maintenance costs.
       Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.

Concentrated Solar Power (CSP): Improving the environmental profile of the CSP technology – CSP plants rely on water for cleaning the reflecting surfaces, for power generation and for cooling. Innovative solutions are needed to significantly reduce or replace the water consumption while maintaining the overall efficiency of the CSP plants, and limiting their environmental impact.
Wind energy: Substantially reduce the costs of wind energy - There is a need for innovative integrated dedicated offshore systems (e.g. with a significant lower mass per unit power installed) to reduce production, installation and O&M costs for water depths of more than 50m.
Ocean energy [1]:  Ensure efficiency and effective long term cost reduction and high levels of reliability and survivability - There is a need to gather experience in open sea operating conditions, structural and power performance and operating data of emerging full scale wave and tidal energy convertors and components in single and/or multiple device configuration. For the overall development cycle a better resource assessment is needed as well.
Hydropower: Increasing flexibility of hydropower – Hydropower is still amongst the largest sources of renewable energy. The challenge is however to make hydropower in the >100MW range available in a time as short as possible. New technologies need to be developed to increase ramping rates and to allow start-stop-cycles to reach up to 30 times per day depending on head and volume, while lifetime of components and respective life time prediction methods under heavy-duty operating conditions are considerably improved while avoiding adverse effects on downstream water courses.
Deep geothermal energy: Development of new technologies and concepts for geothermal energy - New technologies and concepts for geothermal energy are necessary to increase the number of economically viable geothermal resources, including in hard rock and high temperature/pressure conditions, and to have a demonstrably smaller environmental footprint to existing technologies. Cross-fertilisation with hydrothermal oil and gas technologies and operations shall be explored.
Renewable Heating and Cooling:
Solar heating for industrial processes[2]– The potential benefit of using solar heat above 200°C in industrial processes has been already acknowledged. Innovative concepts, processes and technologies for these applications are needed which can be easily integrated into existing industrial plants and processes.
Improving efficiency of low emission biomass heating systems while widening the feedstock base[3] – Current residential-scale boilers can combust only one type of feedstock (e.g. wood chips, wood pellets). New flexible and robust residential-scale low emission boilers for heat applications need to be developed using a wider range of sustainable feedstock (including mixtures) with high ash content such as agricultural and forest residues, upgraded solid or liquid bioenergy carriers with higher energy density and industrial by-products.
Scope: Proposals should address one or more of the technology-specific challenges described above, including between renewables areas, where new, innovative ideas are welcome. They should bring technology solutions to a higher TRL, from TRL 3-4 to 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Technical issues, synergies between technologies, regional approaches, socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective (including public acceptance, business cases, pre-normative and legal issues, pollution and recycling) need to be appropriately addressed where relevant.
Environment, health and safety issues shall be considered in all developments and appropriately addressed.
An important element for the entire area of renewables will be the need for an increased understanding of risks in each area (whether technological, in business processes, for particular business cases, or otherwise), risk ownership, and possible risk mitigation. Proposals shall therefore include appropriate work packages on this matter.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators, expected impacts, as well as provide for development of explicit exploitation plans. Proposals should also indicate the current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Appendix to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the advances in the TRL that will be undertaken in the proposal to ensure the potential for exploitation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Technological innovation related to the integration of renewable generation in the industrial and residential sectors can be addressed in the Energy Efficiency call or Smart Cities and Communities call. Improving the energy efficiency of district heating and cooling networks is addressed in the Energy Efficiency call.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to have one or more of the general impacts listed below:
                     Significantly increased technology performance.
                     Reducing life-cycle environmental impact.
                     Improving EU energy security.
                     Making variable renewable electricity generation more predictable and grid friendly, thereby allowing larger amounts of variable output renewable sources in the grid.
                     Increasing the attractiveness of renewable heating and cooling technologies by improving cost-competitiveness, reducing complexity and increasing reliability.
                     Bringing cohesion, coherence and strategy in the development of new renewable energy technologies.
                     Nurturing the development of the industrial capacity to produce components and systems and opening of new opportunities.
                     Strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.
                     Reducing renewable energy technologies installation time and costs.
                     Increasing the reliability and lifetime while decreasing operation and maintenance costs.
                     Contributing to solving the global climate and energy challenges.

Specific challenge:This topic will address the need to progress energy storage and reduce the barriers associated with new storage concepts integrated into the distribution grid and at building/house level. For local storage applications, addressed in this topic, it is desirable to include the interaction between the electricity grid and other energy uses such as the district heating/cooling network, CHP, micro-generation, local renewables and to include the most advanced ICT for optimising the whole system. Seen the various barriers that energy storage is facing, the activities under this topic should include the anticipation of potential market and regulatory issues with due consideration to the social, socioeconomic aspects and improved models to demonstrate energy storage systems.
Scope: Activities should focus on integrating solutions that reached already TRL 5 to TRL 6 and above (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The direct/indirect storage must take into account grid interfaces and synergies between electricity, heating/cooling and final applications when they enable a clear benefit to be validated in this context. When appropriate, synergies between technologies could be used. The direct/indirect storage must take into account of grid interfaces and synergies between electricity, heating/cooling and final applications when they enable a clear benefit to be validated in this context. When appropriate, synergies between technologies could be used. LCA and economic assessments of the investigated systems should be refined.
The priority is:
                     Demonstration and performance verification of electrochemical and other storage technologies that are connected with low voltage substations or variable distributed electricity generation or in individual houses. This would include community storage systems in residential areas or storage in industrial parks. The activities should include issues on safety, socioeconomic and business models. For islands with insufficient or no grid connection, the integration aspects with all energy vectors/grids shall have very high priority.
                     Demonstration and performance verification of compact electricity-grid connected heat and cold storage systems with enhanced performance. This would include integrated systems with e.g. heat pumps and/or micro CHP or the integration of existing heating/cooling grid storage with the electricity grid.
                     Demonstration proposals shall include market uptake measures for integrating energy storage in the electricity network and power system managementand cost-benefit analyses of the possible uses of the technology seen from a system perspective.
                     All projects will have to perform a detailed cost-benefit analysis and operational optimization of storage.
This topic addresses stationary/movable storage; integration of electric vehicles in the grid is expected to be addressed under other calls. The performance of market-ready technologies, with TRL 7 or above, may be verified through technology verification schemes such as EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) pilot programme[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to:
Demonstrate the technical and economic synergy between local storage (ideally of several energy vectors), smart grid management, demand response and their integration with advanced ICT.
Demonstration of the integration of storage services in network management, particularly exploiting storage with electronic interfaces to facilitate the integration and back-up of highly variable renewable generation and dispersed demand response.
Increase the grid security and stability, and reduce grid congestion e.g. through appropriate integration with ICT tools for the control and management of electricity networks.
Increase the potential for new grid supporting services (balancing and ancillary services) linked with the availability of storage.
Enhanced supply independence of remote areas by means of local renewable energy generation and storage.
The impacts are expected to be linked to either energy balancing, increased grid security and stability or improved grid congestion management at local level.
Cover a wider use of storage technologies in the energy system through validation of solutions with reduced cost, increased efficiencies, and lower environmental impact.
Accelerating innovation and business models for deployment of storage at local level.
Deferred investment for grid reinforcements and lower societal costs associated with high penetration of distributed variable renewable energy resources.
The impacts are expected to be linked to either energy balancing or improved grid congestion management at local level.

Specific challenge:The high penetration rates of variable renewable energy resources entail the need for large scale energy storage to balance the production and consumption of high quantities of electricity and during longer time periods. Demonstration activities in this topic will aim to progress large scale energy storage and reduce the barriers associated with new storage concepts. An important market uptake challenge is to reduce the barriers (technological, economic, regulatory, environmental, social and other acceptance, etc.) associated with the deployment of existing or new storage concepts.
Scope: Activities should focus on storage systems that reached already TRL 5 and bring them to TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes). This would include anticipation of potential market and regulatory issues with due consideration to the environmental and socioeconomic aspects and improved models to demonstrate energy storage systems.
Activities should pursue direct electricity or indirect storage (electricity with other energy vectors). The activities must address the interfaces for integrating storage in grid management. Where appropriate, synergies between electricity grid, other energy grids, storage and final energy use must be taken into account.
Integrated Power to Gas concepts allowing electricity storage through the production of synthetic gas to be stored in the gas grid in the form of synthetic/green methane are eligible. Electrolysis proposals and proposals with pure hydrogen injection in the natural gas grid are not in the scope of this activity; they should be submitted to the Hydrogen/fuel cells joint undertaking.
The priorities are demonstration and validation of:
-       pumped hydro storage in new locations such as underground storage concepts, storage using seawater or similar concepts addressing large scale applications aiming at GWh scale;
-       storage with compressed air, liquid air, and similar concepts aiming at the large scale (ideally > 100 MWh scale if appropriate);
-       retrofitting of existing hydro dams with pumped hydro or other storage to enable flexible operation, large scale balancing and storage, while applying environmentally friendly design and operation;
-       integrated management of existing or retrofitted pumped hydro storage (with variable speed pumps/turbines) also across national borders (e.g. smart grid concepts across alpine (or other) borders and enclosing many existing facilities);
-       linking such storage projects with the development of the Northern Seas, Mediterranean ring and other Trans-European grid infrastructure concepts may be envisaged.
Demonstration proposals should include market uptake measures for integrating energy storage in the electricity network and power system management. They shall focus on a limited set of specific issues that currently prevent an up-scaling or the realization of the concept. They should also include research on environmental, economic, legal, societal and public acceptance issues and recommendations for future energy policy by the industrial stakeholders involved. These results should be compared with the results of research oriented projects on the same or similar topics.
All projects will have to perform a detailed cost-benefit analysis and operational optimization of storage.
Organising targeted practice-oriented education and training activities at the project's pilot or demonstration facilities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 16 to 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Much of the R&D efforts in recent years have focused on the development of high-efficiency PV cells at low cost. However, the cost of a PV system also depends on a number of other elements and components.

Scope:
Proposals are requested to address the reduction of the cost of PV electricity by optimising the PV system energy yield and lifetime and decreasing cost at module (encapsulation materials, glass, and antireflective layers, anti-soiling layers, module architecture, etc.), balance-of-system component (electronics, inverters, tracking systems, etc.) or system configuration levels.

Specific challenge:Decarbonising the transport sector is a major challenge in the global fight against climate change. As such, it is a crucial element in the EU Energy Roadmap 2050 and in the Brazilian National Policy for Climate Change.
In the short-term and medium-term perspective, biofuels are expected to be the main contributors to this de-carbonisation. In order to achieve the EU and Brazil policy targets in this domain, and to address concerns regarding environmental impacts of biofuels, new and advanced biofuels using sustainable feedstock need to reach the market.
Brazil is an essential partner in this sector: it has outstanding expertise, a well-established and highly competitive first-generation industry, as well as optimal conditions for the development of an advanced biofuel industry.
Hence in the framework of the EU-Brazil S&T Cooperation Agreement, the European Commission representing the European Union and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) of the Government of Brazil are working together to benefit from the complementarities in research and innovation, in order to foster the development of advanced biofuels and accelerate their commercialisation both in Brazil and in Europe.
The advanced biofuel technologies to reach first commercial maturity will most likely be linked to and find its basis on the current production systems with high economic and environmental performance, such as the sugarcane based ethanol. The joint work should thus focus on the development of advanced biofuel technologies that can be integrated in existing sugarcane-based biofuel processes.
To this end, the following sub-challenges should be addressed:
Exploiting synergies between Brazil and Europe in terms of scientific expertise, industrial capacity and resources.
Proving that the integration of advanced biofuels technologies into existing sugarcane ethanol plants is technically feasible, cost competitive and environmentally and socio-economically sustainable at commercial scale. Joint work should build upon the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol model, and benefit from the Brazilian and European experience in biofuels.
Developing or improving logistic systems for a sound and sustainable feedstock supply.
Scope: Proposals should address the first sub-challenge presented above, and at least one of the other two. They should bring technology solutions to a higher TRL level.
Proposals should aim at moving technologies that reached already TRL 4-6 to TRL 5-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes) through industrial demonstration projects, which may include supporting R&D activities if needed.
Biofuels produced from starch, sugar and oil fractions of food/feed crops are excluded.
All proposals have to include a work package on ’the business case’ of the technology solution being addressed. That work package has to demonstrate the business case of the technology and identify potential issues of public acceptance, market and regulatory barriers, including standardisation needs. It should also address, where appropriate, synergies between new and existing technologies, regional approaches and other socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective. An assessment of alternative uses of the used feedstocks outside the bioenergy sector should also be done.
The exploitation of results, including IPR, should be appropriately addressed in the proposals. This involves, inter alia, ensuring a balanced role of Brazilian and European partners in such exploitation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Testing advanced biofuel technologies at pre-commercial industrial scale reduces the technological risks, paving the way for a subsequent market replication. For this purpose, the scale of the projects should permit obtaining the data and experience required so that a first-of-a-kind, commercial-scale industrial project can be envisaged as a next step. The industrial concepts demonstrated should have the potential for a significant social and economic impact, notably in terms of job opportunities and wealth creation in rural areas of Brazil or Europe. Clearly positive environmental impact should also be obtained.
Proposals should appropriately exploit the complementarities between the EU and Brazil, and pave the way for significant enhancement in the cooperation between key researchers, institutions and industries that are active in biofuel research and innovation in the EU and Brazil.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to achieve a very substantial reduction in Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs through new O&M and control concepts, including logistics planning, decision making and operation, providing an optimized balance between maximizing generation and minimizing loads on the turbines, and reducing the number of inspections and repairs with more remote monitoring and operations.
Scope:
Offshore wind turbines, both fixed bottom and floating, are subject to high loads in form of vibrations from wind and waves, as well as from rotation of the turbines. The focus is to reduce the need for maintenance of wind turbines/farms and to develop measures for life-time extension, demonstrating innovative solutions and tools, and thereby the levelised cost of wind energy. The action can include the development of tools for doing predictive maintenance, hereunder models of component/soil degradation, and establishment a database with operational and failure data for validation of tools. The actions should consider not only the wind turbines but also the substructure and the soil conditions.
Participation of wind turbine manufacturers and large wind farm operators is expected.
TRL 7 shall be achieved at the end of project activities (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 to 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts
Expected Impact:
The action will result in the reduction of component failure and increased reliability. The development of innovative solutions and tools will result in more reliable wind turbines and plants. It is expected that the output of the project will significantly contribute to an improved performance for new and operating off-shore wind power plants and therefore to the cost of energy. Presented tools and solutions might have an exploitation potential in the onshore wind sector. The action should contribute to the strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe."

Specific challenge:Actions are still needed to foster the development of the bioenergy sector and to ensure its sustainability (Renewable Energy Progress Report [COM(2013)175]). One way to do it is to use more and sustainable bioenergy. However, the EU needs to expand the supply of bioenergy produced in the EU, by encouraging the EU farmers and foresters to produce also energy and energy intermediaries.
In the short- and medium-term perspective, sustainable bioenergy in all its forms is expected to be the main contributor to the de-carbonisation. In order to achieve the EU targets set out in the RES and Fuel Quality Directives, and to address concerns regarding indirect and direct environmental impacts, sustainable bioenergy technologies (both existing and emerging) need to further penetrate the market.
Scope: Proposals should address one or several of the following bullet points using technologies and systems which are already at TRL 7-9 (please see part G of the General Annexes):
Setting up or strengthening sustainable local bioenergy supply chains that meet highest environmental criteria and quality standards, including consideration for indirect impacts and energy balances;
Ensuring development and / or implementation of quality and sustainability standards for bioenergy in all its forms;
Creating a market for sustainable intermediate bioenergy carriers to enable better technology competitiveness through economies of scale;
Encouraging European farmers and foresters to produce non-food bioenergy or bioenergy carriers alongside food, feed and other products.
Development of methodologies for the traceability of biomass feedstocks from which bioenergy is produced (e.g. to distinguish first-generation from advanced biofuels);
Removing non-technical barriers to widespread production and use of biogas/biomethane from manure and other wastes as one of the most sustainable fuels available today for use in transport and for incorporation into the grid;
Ensuring sustained public acceptance of sustainable advanced biofuels;
Exchange of information on best practices for bioenergy policy, regulations and support schemes to allow the most sustainable and energy efficient use of bio-resources.
Cooperation between different policy areas at national / regional level (e.g. energy, agriculture, environment, waste, transport, etc.) needs to be increased to optimise the regulatory framework and implementing measures for the bioeconomy through exchange of information and best practices;
All Member States must possess the necessary capacity to enact the EU legislation, while the businesses must make full use of the opportunities that these new markets create for them. Therefore specific capacity building activities targeting the main stakeholders (e.g. biomass suppliers and users, decision makers, financial institutions, auditors and verification bodies) are needed.
Tailored financing schemes for supporting investments in innovative and established bioenergy technologies must be implemented, and the most successful schemes replicated.

Up-scaling projects often lead to the development of better or less expensive applications for smaller turbines.
EU-funded projects have been working on the design of 10-20 MW wind turbine concepts for some time. The challenge is to demonstrate and construct now a full scale >10MW turbine and provide proof of a significant cost reduction potential.
Scope:
The development of large scale (>10MW) turbines will have intrinsically logistical requirements regarding handling, installation, operation and maintenance, constituting a large part of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE). Improved handling (storage, loading, transport, etc.) on land, in the harbours and/or at sea, as well as improved logistics around operations and maintenance have to be taken into account in this innovation action.
TRL 7 shall be achieved at the end of project activities (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged. Activities to engage and involve local communities in the innovation action, to further improve social acceptance are encouraged.

Expected Impact:
This action will have a positive effect on the cost of energy and offshore wind energy will become more cost-effective. Developing cost-effective and reliable large turbines will contribute to make wind power fully competitive. In 2030 the cost of energy for offshore wind should be reduced at least by 50%. The action will also result in a more effective use of the seas and oceans, and will reduce the time needed for installation, operation and maintenance. The action should contribute to the strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe."

Specific challenge:The EU is committed to an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050. Nonetheless, fossil fuels will continue to be used in Europe's power generation as well as in other industrial processes for decades to come. Therefore, the 2050 target can only be achieved if the emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the power generation sector and energy intensive industries are eliminated from the system. This will require the application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The assessments made in the context of the EU's Roadmap for the transition to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 and the Energy Roadmap 2050 see CCS as an important technology contributing to decarbonisation scenarios in the EU, with 7% to 32% of all power generation using CCS by 2050. The application of CCS to industrial sectors other than power (e.g. steel, cement, lime, chemical industry, refining) is expected to deliver half of the global emissions reduction from CCS by 2050. In the near future, these industrial applications will open up new opportunities and avenues for CCS that can accelerate its deployment. For all applications, the demonstration of CO2 storage is of major importance. Therefore, two key challenges in the short-term for driving CCS to deployment are geological storage and the application of CCS to industrial sectors other than power, including bio-CCS.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the respective key challenges as presented above, or a combination of them. Focus should be on progressing technologies that already reached TRL 4-5 to TRL 6 (please see part G of the General Annexes).  For geological storage, projects should enable, under ""real life"" conditions, the development and demonstration of best practices for the entire storage cycle, from site characterisation to operation, risk assessment, monitoring and mitigation/remediation of leakage, and including education and training. Knowledge sharing as well as early and sustained engagement of the local community is essential. In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, in particular collaboration activities between EU project(s) under this topic and non-EU projects (e.g. from Australia and/or North-America). For industrial applications, proposals should aim at integrating CCS technology in the best possible way so as to optimise the use of energy in the capture process, minimise process efficiency losses, achieve a suitable CO2 purity for transport and storage, and maintain the quality of the industrial end product. Piloting under realistic conditions is required to significantly lower the energy penalty and capture costs. Collaboration with industrial end users is essential. Knowledge sharing as well as early and sustained engagement of the local community is essential.
For geological storage, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 9 to 16 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
For industrial applications, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 to 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Demonstration of safe and environmentally sound CO2 storage will play a key role in optimising the safe operation of storage sites and in fine-tuning regulatory issues, in promoting confidence in CO2 storage and building public awareness of CCS. The cost- and resource-effective application of CCS in industrial operations will expand the available options for CCS and provide a stepping stone to its wider deployment. Pilot-scale demonstration projects should contribute to accelerating the development and deployment of CCS through an enhanced and effective cooperation in research and innovation between various stakeholders and Member States, thereby allowing a more efficient use and stronger leverage of financial resources and promoting knowledge sharing.

","23 September 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge:Gas shales have a very low porosity and permeability, and have to be fractured pervasively to create high-permeability pathways for the gas to migrate towards the wells. The fracturing process is subject to discussion, as it requires the injection of large amounts of water and chemicals, a part of which are eventually brought back to the surface. There are also concerns that the fractures may cause natural gas to leak into shallower aquifers that are used for drinking water supplies. In addition, the fracturing process can cause microseismicity, which - when felt at the surface - may give rise to public concerns. The most imminent challenge for shale gas extraction is therefore to address the associated environmental concerns, in particular through a better understanding and monitoring of the fracturing process and its environmental effects (including in the long term), treatment and recycling of flow-back and produced water, and mitigation of induced seismicity and emissions to air (including greenhouse gases).
Scope: Data collection (which could include satellite observation data), model development and identification/assessment of environmental impacts and risks of different exploration and exploitation techniques, and establishment of scientific recommendations for best practices. In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, in particular as regards knowledge sharing and collaboration with relevant US and Canadian partners.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to develop and demonstrate new advanced tools based on the first experiences of ocean energy arrays. Enabling technical risk reduction and attracting investors for future innovative array designs.
Scope:
Design tools for array of wave and tidal energy converters have been developed. Single devices have already been deployed and the first arrays are planned for 2016 onwards. Based on the experience with the first ocean energy arrays the design tools can be developed further and a 2nd generation of advanced tools is foreseen which will have a significant positive effect on future devices and arrays. The impact of design on energy yield, survivability and O&M as well as environmental impacts should be taken into account. These tools should facilitate a significant increase in reliability, survivability, performance improvement and cost reduction of devices and arrays.
TRL 6 shall be achieved at the end of project activities (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The action should clearly include an (economic) analysis of supply chains and (potential) markets and assess economic feasibility, develop a cost-benefit methodology and propose pricing methods. Eventually new or improved business and management models can be proposed.
Proposals should aim to critically evaluate relevant legal, institutional and political frameworks and ask how, why and under what conditions these could act as a barrier or an enabling element for future deployment of ocean energy.
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will reduce the technological risks for the next development stages, significantly contribute to an increase in technology performance, increase reliability and lifetime, while decreasing operation and maintenance costs, reduce the life-cycle environmental and socio-economic impacts, and reduce ocean energy technology installation time and cost and/or operational costs, hence easing the deployment of ocean energy sources within the energy mix.
The new design tools will eventually result in more cost-effective arrays and hence will reduce the cost of energy. It is expected that as a result of this action ocean energy would become more commercially attractive for investors.
The action should also contribute to the strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe."

","05 May 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge:The share of energy produced from renewable resources is growing rapidly. The output of wind and solar power is highly variable, and depends of factors such as weather conditions and time of day. With this growing share of renewable power, in particular when having priority access to the grid, fossil fuel power plants will have to increasingly shift their role from providing base-load power to providing fluctuating back-up power to meet unpredictable and short-noticed demand peaks, in order to control and stabilise the grid. Plants should be able to run both at the lowest part load possible at the highest possible efficiency. Moreover, plants will be required to operate across the entire load range with high load-change velocities, and even operate in start/stop mode with full turndown and very fast re-start, all at minimal fuel consumption. This forces base-load plants to operate closer to their design limits and through significantly more thermal cycles, leading to increased rate of wear on plant components. Operational flexibility therefore presents a significant challenge for fossil fuel power (and CHP) plants.
Scope: Focus on progressing solutions that already reached TRL 3 to TRL 4-6 (please see part G of the General Annexes) and offer the highest potential for full integration into an energy system with ever higher shares of renewable energies. Solutions with lowest greenhouse gas emissions per energy unit are preferred. Collaboration with power plant operators and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Projects should lead to new and cost-effective solutions for highly flexible new and existing fossil fuel power plants (including those using dispatchable renewable fuels), capable of meeting demand peaks and renewable output reductions, at minimal fuel consumption and emissions, while mitigating the effects of cycling operation to avoid excessive service life expenditure, and not impeding the potential CO2 capture readiness of the power plants.

Specific challenge:Facilitate trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) within this Societal Challenge with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of this Societal Challenge.
Scope: Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs covering the Challenge 'Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy'. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to this Societal Challenge as well as to gender dimension of Research and Innovation, and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The focus of activities should be on issues specific to the Societal Challenge 'Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy' and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Science with and for Society’. Where appropriate, links to other energy relevant parts of Horizon 2020, and to the overarching framework of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan should be taken into account.
Only NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries and – if their participation is deemed necessary for carrying out the action – from third countries, which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and  the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic.
Expected impact:
         An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
         A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.

Specific Challenge:International standardisation bodies and fora (like the ITU, ETSI, IEC and the GHG Protocol) and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission had developed over the last years a framework of metrics, methodologies and best practices in measuring the energy and environmental efficiency of the ICT-sector. While a number of pilot testing initiatives had been launched and supported by the European Commission (e.g. www.ict-footprint.eu) which successfully pilot tested key elements of the above framework, its broad deployment still remains an issue, particularly by smaller organisations, due notably to the lack of awareness/expertise on their side in deploying the above framework.  
Scope:The action will set up a number of support services (notably a helpdesk service, online support, translation of important documents) to facilitate/enable a fast and efficient uptake by the community (particularly by smaller organisations, notably SMEs) of the above framework. Appropriate liaisons will be established with the relevant bodies and fora that developed the above framework to ensure the availability of the relevant expertise when needed. Technical areas of focus will include (but will not be limited to) those of data centres and networks. The duration of the action will be 3-years.
Expected impact:A fast and efficient uptake of such methodologies will lead, among others, to transparency in measuring the environmental effect of the ICT-sector which, in turn, will lead to higher awareness on the energy and environmental footprint of the ICT, more efficient development and use of policy instruments for measuring and controlling the above footprint, new business opportunities and higher competitiveness of industry through the establishment of a level playing field. In this context, the ICT will play an even more important role in helping the EU reaching its energy and environmental objectives.

","Research and Innovation action
","08 December 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In view of the profound changes being made to our energy system, there is a crucial need to support and encourage the coordination and convergence of national and EU efforts in addressing research and innovation activities.
The SET Integrated Roadmap[1] provides a blueprint for how to achieve this convergence. In particular, it identifies priority areas in which Member States and/or Associated Countries are ready to elaborate and define common research and innovation agendas, and priority areas in which they are ready to set up joint projects or programmes.
This initiative aims at supporting joint activities based on European Common Research and Innovation Agendas (ECRIAs). ECRIAs will bring together on a European scale ongoing and future national efforts, so that national activities and their results in areas of significant complexity and importance can be better exploited. This will develop a critical mass of knowledge in sectors which are crucial to achieving the intended energy transition.
Scope:
Proposals will first describe how to define a common research and innovation agenda (i.e. an ECRIA) between national activities in areas identified in the SET Integrated Roadmap. The agenda will consist of a limited number of research topics related to an integration aspect of the energy system[2] which could benefit from European-wide cooperation. Some topics will be supported by national funding and others by EU funding.
In addition, the scope of the ECRIA will have to be focused on a limited number of clear deliverables, where short-term progress and a clear European added-value can be demonstrated and achieved by pulling research efforts together.
Research activities included in an ECRIA should focus on TRLs 2 to 5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
a) National funding. Topics supported by national funding will bring together research activities at different stages of development:
Recently-completed[3] research projects for which the dissemination of results can contribute to the objectives of the ECRIA.
Ongoing research projects of participating eligible entities related to the topics included in the ECRIA.
Commitment to future research activities related to the topics included in the ECRIA.
Activities supported either by institutional funding or resulting from competitive national calls can be included.
b) EU funding. The requested EU contribution shall be used to launch new research activities grouped under new topics. The EU contribution can also be used to fund the necessary coordination required to ensure that research activities are carried out in a transnational and multidisciplinary manner. Coordination costs should be kept to a minimum, and the EU contribution should be mainly used to fund research activities.
For new activities supported by the EU, eligible costs can be claimed in the same manner as for any other Research and Innovation Action under Horizon 2020.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution of up to EUR 2.5 million (which is expected to correspond to the equivalent national funding amount already committed would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
To ensure their completeness, proposals must:
Provide details of all the national funding contributed and committed to the ECRIA which leverages the EU contribution, in the form of details of the funds received by the respective participants for the recently-completed and ongoing projects included in the ECRIA, as well as for any other contributions in kind (e.g. human resources, use of existing research facilities). Details of the funding committed to future research activities related to ECRIA should be included.
Include a clear common research and innovation agenda covering at least the next three years. The agenda shall include a clear and detailed description of the expected outputs and outcomes.
Demonstrate how the programming schedule of the national resources incorporated to the ECRIA underpins the common agenda.
Provide a description of the governance that will be put in place to implement the ECRIA. Governance should be kept as simple as possible and, where possible, it should make use of pre-existing governance structures.
The above elements will be taken into consideration in the evaluation of the quality and efficiency of the implementation criterion.
In addition, proposals should foresee:
Activities to lay the foundations for long-lasting future co-operation by building a transnational critical mass in the funded research areas.
Exchange of researchers to facilitate co-operation
Shared use of existing research facilities, models and databases.
Expected Impact:
First, ECRIAs will support the development of the common research and innovation agendas of the SET Integrated Roadmap, thus contributing to objectives of the Energy Union and the European Research Area.
This new ECRIA model will then develop a critical mass of research capacity in Europe, specifically addressing certain complex integration aspects of the energy system. This capacity, which does not exist yet, is crucial if Europe wants to complete successfully its energy transition in the long term. ECRIAs target the coordination of national efforts in order to develop synergies and improve the impact of public investment in emergent sectors.
Proposals should give priority to the following, which will be taken into consideration during evaluation under the impact criterion:
Addressing the complexity of the integration of the energy system by targeting specific and limited aspects of the current problems where significant short-term progress can be achieved by integrating multidisciplinary research activities.
Identifying gaps within national programmes/activities in order to decide the content of the new topics that will be supported by the EU contribution.
Demonstrating the coherence of the different elements brought together and the added value of the choices made to deliver on the objectives in the most efficient and timely way possible.

","Research and Innovation action
","20 September 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU is committed to an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050. Nonetheless, fossil fuels will continue to be used in Europe's power generation as well as in other industrial processes for decades to come. Therefore, the 2050 target can only be achieved if the emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the power generation sector and energy intensive industries are eliminated from the system. This will require the application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). A key challenge in the short-term for driving CCS to deployment is the development of geological storage.
Scope:
Projects should enable, under ""real life"" conditions, the development and demonstration of best practices for the entire storage cycle, from site characterisation to operation, including key components of CO2 transport infrastructure, monitoring and mitigation/remediation of leakage, and including education and training.
Focus should be on progressing technologies that already reached TRL 4-5 to TRL 6 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Knowledge sharing with a wide range of stakeholders, as well as early and sustained engagement and involvement of concerned communities through targeted information and dissemination activities, is essential.
In this particular context, new types of interactions between societal actors are encouraged. Projects should identify the key drivers and influencers of public attitude, identify distorted perceptions and develop sound arguments to address them.
International cooperation is encouraged, in particular activities between EU project(s) under this topic and non-EU projects (e.g. from Australia and/or North-America).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 9 to 16 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstration of safe and environmentally sound CO2 storage will play a key role in optimising the safe operation of storage sites and in fine-tuning regulatory issues, in promoting confidence in CO2 storage and building public awareness of CCS. Pilot-scale demonstration projects should contribute to accelerating the development and deployment of CCS through an enhanced and effective cooperation in research and innovation between various stakeholders and Member States/Associated Countries, thereby allowing a more efficient use and stronger leverage of financial resources and promoting knowledge sharing.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU needs to accelerate the transformation of its energy system by bridging the gap between research and the market with innovative solutions to obstacles in the development of low carbon technologies.
Bridging this gap often requires substantial volumes of investment which cannot be allocated by individual countries or by the European Commission on their own. European Union funding is only a limited part of the total funding available across Europe. In such cases, mobilising the necessary investment can only be achieved by pooling together financial resources from multiple countries, the Commission, and the private sector. This is a challenge because the funding landscape is complex.
One of the objectives of the SET Plan is to create funding synergies on such a big scale by organising joint programming actions between the entities responsible for public funding programmes and the Commission. ERA-NETs are the main instrument for joint programming actions within the SET Plan, and they also contribute to achieving the objectives of the European Research Area (ERA). In addition, they can play a key role in achieving the goal of the Energy Union of moving away from a fragmented system characterised by uncoordinated national policies and towards a new European R&I approach which accelerates the transformation of the energy system. It is therefore politically important to support ERA-NETs and to facilitate their existence as much as possible.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States, Associated Countries and Regions in the areas and challenges targeted in the Renewable Energy Technologies, Decarbonising Fossil Fuels and Socio-Economics sections of the Competitive Low-Carbon Energy (LCE) call.
Individual topics suitable for ERA-NETs will be identified and discussed in close collaboration with Member States'/Associated Countries' representatives through the SET Plan governance bodies and with representatives of the Energy configuration of the H2020 Programme Committee.
Proposals will have to pay particular attention to tackling the following challenges:
Focusing on demonstration projects and on bringing innovative low carbon energy solutions closer to commercial deployment.
Encouraging industrial participation to leverage private sector investment.
Strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating economic growth and jobs in Europe.
Reducing the environmental impact of the energy system.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are encouraged to implement other joint activities, including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
Participation of legal entities from international partner countries is encouraged in the joint call as well as in additional joint activities, on the basis of common interest and mutual benefit. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding[1] may nonetheless request an EU contribution to cover the coordination costs of additional activities on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that this action will help to:
Establish long-lasting joint programming research efforts between Member States/Associated Countries in areas of common interest.
Accelerate the time to market of affordable, cost-effective and resource-efficient technology solutions which decarbonise the energy system in a sustainable way.
Encourage industrial participation and leverage private sector investment.
Strengthen the European industrial technology base, thereby creating economic growth and jobs in Europe.
Reduce the environmental impact of the energy system.

","07 April 2022","Objective:
Support the full implementation of the following plans and strategies:
Circular Economy: National or Regional Circular Economy Action Plans, Strategies, Roadmaps or similar, which are officially approved, and which include specific and measurable actions, or targets, with a clear timeline and are in line with or complementing the objectives of the EU Circular Economy Action Plan.
Waste: National and regional Waste Management Plans pursuant to Article 28 of the Waste Framework Directive and/or Waste Prevention Programmes as requested by article 29 of the Waste Framework Directive.
Water: River basin management plans pursuant to Annex VII to the Water Framework Directive, Flood Risk Management Plans pursuant to the Floods Directive or Marine Strategies pursuant to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.
Air: Air quality plans pursuant to the Ambient Air Quality Directive or National Air Pollution Control Programmes pursuant to the National Emission Ceilings Directive.
Scope:
SIPs should aim at the full implementation of the strategies and plans listed in ""Objective"". This might not mean that the SIP will cover all actions foreseen in the strategy/plan or that the strategy/plan will be fully implemented during the lifetime of the SIP. However, the SIP shall include strategic actions to catalyse a process and mobilise supplementary commitments and funding that will lead, in due time, to the full implementation of the plan or strategy.
SIPs shall promote the coordination with and mobilisation of other relevant Union, national or private funding sources for the implementation of the complementary measures or actions outside of the SIP in the framework of the targeted plan or strategy, giving preference to EU funding. Within the SIP itself, however, co-funding may not come from other EU funding sources.
SIPs shall actively involve the main stakeholders necessary for the implementation of the targeted plan or strategy. They should be involved in both the design and implementation of the given project. This involvement is expected to be achieved by including them - where possible and reasonable - as associated beneficiaries of the SIP, or through their active participation in the implementation of the SIP itself and/or of the complementary actions.
SIPs should facilitate and result in the building up of strategic capacities among the competent authorities and stakeholders to ensure a long-term sustainability of project results and actions, and to ensure that they will be able to function as co-deliverers of the targeted plan or strategy during or after the end of the SIP.
The SIP complexity requires an adaptive approach in the design of the implementing mechanism. For this reason, SIPs will be implemented based on a revolving programming mechanism structured in phases (i.e. Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.). Each phase should normally last at least 3 years, to reduce administrative burden, although duration might be shorter if properly justified.
See Call document for a more detailed description of SIPs scope and features.
Expected Impact:
By the end of the project: at least substantial contribution to the implementation of the targeted plan/strategy, and mechanisms established to ensure full implementation of the plan/strategy.
After the project: Full implementation of the plan/strategy.
In relation to those expected impacts, applicants are expected to define, calculate, explain and achieve the expected impacts as described in Award criterion ‘Impact’ of the full proposal evaluation (see Call document)."

","20 September 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Exposure to aircraft noise has an adverse effect on population. High levels of perceived noise have also an important impact on future extensions of airports which are reaching their capacity limits. Despite significant progress on noise reduction at source and on noise abatement procedures, aircraft noise continues to cause adverse effects on quality of life and on public health, notably in the neighbourhood of major airports. Ensuring that airports will have the capability to respond to the growing traffic demand requires more systematic approaches to aviation noise management bringing together technological, operational and planning solutions. To address these challenges, stronger coordination between national, international and EU research activities is necessary.
Scope:
Actions should address the development of new technologies and methodologies to enable 24/7 operations, including new methods for assessing, monitoring and managing the impact of aviation noise. They should also support the coordination of national and EU research activities related to aviation noise and consider possibilities for international cooperation. The actions should address one or several of the following areas:
―Development of new aircraft/engine technologies for noise reduction at the source.
―Novel approaches for assessing and managing the impact of aviation noise, including aspects such as new airport noise reduction strategies, novel cost-effective solutions for the monitoring of noise footprints and health impacts.The developed methodologies and tools should complement ongoing efforts on noise-emissions interdependencies modelling and be open to the EU research and policy community.
―Integration of aviation-related environmental assessment approaches in land-use planning practices and tools with the aim of enabling a higher level of effectiveness in scenario- analysis and decision-support capability whilst allowing heightened proficiency for use by non-specialists.
―Better understanding on sonic boom policy and regulations in support to the regulatory discussions at United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation.
Particular emphasis should be given to innovative approaches towards reducing noise at the source and for mitigating the noise impact of air traffic operations. The development of well-reasoned and scientifically-rooted decision-making approaches for purposes of deploying the latter should be stressed, notably ensuring a level of end-user friendliness compatible with their utilisation by non-experts – such as land-use and regional development planners.
The actions should support the coordination of national and EU research activities related to aviation noise, notably towards establishing a common strategic research roadmap for aviation noise reduction.
The promotion of synergies with other industrial sectors which are confronted with similar noise-related problems is encouraged.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged, in particular in relation to sonic boom, in order to contribute to the regulatory discussions at United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions will lead to new and more holistic approaches for aviation noise reduction, coupling innovative airframe/engine technologies with operational aspects, airport infrastructure and connectivity, and land-use planning solutions. They will also lead to easy-to-use decision support systems for purposes of elaborating sustainable airport development plans fit for use. They are also expected to lead to a European noise impact modelling tools, open for research and policy purposes. It is also expected that the proposals will gather critical mass on a pan-European scale, overcoming gaps, duplication and fragmentation, create a leverage effect, enhance coherence and efficiency of noise research in Europe, and underpin the development of future noise related regulations, operations, and technology. By doing so, actions are expected to contribute to the improvement of health conditions of the population particularly in areas near airports and air corridors, as well as to economic activities linked to sustainable airport development plans.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) has developed in 2012 a new Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda that describes the actions needed to meet the highly ambitious goals set by Flightpath 2050. In order to ensure the achievement of these goals, regular assessment of progress, gaps and barriers is necessary and strong collaboration between all European stakeholders is required.
In 2017 attention will also be paid to collaborations with non-European stakeholders where relevant, in order to solve common challenges, leverage resources, mitigate risks and establish long-term relationships.
Scope:
In 2016, the actions should address one the following areas:
―Identification of barriers for increased collaboration in aviation research at EU level involving countries and regions with lower participation in the EU Framework Programmes and recently Associated Countries such as Ukraine. The action should stimulate cooperation by creating and enhancing the links between the stakeholders of these countries and other aviation research intensive regions. Win-win situations and solutions for improved cooperation should be identified.
―Identification and assessment of the needs, gaps and overlaps for strategic aviation research infrastructures in Europe. The actions should establish an overview of the existing situation taking into account the results of previous actions on this issue. They should involve analysis on the potential sustainable business models and funding schemes to maintain existing or to develop new aviation research infrastructures.
In 2017, the actions should address one of the two following areas:
1) Provide on an annual basis a review of the state of the art of research and innovation including international benchmarking, identify gaps in the research landscape, bottlenecks to innovation (regulation, financing) and formulate recommendations to address those. The actions should address one or several of the following research domains of the ACARE Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda:
―Mobility
―Competitiveness
―Environment and energy
―Safety and security
A close cooperation with the relevant ACARE Working Groups and involvement of all main relevant stakeholders should be ensured. The actions should take into consideration R&D synergies with other sectors (e.g. batteries, composites, product lifecycle management). Special attention should be paid on the economic, environmental and mobility aspects of the long distance traveling.
2) Set up an open platform between EU and relevant third countries to reach out to research and innovation stakeholders (industry, research establishments and academia) and aviation research and innovation funding authorities in order to facilitate and increase collaboration along common research and innovation roadmaps. Proposers should take into account achievements of past and on-going cooperation initiatives such as the H2020 coordinated calls with Canada, China and Japan, and previous support actions[1]. Proposals can include organisation of workshops and studies to identify win-win opportunities, areas of common interest, barriers and solutions for improved cooperation in research and technology development as well as recommendations for future actions. Proposers should demonstrate relevant background in aviation research cooperation with third countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The actions will support to reach the goals set by the aviation sector in a more efficient and optimal way thorough assessment of the progress towards Flightpath 2050 goals[2], identification of future needs, gaps and barriers, and make recommendations for further actions. The actions will result also in providing solutions for improved research infrastructure for the European aviation sector adapted to the needs for achieving the long term goals. The actions will support also a more efficient use of the available research capabilities in Europe through creating new links between the stakeholders of EU Member States, Associated Countries and third Countries, stimulating the creation of transnational cooperation mechanisms in the aviation research.

The Facilitator would broker a small number of public procurements of innovative products or services and demonstrate the effectiveness of this model of cooperation. The output of the projects should allow further analysis of experience and future optimisation of the process and better inclusion of SMEs and start-ups. The results would also be useful for further development of the business model of operation for such Facilitators. The Facilitator will not be procuring the actual goods or services.
Qualitative and quantitative indicators for the action:
Number of public buyers engaging in the network;
Number of private sellers engaging in the network;
Number of established contacts / relationships between public buyers and SMEs/start-ups;
Number of identified innovative products or services suitable to meet the identified needs of the public buyers;
Number of good practices identified and recommendations formulated in view of a simplification of the PPI;
Number of identified possible additional funding opportunities for innovative products or services.
Scope:
This action aims at further demonstrating the relevance and effectiveness of the cooperation model between various stakeholders supporting through public procurement the promotion of innovation and the support to economic operators, in particular SMEs and Start-ups. It is a second experimentation of this cooperation model under the COSME programme.
It proposes to bring together potential public buyers, suppliers of innovation (with a special focus on SMEs and start-ups), and potential investors and researchers, with a view to determine projects suitable for public procurement of innovation.

The purpose will be to:
- Determine the emerging needs of the public sector (i.e. large buyers) in strategically selected technologies.
- Provide network with stakeholders, such as scientists and other suppliers of knowledge (e.g. start-ups) in strategic fields.
- Provide for the engagement of funding partners: public funds (such as Union funding opportunities), private funds and large enterprises willing to provide funding at various stages of commercialization of innovation.
- Allow for the brokering funding opportunities, technological and business aspects between all stakeholders.
Programme funding would include the following activities:
A Facilitator for networking activities and stakeholders management;
Logistics, including travelling costs of participants
The proof of concepts of selected projects
Stakeholders' costs relating to the participation in the process (the cost of procurement of the relevant goods or services is excluded from this funding).
The facilitator would engage with large buyers and/or aggregators of public procurement to identify a small number of needs (problems). Subsequently, the facilitator would engage the ""sources of innovation"" (i.e. start-ups, innovative SMEs) through its network and ask them to provide solutions for the identified need. A small number of those solutions would receive funding to develop their competitive ideas that the enterprises could pitch to the buyers for potential procurement at a later stage. The action would involve parties coming potentially from any Union Member State (and participating countries). There is also a clear focus on the promotion of SMEs and start-up companies, who could become involved through projects to provide innovation through this programme."

2) Set up an open platform between EU and relevant third countries to reach out to research and innovation stakeholders (industry, research establishments and academia) and aviation research and innovation funding authorities in order to facilitate and increase collaboration along common research and innovation roadmaps. Proposers should take into account achievements of past and on-going cooperation initiatives such as the H2020 coordinated calls with Canada, China and Japan, and previous support actions[1]. Proposals can include organisation of workshops and studies to identify win-win opportunities, areas of common interest, barriers and solutions for improved cooperation in research and technology development as well as recommendations for future actions. Proposers should demonstrate relevant background in aviation research cooperation with third countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The actions will support to reach the goals set by the aviation sector in a more efficient and optimal way thorough assessment of the progress towards Flightpath 2050 goals[2], identification of future needs, gaps and barriers, and make recommendations for further actions. The actions will result also in providing solutions for improved research infrastructure for the European aviation sector adapted to the needs for achieving the long term goals. The actions will support also a more efficient use of the available research capabilities in Europe through creating new links between the stakeholders of EU Member States, Associated Countries and third Countries, stimulating the creation of transnational cooperation mechanisms in the aviation research.

","03 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
1. CSA subtopic: Substantial national and EU funds are spent on transport infrastructure development in all modes of transport. The efficiency of these expenditures is closely related to the level of use of modern innovative and sustainable solutions and on coordination among Member States. In order to facilitate continuous cooperation and coordination among public and private actors and to improve the uptake of new sustainable solutions, a structured dialogue between relevant stakeholders should be initiated and sustained with the key objective of successful deployment of research results.
2. RIA subtopic: An area where research and coordination is needed is the use of robotised equipment, drones or other (semi)-automated remote-piloted solutions, offering significant potential to reduce workers exposure to live traffic and construction machines, to increase the availability of the transport network, as well as to automate and reduce the cost of repeatable tasks and safety upgrades. Significant advances in robotising the upgrade or maintenance of network infrastructures based on standardising, modularising and industrial prefabricating of large percentage of the infrastructure will ease the way to automate most construction, repair and retrofitting projects.
Scope:
In order to meet these large challenges this topic will be implemented through two types of actions
1. Coordination and Support Action
Transport infrastructure can result in significant and lasting degradation of ecosystems and habitats. Considering Europe has the highest transport infrastructure density in the world, there is an urgent need to address this rapidly increasing challenge.
Stronger cooperation should be developed between national, regional, European and international supporting programmes and initiatives on research, innovation and deployment, aimed at improving transport infrastructure performance on environmental and social sustainability. For instance, synergies with Horizon 2020 and CEF projects, as well as with the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020 should be established, while building as much as possible from relevant existing proven structures and platforms of infrastructure stakeholders. In order to ultimately ensure sufficient deployment impact, the proposals should include the national transport infrastructure authorities with responsibility for managing their national networks from at least 10 countries (Member States or Associated Countries), ensuring strong engagement in relevant European platforms and wider reach.
Proposals should cover all the following issues:
Successful roll-out of a Strategic Research and Deployment Agenda (SRDA) endorsed by the national transport infrastructure authorities and the public innovation programme owners, representing the societal and environmental needs and requirements for infrastructure innovation. The agenda will take input from the relevant industry stakeholders, in close cooperation with the research community as well as environmental agencies which will supply innovative solutions. and developing alternative and more-biodiversity-friendly transport modes (e.g. bicycle paths and highways).
Particular focus should be on innovative solutions in the planning and design stage of the infrastructure life cycle as this stage offers the best opportunities for achieving environmentally sustainable transport infrastructure network for Europe’s citizens reducing the harmful impact on the environmental and social sustainability.
The proposal should include opportunities for adapting transport infrastructure in view of changing demand, social changes, climate, biodiversity, technology and digitalisation. The work will feed into the strategic research and innovation (R&I) agenda of the relevant stakeholders, which should be jointly developed and implemented by the transport authorities, the research community, the infrastructure operators and civil society. Clear priorities should be agreed and widely communicated so they can reflect an aim for building sustainable and environmentally-friendly infrastructure.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU for sub topic 1 (CSA) of between EUR 2.5-3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. There shall be only one project selected for the sub topic 1.
2. Research and Innovation Action
This topic should be considered as a follow-up of previous calls on remote sensing, monitoring and decision support to maintenance planning, and should be taken into consideration to develop the phase of intervention, to achieve the maximum automation possible in physical interventions to maintain the integrity, performance and safety levels of the infrastructure.
Proposals should cover all the following issues:
Application of robotics and remote piloted systems to infrastructure upgrade or maintenance works to push the transport sector in the automated era and increase the overall productivity and efficiency of the transport infrastructure, thus relieving the burden of the costs on the users.
Development of robotized equipment to perform routine, periodic or emergency maintenance works; adequate connections with the structural and functional monitoring sensors and traffic management system to deploy automatic intervention of robots and remote piloted systems while respecting safety operations and personnel.
Development of robotized equipment for larger interventions of maintenance or upgrading to be remotely controlled in non-routine circumstances avoiding disruption of other routine operations and increasing coordination between them and other involved agents.
Proposals should foster the development and use of industrial-prefabricated infrastructures and modularising the planning, designing, and construction phases for retrofit projects using robotised equipment to perform automated construction or maintenance tasks.
Possibilities for utilising V2I communication for capturing data and processing by AI for predictive maintenance should also be considered. New technologies, such as for instance AR and VR modelling, AI and drone technologies should be taken into account.
Projects must consider a pilot demonstration in operational environment (minimum at TRL7 level). Testing and deployment on CEF corridors and possible synergies with CEF innovation projects is to be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU for sub topic 2 (RIA) of between EUR 4 and 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
1. Coordination and Support Action
Improved environmental performance of Europe’s transport infrastructure and networks (e.g. reduction of habitats' fragmentation).
Targeted research and deployment actions and efficient use of resources within a coherent innovation strategy
Strengthened lasting synergies between relevant national, regional (European) and international innovation programmes and initiatives.
Widespread awareness of European efforts, as well as increased visibility of R&I outcomes and their contribution to improving environmental performance and biodiversity in a safe transport infrastructure network.
Increased take-up of innovation outcomes by market, national authorities and relevant national platforms, while strengthening the alignment of innovation deployment of national infrastructure authorities in Europe.
2. Research and Innovation Action
Reduction of fatal accidents due to maintenance works of road users and deployed personnel by 50%
Reduction of traffic disruption due to maintenance works by 20%
Reduction of routine maintenance costs by 20%
Improvement of network capacity by 20%, based on the levels measured at the beginning for the project.

","Research and Innovation action
","03 September 2019
","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
The transition towards connected and automated mobility, also in a mixed environment with conventional vehicles/vessels requires effective network and traffic management solutions. For instance, bottlenecks across road, rail, air and water can result in system-wide capacity constraints, traffic jams and increased pollutant emissions. As a result, an advanced multi-modal transport system requires coordinated and organised traffic flows to dynamically optimise the entire transport network. Furthermore, integrated urban and inter-urban traffic management and mobility information systems contribute to optimising transport flows both through cities and in rural regions. This challenge calls for the design and optimisation of intelligent systems and operations, to monitor live traffic conditions and flow performance, to enable real-time traffic information sharing and network-wide optimisation processes, adapting flows and configurations, as well as to allow distribution of control actions to network users via connected/cooperative devices. Such an advanced network and traffic management capability should also enable new dynamic mobility services for passengers and freight.
Scope:
In order to meet this challenge, proposals should build on existing state-of-the-art and address at least 6 of the following aspects:
Analyse the requirements for a next-generation multi-modal network and traffic management capability (incl. intra-modal optimisation and development of cross-modal interfaces), which would enable the integration of smart infrastructures, connected and automated vehicles, systems and services into a truly multi-modal network.
Design an architecture and concept of operations for an efficient, resilient and adaptable multi-modal network and traffic management system, using innovative data collection/fusion techniques and leveraging where possible existing standards/methods for data exchange.
Assess the relevance, differentiation and preference for a centralised versus a decentralised approach towards network and traffic management in the presence of connected and automated vehicles. Existing work in this area, including from the Joint Research Centre should be taken into consideration.
Develop multi-actor organisational and business models with shared responsibilities, which would enable effective network and traffic management by designing appropriate interfaces and interactions between the different traffic management systems of stakeholders.
Develop tools for dynamic transport demand management and dynamic transport supply optimisation, enabling demand-capacity balancing for efficient journey management (for passengers and freight taking into account men’s and women’s needs).
Design and calibrate arbitration models for complex network and traffic management scenarios and multi-actor settings, including disaster management (optimising multiple performance targets, enabling triggering conditions and balancing individual versus collective needs).
Perform simulations for traffic optimisation under various scenarios (e.g. large/sport event) involving smart infrastructures, conventional as well as connected and automated vehicles, in urban / non-urban settings, considering foreseen (e.g. roadworks) or unforeseen circumstances (e.g. accidents), within a multi-modal network and traffic management system.
Develop and test traffic management systems for connected and automated vehicle fleets, enabling the efficient operation of such fleets on open roads and thereby, contributing to smart, energy efficient, multimodal mobility concepts.
Design a classification index for smart infrastructures, according to their capability to effectively support optimised network and traffic management for connected and automated vehicles.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 4 to 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:
Accelerate the transition towards connected and automated mobility and the development of new services;
Facilitate the integration of transport modes into a multimodal network for passengers and freight;
Reduce capacity bottlenecks and, traffic jams, thereby saving time (for passengers and freight) and reducing pollutant emissions, leading also to positive health effects in Europe;
Improve safety and security in all transport modes, in line with the Transport White Paper (e.g. Vision Zero);
Reduce the cost of mobility for all (incl. industry, public authorities and citizens)."
