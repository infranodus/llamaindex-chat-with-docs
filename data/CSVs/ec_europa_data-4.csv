","Coordination and support action
","03 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Ensuring the seamless integration and harmonisation of transport modes is essential to achieve a truly integrated freight transport and logistics system, which on the one hand, is able to manage efficiently the physical, information and financial flows and on the other hand, support less impacting and environmental sustainable logistics operations . Speeding up technological and organisational innovation uptake and adoption will support freight transport decarbonisation and competitiveness. To this purpose, the assessment of progress, gaps and barriers is necessary. It is also key to involve and engage the end users of multimodal end-to-end freight transport chains, as they are both the recipients of innovation (autonomous transport, electrification, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, robotic systems, further digitalisation, new transport modes, etc.) and the key actors in charge of developing the business cases for new technologies uptake.
Scope:
Proposals shall address all of the following areas:
Perform a reasoned and detailed analysis of the products, services, solutions for business applications and other value added results generated by EU-funded projects (at the level of projects and/or cluster of projects), contributing to the achievement of EU policy objectives (e.g. zero city logistics emissions by 2030, zero logistics emissions by 2050, efficient free movement of goods and services) and a truly integrated transport system. This analysis should possibly cover projects funded since the 5th Framework Programme for Research. Building on previous mapping and benchmarking activities such as the SETRIS project[1] and the pilot action on Implementation of Multimodal Innovative Solutions[2], evaluate e.g. the level of maturity of the products, services, solutions achieved within the projects and further development carried out beyond the projects, investigate which solutions have been implemented and adopted by the freight transport and logistics stakeholders and compare them with the state-of-the-art in the sector. Assess the barriers to the deployment of R&I results and propose solutions and actions to improve the framework conditions and overcome the identified barriers. Assess the impact of EU-funded R&I projects on various areas of freight transport and logistics (including urban logistics) by establishing possible causal links between public R&I funding and technology innovation in an area. Synergetic impact from regional/national programmes should also be considered. Examine in which areas EU funding had the highest impact, identify the framework conditions and actions which supported this outcome. Propose sectoral-specific impact Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and recommendations to increase the research impact.
Identify and prioritise gaps in the research landscape and market needs to be tackled by future R&I actions[3] for an integrated freight transport and logistics system, also via a reasoned analysis of best practices and activities at relevant international level.
Support the wider engagement of the freight transport and logistics stakeholders (reaching out to the ones less familiar with European R&I) in order to increase the uptake of research outcomes and innovation by the logistics community at large. Develop an appropriate framework to foster collaboration and exchange of best practices in freight transport and logistics R&I at regional, national, European and global level.
Engage with relevant sectors beyond freight transport and logistics to support cross-fertilisation and synergies within multidisciplinary projects (e.g. ICT, Circular Economy, Manufacturing and Supply Chain, Security).
The analysis will extend beyond the work carried out within the projects, clearly evaluating the project outcomes’ impact, as well as the framework conditions and activities which support high impact of public R&I funding. It will also establish possible causal links between public R&I funding and technology innovation in a specific logistics area. The analysis will be complemented by clear recommendations on future R&I activities to achieve an efficient and sustainable freight transport and logistics system.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. As the focus of this action is on analysing the impact of EU-funded R&I projects, at least 50% of the budget will have to be dedicated to the activities described under the first two bullet points.
Expected Impact:
The action will contribute to achieve the EU policy objectives for freight transport and logistics (e.g. zero city logistics emissions by 2030, zero logistics emissions by 2050, fully integrated multimodal transport system, efficient and sustainable logistic and freight operations) by providing a reasoned and detailed mapping and assessment of the EU-funded R&I project outcomes.
The action will also support technological and organisational innovation uptake and a more efficient use of the available research resources by engaging the wider community of stakeholders, establishing collaboration between industrial stakeholders and the society at large, encouraging exchanges of best practices at regional, national, European and global level, and linking to relevant sectors beyond freight transport and logistics.

","Coordination and support action
","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Recent research work[1] carried out on 10 year-long set of reported civil incidents involving drones around the world has found that technical problems (most notably, broken communication links) rather than errors by operators are the major cause of those incidents (circa 64% of the total). This evidence points to the need for adequate airworthiness rules for drone safety and better reporting of accidents.
Whilst multiple local or regional initiatives by aviation safety regulators have emerged worldwide to address this issue, they have been often impacted by the needs for providing timely responses to regional market demands, eventually resulting in significant regional differences in the technical requirements of recreational, professional-grade and specialized industrial drones. The growth in the number and diversity of mass-market drone operations – cf. delivering packages, taking photos, geo-surveying, firefighting or search and rescue – make it essential that safety regulations, including relevant technical aspects, ultimately keep-up with this buoyant and rapidly-growing industry.
In parallel, penetration in the Europe market is often hampered by a lack of mutual recognition of drones-based products and services between States – obliging manufacturers and operators to seek certifications with multiple national authorities.
The EU, through EASA, is currently developing a harmonised performance-driven regulatory framework building upon ""best practice"". This framework should ultimately ensure safe and environmentally sound operations and reduce the barriers to market entry for businesses that would like to integrate drones in their value chain. The implementation and effectiveness of such a framework will depend eventually on a relevant body of appropriate technical standards – supporting demonstration of compliance of product features or technologies with applicable requirements. Such over-arching framework could equally serve as an input for global standards and procedures.
Scope:
Gather comprehensive global information on on-going[2] and planned work on technical rules, standards and procedures for civilian markets and/or use in civilian airspaces,;
Critically assess and benchmark the gathered information, providing a knowledge-base of ""best practice"" and data aimed at supporting the EASA's regulatory due-process; particular emphasis shall be given to the provision of data for purposes of validation of specific product or technical requirements;
Contribute to the development and subsequent validation of a well-reasoned set of technical standards that are appropriate for all relevant categories of drones.
Consortia should include organisations from all parts of the drone value-chain – drone/part suppliers, operators, academia, and safety regulators – to ensure the triplet of user-producer-oversight competences required for full performance and swift delivery of the work.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Support to the on-going EU regulatory process for technical rules, standards and procedures for civilian drones to enable safe, environmentally sound and reliable operations in Europe with a view to accelerate the timing and enhance the quality of such due-process. Generate additional leverage for Europe in the international negotiations for global rules and standards.
Increase the acceptance of EU standards in the global drone product and service marketplace, generating economies of scale towards reducing costs whilst de-risking customer choice.
Offer better opportunities for European drone designers, manufacturers and operators in accessing global markets.

","Research and Innovation action
","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This action is part of the Aviation International Cooperation Flagship called ""Safer and Greener Aviation in a Smaller World"" mentioned in the introduction to this work programme 2018-2020.
Aviation is inherently and increasingly international. Aviation impacts globally the atmosphere, and vice-versa. Aviation emissions to the atmosphere are increasing. In-flight weather hazards are also increasing worldwide. Meanwhile, the demand for aviation keeps growing globally. Commercial Air-Transport (CAT) fatal and non-fatal accidents are continuously decreasing with EASA Member States accident rate much lower than the world-wide one[1]. However, in-flight weather hazards, in particular icing conditions, are a contributing factor in accidents and incidents world-wide. In line with ACARE Strategic Research & Innovation Agenda, further advancements in understanding, modelling, detection, avoidance and mitigation of in-flight performance degradation are necessary towards enabling harmonised certification with less flight trials.
Scope:
Although several research activities addressed the issue of ice accretion on aircraft, resulting in improved understanding of icing phenomena, and also in promising strategies to detect and to remove ice accretion, those advancements were mostly focused on airframe. Future advancements should also include engines as well as rotorcrafts. In addition, reduction of power consumption of in-flight anti/de-icing devices and of the negative environmental impact of anti/de-icing processes is necessary, both in-flight and on the ground.
The proposals may aim at addressing several or all of the following areas:
Further advancements in the detection, understanding, sensing, modelling, simulation and testing of icing, de-icing and anti-icing of all types in aviation (e.g. mixed-phase, ice crystals, super cooled large droplets, etc).
Explore/propose/validate new certification methods, means of compliance, standards and protection systems (e.g. either active or passive, including coatings) for all types of icing and air vehicles, engines and on-board systems.
Address the overall system integration, including operational and maintenance aspects.
The range of TRLs to address is broad, from fundamental research up to TRL 5 (at the end of the project). In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[2]), multilateral international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries such as United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, Brazil and Australia. International cooperation can include work towards global monitoring of in-service events and icing hazards and towards joint tests, standards and certification, taking into account the activities of bodies such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), EUROCAE and United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Proposals may include the commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency to assist or to participate in the action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contribute to increase passenger safety by fewer accidents and less in-flight events worldwide.
Contribute to decrease costs for all parties (e.g. industry, authorities, research & test centres) by improved and internationally accepted certification, standards and means of compliance, covering all types of icing hazards.
Contribute to decrease delays in operations thanks to more efficient avoidance of icing hazards and to fewer damages in need of inspection and repair.

","Research and Innovation action
","05 September 2018
","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
The drone market is the fastest growing in aerospace, generating high-skilled jobs and enabling innovative services, both in the public sector at large (safety, security, environment monitoring, …) and in the private sector (farming, infrastructure, delivery, inspection, broadcasting, leisure, …), not only by large companies but also by many SMEs including start-ups. More services with drones and other emerging technologies can underpin safety and security in different transport modes: waterborne, railways, road transport and air transport.
The EU can strengthen its internal market and bolster its global market share by boosting in a consistent manner the development and safe and secure use of drones for civil and commercial purposes in the EU, notably allowing them to fly in the Single European Sky[1], including over European waters (e.g sea route and harbours) or to sail in European waterways and coastal areas. The development of vertical spatial + transport planning tools/methodologies and the development of technologies that help authorities in charge (e.g. city police officers) to ensure the enforcement of rules and to prevent abuse of drones for unwanted purposes can help to safely integrate drones in concepts for the last mile delivery in cities or rural areas..
Drones can be considered in a broad sense i.e. Unmanned Aerial Systems, including autonomous and remotely piloted systems. On the one hand drones can be problematic for transport safety and security. This is addressed in SESAR2020 and by the IMO at MSC 98, with a view to ensure enforcement of regulations on drones as well as safe and secure integration into Air and Maritime Traffic Management. On the other hand, drones can be enablers of safety and security of current transport means, for instance by monitoring large vehicles/vessels/air vehicles, transport infrastructure and transport operations and users in nominal and also contingency conditions, such as search and rescue. Furthermore, delivery by drones can enhance mobility services in line with the U-space concept set by the EU in the Riga Declaration. In any cases, public acceptance, privacy issues and other legal aspects of the widespread use of drones are recognised as essential, especially in urban environments.
Scope:
The proposals are expected to address both of the following research areas:
- Develop and test technologies, operational and business models for the application of drones or drone swarms and other emerging technologies to increase the safety, security, public acceptance and overall efficiency of air, waterborne and surface transport, both passenger and cargo, including search and rescue applications.
- Explore and develop innovative technologies and sustainable business models for pilot services, such as large vehicles/vessels/aircraft inspections, transport management (including emergencies), transport infrastructure condition monitoring and maintenance, logistics, on-demand cargo and/or personal mobility using drones and other emerging technologies safely.
Efficient, reliable and secure (taking into account cybersecurity) collection, distribution (including wireless transmission) and automatic processing of data (on ground and on board) should be included (e.g including through sensor integration) while respecting privacy rights/personal data protection requirements. Also requirements from law enforcement agencies and insurance should be considered.
Scaled demonstration of the services should underpin and accelerate the regulatory adaptation, certification, public acceptance, standards validation and follow-on deployment in Europe, including innovative commercial and public pre-procurement. Applications of drones should leverage synergies among EU satellite-based systems for navigation (EGNOS/Galileo), observation (Copernicus) and communication.
Proposals should also ensure consistency with the overall regulatory framework, in particular with EASA's work for systems certification and standardisation and complementarity with SESAR2020 Programme (including SESAR 2020 RPAS Exploratory Research Call from 28 June 2016) EMSA and Shift2Rail IP2 activities and with other EU co-funded drone related projects and initiatives, notably under Horizon 2020 Security challenge or EDA's SARUMS activities. Proposals may include the commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency to assist or to participate in the action.
Proposals should ideally address TRLs ranging from 3 to 5.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contribute to increase safety and security of the overall civil transport system.
Contribute to enhance safe and seamless mobility of cargo and passengers.
Contribute to economic growth by unleashing new markets, new industries and new high-added value jobs in Europe while ensuring appropriate legal frameworks and advancing safety systems certification and setting standards with potential to become a global reference.
Building knowledge and acceptance within society for the steps described within U-Space.
[1]The EU regulatory framework is being set following the ""EU Aviation Strategy"" [COM/2015/0598] and the new regulation on common rules in the field of civil aviation and on the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), proposed by the Commission in December 2015 [COM(2015)0613]. The framework entails the harmonisation of regulations and standards across the European Union along with comprehensive, cohesive and conclusive demonstration of the enabling technologies."

","Research and Innovation action
","05 September 2018
","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Global as well as regional and local freight transport is massively changing due to accelerating technological changes, the establishment of new players in global trade, the rise of protectionism, and the slowing down of economic growth of important partners such as China. New logistics concepts (such as the Physical Internet) and new disruptive technologies, such as Blockchain, Industry 4.0, vehicle automation and truck platooning or new business models, like 'crowdshipping' and the circular economy models will have an impact on global freight transport, its optimisation and its environmental footprint that needs to be better understood and assessed. Furthermore new trade routes from and to Europe will probably change the traditional pattern of freight movement and will need new connections with European corridors and hubs at a time of budget limitation on investment for transport infrastructure.
Sustainable integrated multimodal freight transport is particularly important for the development of countries in special situations – least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island states and outermost regions - which face common problems resulting from the under-resourcing of transport infrastructure and services, traffic-related air pollution and high accident levels, but also diverse geopolitical and trade situations. These countries/regions also have an enormous potential for sustainable development. International cooperation can support their economies both domestically and globally for a global benefit and ensuring better integration of these regions into the world economic landscape.
Scope:
Proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:
Understanding how new concepts in logistics, in combination with new national strategies to organize freight flows in ports and airports have an impact on global freight transport, and on related greenhouse gas emissions. Multimodal transfer zones from ports and airports from long-haul to last mile logistics need to be better analysed in order to find appropriate measures and for ensuring seamless door-to-door transport, exploiting the full potential of modularization and other innovative logistics concepts. International cooperation with major trade partner countries is essential to ensure the smooth transfer at all levels of the transport chain. Proposals should also address solutions that enable peripheral regions and landlocked developing countries to have proper accessibility to international trade.
Speed up the process and transition towards the Physical Internet paradigm, demonstrating how different technologies, business cases and standards come together in real-world applications, and are able to deliver added value to the users and have positive impacts in terms of emissions and energy consumption. Priority partners should be USA, Canada, China, Japan. Demonstrations of satellite-based applications using EGNOS and Galileo are also suggested.
Research the range of new issues and questions emerging with the new trade routes to and from Europe, such as the Northern Sea Route (across an ice-free Arctic in summer months) or the new Silk Road routes and the Chinese One Belt One Road strategy; the effect of the development of these new routes on trans-continental freight modal split; the additional interfaces needed between the new overland routes and the EU internal transport networks / corridors. Priority partners are those along the routes. The geopolitical and trade aspects of these developments, in particular on countries affected by these developments, should be considered.
Understand new disruptive trends emerging as on-demand logistics solutions such as crowd-sourcing of deliveries (or ‘crowdshipping’) which have the potential to be a logistics ‘game-changer’, evidencing different impacts in both emerging and industrialized countries, including the possible integration of passengers and freight flows. Research on the crowd-sourcing of logistics would benefit from international collaboration, partly to compare the development of the phenomenon in different markets, but also to explore whether it can be extended to long-haul / cross border freight delivery, taking in consideration economic, regulatory and security constraints.
Assess the impact of emerging technologies in other sectors than freight transport (e.g. Blockchain, Industry 4.0, 5G, 3D printing, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's)) on the logistics operational system, and identify the potential development paths that lead to the optimal exploitation of their positive effect.
Collect best case models and develop decision support systems aimed at helping public authorities and private companies to determine the most likely scenarios and to promote a higher level of collaboration between the different stakeholders, including new emerging ones.
Consideration of aspects of governance, privacy and cybersecurity of and with regard to cargo.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged. In particular proposals should consider cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, Canada, China, Latin America.
In particular, proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.
Expected Impact:
Main impact from the R&I activities should be the improved integration of the European transport network (both hard – TEN-T – and soft – logistics and IT) with the global network, through the sustainable development of the transport nodes likely to benefit from the emergence of new trade routes and harmonised platforms and new and revised 'nodes', also in support of the sustainable development of new logistics routes and their link with national/regional markets. Better understanding of the impact of emerging technologies on freight flow and subsequent guidelines to optimize vehicle, infrastructure and operation accordingly. Facilitate the development of disadvantaged regions and their inclusion into the international trading system. Better understanding of links between technological development, trade and geopolitics. Research should be validated in a selected number of case studies through pilot demonstration, trials and testing involving service providers and end-users.

","28 August 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Taking into account the expected growth in transport demand and the ever-increasing customer expectations on quality of service, there is a need for a step change in the productivity of the infrastructure assets. These assets will need to be managed in a more holistic and intelligent way, using lean operational practices and smart technologies that can ultimately contribute to improving the reliability and responsiveness of customer service and the whole economics of rail transportation.
Scope: The research and innovation activities should evolve within the following three complementary work streams:
      Smart, cost-efficient, high-capacity, user-friendly rail infrastructure: proposals should aim at identifying relevant infrastructure-related challenges and developing solutions that result in reduced investment and recurring operational costs,  improve the reliability and availability of rail operations and increase the attractiveness and usability for all passenger categories (including persons with reduced mobility), while also guaranteeing the respect of strict safety standards. Infrastructure requirements stemming from new solutions for smart rail services (see MG.2.2) should be properly taken into account.
      I2M – Intelligent mobility management:proposals should focus on the development of intelligent, automated and flexible rail traffic dispatching systems, supporting an integrated approach to the optimisation of railway architecture and operational systems at network, route and individual train level (including interactions with switches). These should reconcile business and operational requirements (namely customer service, capacity, speed, timekeeping, energy, asset management) with real-time field and asset condition monitoring and intelligent traffic planning (including cross-border), to deliver normal or near-normal services during all but the most exceptional circumstances. Particular emphasis should be given to real-time data collection and analytics from trains and infrastructure for the purposes of goal-oriented predictive and adaptive control of the traffic and to minimise disturbances with a view to ensuring a minimum impact on services delivered. The interfaces and compatibility between the different rail modes (light/urban and mainline/inter-regional rail), as well as with other transport modes shall be guaranteed, including with regard to information systems. Full compatibility with European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) must be ensured.
      Energy management: the work should address innovative approaches to improve the efficiency of energy usage in rail systems, embracing vehicles, infrastructure and operation within a whole-system perspective. This will imply notably the development of smart concepts in intelligent design and management of energy systems for rail applications which should be pursued from a whole-of-life perspective - from concept to implementation through the design, procurement, manufacturing, construction, operations and maintenance phases.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 16 to 18 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Research and innovation activities are expected to result in an indicative surge in the utilisation of capacity within a range 70-90% as well as a reduction in the recurrent costs of rail operations within a range of 25-45%. Part of the lower operating costs will evolve from reductions in the power supply operational and maintenance costs (~25%), reductions in transmission and distribution losses (~20%) and increases in reliability of operation (~20%). This is to be considered, in parallel, with potential savings in investment costs for the delivery of major infrastructure projects and related systems through the adoption of lean design and implementation strategies (that may amount up to 30% of total costs).

","19 October 2017","Specific Challenge:
Waterborne transport still has huge potential in terms of energy use reduction and emission control, also and in particular with regard to existing ships. The specific challenges are to defend the lead in world markets and introduce a step change in energy efficiency and emission reductions; to explore alternative fuels through real world demonstrators; to prepare the ground for vessel electrification where sailing distances and infrastructures permit it; and to optimise the basic performance of vessels.
Scope:
In order to meet these challenges, proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
―Safe, economical, environmentally sound and practical usage of improved, alternative, low carbon and renewable fuels in waterborne transport, in particular LNG and methanol.
―Advanced energy storage and DC energy systems on-board for full and partial vessel electrification, including hybridisation.
―Development, demonstration and evaluation of innovative pollution reduction and control technologies, including solutions for remote sensing and monitoring of emissions, aspects of human behaviour and training, decision support systems, and modelling and simulation of solutions with full scale verification.
―Reduction of frictional resistance through e.g. new hull coatings, boundary-layer control devices, and air lubrication, including the development of computational and experimental techniques to demonstrate the efficiency gain.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 9 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will contribute to a more energy efficient and less polluting waterborne transport in Europe, complying with Directive 2012/33/EU, Directive 2014/94/EU and MARPOL Annex VI, in a tangible and quantifiable way through the demonstration of significant improvements in fuel efficiency (+15% compared to Best Available Technique), the demonstration to full scale of significant reductions in emissions through a variety of measures and their combinations (-80% for pollutants, -50% for greenhouse gases), and the proof of the full economic and operational feasibility of alternative fuels. Energy use reduction, in addition to its positive environmental impact, will contribute to the significant reduction of operational costs and therefore lead also to positive economic impact."

New lightweight materials and related construction principles can provide a step change in vessel efficiency, both in terms of energy use and maintenance costs. European technology leadership in this field (often held by innovative SMEs whose effective integration in the value chain is essential) needs to be translated into market demand in current and future markets, also beyond the maritime transport sector. The specific challenges are to research the functional characteristics of new lightweight and high performance materials for waterborne usages (vessels and components); to develop the most appropriate design, construction and production principles for small, medium sized and large vessels and for components (also by learning from applications in other transport modes); and to influence the regulatory environment in order to eliminate existing barriers and facilitate market take-up in the waterborne sector.
Scope:
In order to meet these challenges, proposals should address all the following aspects:
―Conception, production and use of advanced composites (including those that are bio-based or using renewable resources) and other high-performance materials, including multi-materials construction and joining / bonding.
―Comprehensive performance analysis and simulation for new advanced materials and entire constructions (including characteristics such as durability, resistance to corrosion and fouling), full life cycle costs analysis, and technology transfer from other transport applications for lightweight materials where feasible.
―Assessing risks and enhancing fire resistance properties and thermal and noise insulation qualities.

","28 August 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: A combination of rail customers’ ever-evolving requirements for passenger vehicles regarding quality of service, mounting energy costs, more stringent emissions standards, and increasing stress on the economics of rail operation is generating a new wave of challenges to rail vehicle development – notably imposing the delivery of enhanced functionality, comfort, safety, operational performance, interoperability and reduced life cycle costs. Reconciling such requirements will imply a departure from the traditional, incremental approach to vehicle development to a whole new way of thinking on product development.
Scope: Proposals should focus on innovative system approaches leading in the longer-term to the development and demonstration of a new-generation of railway vehicles and passenger trains, characterised by significant improvements in product reliability, cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness, safety and security, environmental impacts, ease of manufacture and interoperability. This will demand not only the development and integration of higher-performance technologies for critical structural components and traction, command-control and cabin environment applications (e.g. new materials, smart power and wireless technologies) but also the design and production solutions (e.g. modular, ""commercial off-the-shelf"" or adaptive concepts) that best contribute to the lean manufacturing and more efficient and safe operation of such vehicles. Proposals should also consider the development of innovative solutions to extend vehicle lifetime, or simplify retrofitting and will ensure interoperability through better Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) between the railway vehicles and the electrical installations of the network.
Attention should also be paid to the development of innovative, modular and customisable solutions for comfortable and attractive train interiors as an integral part of the whole passenger train concept. In particular, these should focus on delivering a unique traveller experience, facilitating accessibility, notably for persons with reduced mobility, fast boarding for commuters, as well as other on-board value-added services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 14 to 16 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The key goal will be to deliver a reduction of up to 40% in life cycle costs of rolling stock products, an increase in passenger train capacity up to 15%, reductions of downtime by increased reliability (up to 50%), a reduction of energy consumption (up to 30%) and an improvement in environmental performance, whilst delivering superior performance in terms of overall service quality, safety and customer experience in rail transport.

Bringing waterborne much deeper into multi-modal transport concepts, in particular to the benefit of domestic shipping and inland navigation in the EU is a necessity. The specific challenges are to overcome the traditional barriers between transport modes; to work on the greening, expansion and optimisation of the entire (waterborne) transport chain, including in the urban environment; and to contribute to the EU´s energy union through new energy transportation concepts for natural gas (in particular in short sea trades), including discharging and safety considerations. Short sea, river and canal transport can offer particular opportunities for automation (in terms of operations as well as maintenance) that can improve safety and address current employment challenges and the competitiveness of SMEs in the sector. European GNSS services can play an important role in this.
Scope:
In order to meet these challenges, proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
―New or much improved systems for waterborne operations, feedering and short sea vessels, addressing one or several of the following issues: smart connections to deep sea shipping and inland waterways transport, new unitised multi-modal cargo concepts, and reliable transport services even in extreme seasonal weather conditions.
―New cost-efficient vessel concepts for the transport and distribution of natural gas, including safe discharging.
―Automation in all waterborne operations, including in short sea trades and in inland navigation (with a view to bringing about a Digital Inland Waterway Transport Area) and in the urban environment; this may include remotely controlled and autonomous vessels and docking systems and the regulatory developments necessary to implement joint operations of conventional and unmanned vessels.

Specific challenge: Automated and progressively autonomous driving applications in road transport, actively interacting with their intelligent environment could provide an answer to the EU objective of reconciling growing mobility needs with more efficient transport operations, lower environmental impacts and increased road safety.
Automation in road transport should make best use of the evolution of Cooperative ITS and the benefits made available by satellite navigation systems, such as the increased accuracy and robustness. Connectivity and cooperative mobility will be the key driving force for integrating automation into novel mobility concepts enabled by the European Wide Service Platforms (EWSP). Security and safety aspects of these systems are also crucial
Scope: Proposals could be Research and Innovation Actions or Coordination and Support Actions.
Research and Innovation Action proposals should address one or more of the following aspects to support gradual progress towards full automation:
Dedicated supporting technologies for individual pre-emption or compensation of human errors, or even taking over the vehicle control in case of imminent collision. This could include: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to support drivers in accident avoidance and to mitigate the consequences of collisions, including tools to detect and measure undesirable or unusual driver condition (such as drowsiness) and warn, control and correct that behaviour at different levels; better optimised Human Machine Interfaces (HMI), providing tailor-made information which the driver is capable of processing in continuously changing conditions.
Novel transport, service and mobility concepts in real-life situations enabled by automated driving and connectivity. These services and concepts could benefit from cloud computing and data management and data aggregation techniques for road transport big data. They could also include automation specific to the road freight sector, including smart, secure on-board and infrastructure based-systems and seamless integration with other modes. In this context, particular attention could be given to demonstrating freight services/road trains. Attention should be paid to understanding and addressing the responses of users.
All proposals should include an assessment of the effectiveness of the relevant solutions in real life conditions based on a multi-stakeholder engagement process, in particular involving drivers. Ethical and gender issues in compensating for human errors should be duly taken into consideration.
Coordination and Support Action proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:
Dissemination and take-up of results, including the development and consensus building on business models to progress towards full automation in road transport.
Liability and standardisation policy and regulatory framework recommendations could be formulated as appropriate.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million each for Research and Innovation Actions would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

","03 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Increasing the impacts and broadening stakeholder engagement in support of transport research is an essential element to underpin the European added value from the Transport challenge of Horizon 2020.
One way to achieve this goal is to organise and participate in events that have major strategic importance.
An excellent example is the Transport Research Arena (TRA) organised in different Member States jointly with the Commission, whilst, amongst others, SMM Hamburg, the world’s largest Maritime Technology exhibition represents a valuable opportunity to broaden engagement in European Waterborne research and innovation.
Furthermore, additional targeted coordination and support activities are needed in the Inland Waterways sector and in particular with respect to the further development of the NAIADES actions and the leverage of the outcomes from related projects and to establish a bridge towards future research, innovation and implementation needs within inland waterways in.in coordination with the wider waterborne and logistics sectors.
Scope:
To address this challenge, three sub topics are proposed and proposals should address only one of the following sub-topics:
1) Innovation awards for students and senior researchers in the context of the Transport Research Arena conference - TRA 2022
The action should focus on organising two competitions for transport research and innovation awards to be assigned at the TRA conference in 2022:
A competition for students and young researchers with the goal of stimulating the interest among young researchers/students in the field of transport.
A competition for senior researchers in the field of innovative transport concepts based on results from EU-funded projects only.
Both competitions should cover all transport modes and cross-cutting issues (technological, socio-economic and behavioural aspects) in line with the EU policy objectives for smart, green and integrated transport. The organisation of these awards should ensure high-quality competition and very good media coverage before, during and after the TRA conference. The action should give particular attention to gender issues.
The awards shall be widely promoted, including within press articles and via important trade publications. Particularly for the student award, wide pan European participation is expected and should be facilitated through engagement with relevant professional associations, their publications and other related student organisations.
2) Broadening Engagement and increasing impact from Waterborne transport research
The waterborne sector is highly fragmented, with diverse actors and administrative structures, covering ports, maritime and inland shipping. The resulting barriers inhibit innovation and the necessary R&I dialogue to maximise impact. To address this, the following activities should be foreseen:
Together with Commission services and the broader waterborne sector, identify the information gaps concerning, innovation needs, awareness of outcomes and opportunities for participation and on this basis devise a communication strategy to be implemented over the course of the project.
Develop KPIs and benchmark these at the outset and use to monitor progress throughout the project.
Broaden lasting awareness and increase the impact from EU waterborne research through prominent participation within large strategic maritime and inland waterway events such as SMM Hamburg in 2022 and 2024 and for example promote waterborne innovation in overall strategic transport events, stakeholder exercises and the creation of durable engagement with potential public and private users.
Produce high quality digital and printed dissemination materials concerning the scope and success stories arising from EU waterborne research. This should include a short video presenting the challenges, innovation needs and successes.
3) Towards an implementation of the future inland navigation action programme
The action should focus on consolidating the Inland Waterways Transport (IWT) knowledge network and partnership, which was previously established with the support of FP7. In this respect, it should ensure a solid knowledge basis for the implementation of any future NAIADES programme. The coordination and support action will build on the results of previous work and will reflect the multi-disciplinary requirements and complexity of the subject, coordinating with the wider waterborne, land transport and logistics communities. The coordination action will be organised around the five NAIADES 2 action areas, but will also take into account the results of the NAIADES 2 progress report (adopted 18.09.2018[1]) and other related activities. The coordination action will, in close cooperation with the European Commission, set up a roadmap for the implementation of actions not yet started or to be finalised and ensure the support to permanent-type of actions. It will identify the appropriate measures and define the necessary means and tools. In coordination with the Waterborne technology platform, the action will further develop a R&D roadmap by integrating all stakeholders and will also develop the implementation plan. Also in coordination with the Waterborne technology platform, the project will also monitor the inland navigation R&D projects and their impacts from relevant European programmes. The project will also identify barriers for the deployment of research results, market uptake and improvement of framework conditions to increase innovation in inland waterway transport. A particular focus will be to address the need to decarbonise and improve the environmental performance of inland waterway transport, particularly when operating close to urban areas, as well as on future-proof infrastructure, compatible with digital and automation developments under a changing climate.
This coordination and support action will ensure an active participation of key industrial stakeholders, the Waterborne Technology Platform, Member States administrations, industry associations and river commissions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 0.7 million for sub-topic 1); of up to EUR 1.3 million for sub topic 2) and of up to EUR 2 million for sub topic 3) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contribute to a wide dissemination of the results of European transport research, broaden stakeholder engagement and raise the visibility and weight of the EU policy in the field.
Increase the attractiveness of transport related studies and reinforce the pursuit of excellence and impact in European transport research and innovation, by giving recognition and visibility to the best achievements.
Creating links and exchanges between research and innovation stakeholders and policy makers, thus improving the development and deployment of innovative solutions for transport in Europe.

","15 October 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: Automated and progressively autonomous driving applications in road transport, actively interacting with their intelligent environment could provide an answer to the EU objective of reconciling growing mobility needs with more efficient transport operations, lower environmental impacts and increased road safety.
Automation in road transport should make best use of the evolution of Cooperative ITS and the benefits made available by satellite navigation systems, such as the increased accuracy and robustness. Connectivity and cooperative mobility will be the key driving force for integrating automation into novel mobility concepts enabled by the European Wide Service Platforms (EWSP). Security and safety aspects of these systems are also crucial
Scope: Proposals could be Research and Innovation Actions or Coordination and Support Actions.
Research and Innovation Action proposals should address one or more of the following aspects to support gradual progress towards full automation:
      Dedicated supporting technologies for individual pre-emption or compensation of human errors, or even taking over the vehicle control in case of imminent collision. This could include:  Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to support drivers in accident avoidance and to mitigate the consequences of collisions, including tools to detect and measure undesirable or unusual driver condition (such as drowsiness) and warn, control and correct that behaviour at different levels; better optimised Human Machine Interfaces (HMI), providing tailor-made information which the driver is capable of processing in continuously changing conditions.
      Novel transport, service and mobility concepts in real-life situations enabled by automated driving and connectivity. These services and concepts could benefit from cloud computing and data management and data aggregation techniques for road transport big data. They could also include automation specific to the road freight sector, including smart, secure on-board and infrastructure based-systems and seamless integration with other modes. In this context, particular attention could be given to demonstrating freight services/road trains. Attention should be paid to understanding and addressing the responses of users.
All proposals should include an assessment of the effectiveness of the relevant solutions in real life conditions based on a multi-stakeholder engagement process, in particular involving drivers. Ethical and gender issues in compensating for human errors should be duly taken into consideration.
Coordination and Support Action proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:
      Dissemination and take-up of results, including the development and consensus building on business models to progress towards full automation in road transport.
      Liability and standardisation policy and regulatory framework recommendations could be formulated as appropriate.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million each for Research and Innovation Actions would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Projects should contribute to:
      Reduction of the automated driving systems’ development costs, as well as raising competitiveness of the European industry in developing breakthrough technological solutions.
      Enhanced robustness and performance of sensor and data analysis systems and optimised HMI and advice strategies together with unobtrusive methods for measuring workload, distraction and fatigue.
      Improved efficiency, safety and traffic flow through better use of the existing infrastructure capacity, and reduction of emissions.

","Coordination and support action
","15 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Market demand for sustainable urban mobility solutions can be boosted by increasing purchaser (and indirectly end-user) awareness about technologies and processes used in implementing sustainable urban solutions. Urban areas concentrate demand for sustainable transport and mobility solutions (such as alternatively fuelled vehicles and supporting (refuelling) infrastructure) by public procurers. The procurement of innovation can support the broad market take-up of innovative solutions through the jointly planning (across borders) demand created by public procurers.
Scope:
Under this topic, support should be provided for the establishment of a number of cross-border networking activities that plan future public procurements of innovation (PPI[1]) and/or pre-commercial procurements (PCP[2]) of solutions that result in sustainable urban mobility, including vehicles corresponding to alternative fuels infrastructure as legislated in Directive 2014/94. Also actions funded here could complement those funded in the ELENA instrument in two ways: the preparatory public procurement activities funded in this topic could lead to ELENA applications, or the implementation of an ELENA action could be supported as part of the actions funded in this topic.
Proposals should be driven by clearly identified needs of the procurers, including life-cycle and cost-benefit assessments. It is envisaged that there will be a fairly small (about 5-10 organisations) consortium of public procurers that organises dissemination activities for a larger group of public procurers. Clear commitments from participants for a further Europe-wide take-up and rollout of results during and following the project are expected. Proposals could include new approaches for market consultations with suppliers, paying special attention to SME suppliers. Proposals should consider where possible strategies to plan and implement joint, cross-border procurement of solutions that are not yet available on a large-scale commercial basis and which entail a higher risk than purchasing products that are already commercially widely available.
Consortia should consist of public procurers or a group or multiple groups thereof, i.e. contracting authorities in the meaning of the public procurement Directives at all levels (local, regional, national and supra-national) that plan to establish implementation plans for improving the quality and efficiency of their public service offering by procurement of innovative solutions[3] for use in cities and communities. This includes both contracting authorities in the meaning of the public procurement directive for public authorities (2004/18/EC) and utilities (2004/17/EC), for example public transport operators, relevant ministries, utilities, communes and cities, police or fire brigades, e-government administrations, etc.
The activities funded by the topic do not finance the actual procurement(s) made by project consortia or their members.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.6 to 1 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions will lead to:
―An executed plan over the project lifetime that contains at least the following:1) better harmonised (between the various procurers) and articulated technical specifications; and 2) new, joint approaches for doing the competitive dialogue and defining award criteria in the specific area(s) of common purchasing needs.
―Setting up 'buyers groups' of public procurers that undertake joint, cross-border or coordinated procurements.
―Exchanging experience in procurement practices and strategies (organising trainings and other information exchange tools) in the specific area(s) of common purchasing needs.
―A set of well-documented practices available for replication
―Increased awareness, capacity building and a demonstrated, increased public purchasing of innovative urban mobility solutions.

","15 October 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: The European maritime technologies industry is facing fierce global competition on price in its traditional markets which forces it to shift its focus to profitable (existing and new) markets where technical excellence and smart custom-made solutions are the key to market success. In order to develop these niche markets and exploit them successfully, research and innovation efforts are required that introduce new design and production processes with the aim of having minimal total costs over the useful economic life of the product which, for waterborne assets (vessels and maritime structures), is particularly long (20-50 years). This includes considerations on the impact of the circular economy approach to these assets and their technical and material composition.
Scope: Proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
      New design and mathematical modelling tools and paradigms supporting the full understanding of operational practices and situations covering the entire useful economic life of a vessel or maritime structure (including material recovery, ""from cradle to cradle"") in terms of costs and performance.
      A comprehensive and detailed approach to system integration and optimisation for vessels which is multi-objective driven, based on virtual product (digital mock-up) methodologies (with virtual reality capabilities). The resulting model must include all technical systems and sub-systems and must cover all operational conditions of the complete system over the entire life cycle (thus taking into account the uncertainties of the future operating context). Modelling should cover the majority of ship types produced in Europe and should be based on the new tools and paradigms, allowing for short lead times and the optimised use in SME yards building complex vessels.
      A large scale virtual demonstrator for smart, adaptive and multi-material complex ships and structures, based on the design tools and concepts for minimised life-cycle costs and using the complete product model.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 8 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
      Achieve measurable cost reductions in design, production and lifetime maritime asset management.
      Facilitate a shorter time for assessment and integration of sub-systems on board vessels and a better integration of complex systems, in particular in relation with energy issues and efficient operations. This should lead to efficiency gains of 20% in terms of energy consumption and of 10% in terms of other operational costs.

Better and more effective integration of urban nodes into TEN-T corridors could address issues around integration of efficient and sustainable (e.g. using alternative fuel vehicles) solutions for 'last mile' delivery; greater use of intermodal urban freight logistics, and approaches for linking long-distance with last-mile freight delivery in urban areas.
The efficient and effective integration of urban nodes into TEN-T corridors requires further research and innovation efforts for the development and related recommendations for deployment of innovative solutions in urban areas.
Scope:
One or two expert networks should be set up that develop current practices and opportunities, and produce recommendations. These expert networks could focus on how to deploy novel combinations of existing technologies/ services and involve new combinations of different stakeholder groupings, for example from research and innovation programmes, from urban planning, from infrastructure constructors and operators and from financiers, with a great emphasis on creating synergies between results of Horizon 2020 funded projects and CEF funding.
This topic will complement topic MG-5.1-2016 (Networked and efficient logistics clusters) in this Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The main impacts will be validated recommendations for wide-scale deployment of research and innovation solutions in some (if justified, a selection could be made) or all urban nodes along the TEN-T[1] corridors. These recommendations should also define funding needs and instruments for creating synergies, and promoting exploitation of results, between Horizon 2020 (and previous Framework Programmes) and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)[2] (e.g. by scaling up R&I results). TEN-T policy, both through ""non-financial"" action of the European Coordinators and funding under CEF can pick up these concepts and recommendations and potentially fund implementation-related studies, pilot action and works. The recommendations should also take into account socio-economic aspects of deployment of innovations.

In a logistics sector with highly increased collaboration, intermodal and dynamic re-routing of freight, there is a need to exploit ICT advances such as Internet-of-Things, big data, new satellite navigation infrastructure and Intelligent Transport Systems with changes in business needs. We need to rethink the way we plan, book and execute freight flows, new systems should provide all stakeholders with reliable information and allow exploitation of the full potential of horizontal collaboration. Furthermore we will need to match the increased need for real-time and open data to plan and track shared freight with guarantees that the exploitation of this data is both safe and secure. Given the vast number small and medium sized enterprises active in the transport sector this project should have a clear focus on the ease of access to all future ICT solutions. To maximise the impact of data sharing, it is vital to also consider the needs and policies of all public stakeholders (cities, regions, road operators, customs authorities, etc.).
Scope:
Building on previous work in the e-Freight domain (including developments on rail TAF TSI, road ITS, inland waterways RIS, maritime SafeSeaNet, European GNNS programmes and aviation SESAR) and on the work of the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum[1], proposals should cover the development and integration of at least 2 of the 3 following issues:
A) Planning and data
―Develop electronic booking and planning systems for freight to find the best (combinations of) modes and optimal route (e.g. GNSS based route analysis or opportunities for “milk runs”), to progress towards a completely paperless environment and freight traceability information allowing better network exploitation and more efficient logistics operations.
―Identify opportunities for increased availability of freight data (such as shipments, volumes, statuses, destinations, etc.) taking into account security, privacy, data ownership and policies for data sharing[2].
―Develop algorithms to increase both load factors and optimise the planned delivery route, based on the specifications of Modular Load Units, the vehicle or container and all required destinations.
B) Dynamic routing and business models
―Develop event management systems that create visibility and transparency and allow real-time exception management for faster traffic reconfiguration and increased resilience.
―Develop business models for dynamic transport services (e.g. cargo was automatically switched between barge and train because a truck encountered traffic congestions and was late at the hub).
C) Interoperability and everything connected
―Develop simple connection tools that allow low-cost integration of SMEs in the supply chain, offering two-way communication and allowing both efficient planning of their part of the supply chain and giving feedback to other stakeholders.
―Integrate simple and cost effective sensors or smart devices (IoT, ITS) into supply chain data management tools.
―Harmonise interoperability between supply chain partners, allowing easy information sharing and creating trust in the complexity of multi-modal transport. Solutions should link all public and private stakeholders.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To realise the full potential of horizontal collaboration, real time data and high interoperability, actions are expected to demonstrate how the following aspects will be achieved:
―Better, more flexible integration of ICT solutions and operational processes, linking the digital and physical flows.
―Seamless freight transport execution across Member States and modes of transport.
―Increased reliability and reduced transit times.
―10% higher load factors and 10% shorter delivery routes resulting in respective reductions in fuel consumption and in lower emissions.

In Europe, but also in other parts of the world, actions to reduce the carbon footprint of transport and logistics services as part of an integrated supply chain are gaining momentum because the industry sees this as an important domain of competition. However, there needs to be a level playing field amongst companies in Europe, and even world-wide, as regards transparency and comparability of methodologies and data used, including alignment with carbon footprint reporting from other elements of the supply chain. At the moment, the existence of different standards, initiatives and calculation tools, each with its own underlying methodology and data, makes carbon footprints practically incomparable thus hampering potential efficiency gains that would result from this measure.
The specific challenge is the establishment of a co-ordinated network, gathering regional, national and international activities and fostering communication, collaboration and consensus-building on harmonised methodologies for carbon footprint calculation along the transport supply chain. The network would also support the implementation of concrete actions in terms of carbon footprint measurement and reporting.
The work should be inclusive of the state of the art of ideas, trials and business endeavours on new mobility concepts and build on previous projects, as well as other relevant European and non-European initiatives, and with full consideration of the CEN 16258 standard.
Scope:
Proposals should address all the following issues:
―Liaison with standardisation organisations, shippers, transport operators, logistic service providers, transport and trade organisations and other initiatives with a view to align existing methodologies and interpretative rules (with particular reference to CEN 16258) at the European, and preferably at the global level
―Develop, improve and/or harmonise guidelines for the measurement and reporting of emissions from freight transport services, based preferably on Scope 3 standard[1] and real world data (where possible).
―Develop mechanisms to facilitate and standardise data collection, handling, reporting and monitoring, with particular reference to data sensitivity issues.
―Evaluate real world testing and implementation of carbon footprint calculations through case studies.
―Certification of methodology and accuracy of calculations.
―Design educational tools, including training sessions on carbon foot printing of freight transport and logistics services.
―Explore conditions and develop a blueprint for the introduction of carbon foot printing certification schemes (eco-labelling).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To lower the carbon footprint of transport and logistics services, actions are expected to demonstrate how the following aspects will be achieved:
―Collaborative strategies among industry and authorities for win-win solutions for transport and logistics services: greener while not more costly.
―Streamlined business processes and efficiency gains.
―Fair competition and transparent carbon footprint calculations of transport and logistics services.
―A sound proposal for introducing an eco-label for freight transport and logistics services

Specific challenge: Although the application of technology has been the primary means of reducing the environmental impacts of transport in the last two decades, technical solutions alone cannot solve all the economic, environmental and societal problems Europe is currently facing.
Multimodal integrated travel information, planning and ticketing services could play a significant role in improving modal integration, thus increasing the attractiveness of collective mobility and transport modes alternative to road and hence be inclusive of user group specific needs (including cyclists or pedestrians). However, the current fragmentation of the landscape in this field, including dispersed knowledge and lack of cooperation between various stakeholders involved in service provision, does not allow the user to easily organise a door-to-door pan-European intermodal trip while taking into account the emissions that will be caused by a specific travel choice.
It also constitutes a major barrier in developing and enacting a truly comprehensive and cohesive strategy for ITS deployment in Europe.
Scope: Proposals should focus on one or several of the following domains:
      Interoperability and linking of the existing services, including necessary interfaces, in order to achieve the widest possible geographical and modal coverage to enable an open single European market for mobility services. The scope of the work should extend towards full-scale early take up and solutions should be tested on large scale.
      Developing EU-wide common minimum standards for interoperable navigation and ticketing services, thereby facilitating regional solutions compatible with generic nomad devices (smart phones etc.).
      Exploring more effective and more efficient cooperation and decision making mechanisms between stakeholders, including coordination of the existing European, national and regional initiatives, to foster EU-wide consolidation and deployment of high-quality integrated multimodal travel information, planning and ticketing services. This could encompass setting up a cooperation platform.
      Exploring mechanisms and structures for consensus building among stakeholders to foster EU-wide consolidation and deployment of cooperative ITS. This could encompass setting up a cooperation platform.
      Exploring ways to overcome the fragmentation of knowledge with regard to ITS deployment across the EU, by setting up a dedicated observatory monitoring all major developments in ITS deployment across Europe, to facilitate fact-based policy making at all levels and to engage a large number of local authorities and industrial stakeholders. Special attention should be paid to broad coverage both in geographical and thematic terms.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million each for Research and Innovation Actions would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The work should contribute to:
      Better modal integration by providing travellers with information about various options to travel from A to B according to their needs, thus improving European citizens' mobility in general with increased awareness of the ecological footprint of their journey.
      Increased travel time reliability.
      More efficient use of the existing transport infrastructure.
      More inclusive transport services across Europe by better responding to the special needs of population groups such as the elderly and disabled travellers.
      Better informed and more efficient policies for ITS deployment based on consolidated knowledge on the state of play across Europe and thus accelerated roll-out of the related services and technologies.

Specific challenge:Increasing the performance of multi-modal transport infrastructurecan be achieved through improving the productivity of the assets. In this context, key in the future will be to reduce drastically traffic disruptions of transport flows from inspection, construction and maintenance activities to accommodate increasing/changing traffic demand. This means fewer, faster, more sustainable and better planned interventions with maximum safety for the workers and other traffic participants.
Scope:Proposals should address one or several of the following activities:
      Advanced, quick, cost-effective and flexible (modular) design, manufacturing, construction, maintenance, rehabilitation and retrofitting systems/techniques and materials.
      Self-monitoring, self-reporting, non-intrusive inspection and testing methods, including advanced predictive modelling.
      Reuse and recycling methods for low energy construction and maintenance of existing infrastructure.
Research in this domain should aim at validation of innovative solutions, targeting specific European geographical areas where either new construction for the completion of an efficient transport network is needed, or advanced maintenance systems are necessary to improve and extend the capacity of the existing network.
Proposals could also include, when suitable, novel design concepts, such as shared space, self-explaining infrastructure, forgiving road sides.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation with third countries is encouraged, both with international partners willing to share advanced know-how, and with third parties (in particular neighbouring countries) needing technology transfer.
SME active participation is strongly encouraged with the aim of fostering open innovation.
New procedures and technologies in using Green Infrastructure to make transport infrastructure more resilient, less-carbon intense, maximising multiple ecosystem services and minimising fragmentation effects should be developed and tested.
Proposals can either focus on technological progress and further advancement in knowledge (Research and Innovation Actions) or on reinforcing networking among operators in all modes with a view to enhance the effectiveness of the sector (Coordination and Support Actions). Proposals should ensure coherence and avoid duplication of efforts with the INFRAVATION EraNet+.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 5 million each for Research and Innovation Actions, and EUR 0.5 to 1.0 million each for Coordination and Support Actions, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals are expected to deliver the following results:
      Monitoring and management systems increasing infrastructure capacity and optimising maintenance costs for all transport modes.
      New construction and maintenance techniques that enhance the performance and reliability of infrastructure.
      Provide innovative and cost-saving approaches to use Green Infrastructure for transport.
      Extending the life span of ageing transport infrastructure.
      Development and application of effective and efficient materials, technologies and tools to meet cost-effectiveness and sustainability goals.
      Reduction of multi-modal infrastructure construction and maintenance energy intensity and subsequent CO2, pollutants and noise emissions.
The work in this area should support the transition towards zero traffic disruption from inspection, construction and maintenance by 2030 and boost the overall performance of European transport infrastructure and reduce nuisances generated by transport, such as noise.

","Coordination and support action
","01 June 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To promote transport research in Europe by supporting the organisation of the Transport Research Arena (TRA) Conference in 2020.
Scope:
The action will prepare and provide support to the Transport Research Arena Conference (TRA) to be organised in 2020. TRA is the European Transport Research conference which brings together representatives of transport stakeholders from all over Europe and beyond around research and innovation results and policy.
The objective of the conference is to provide a platform for discussion of political, industrial, research and policy issues on a European and global scene, which pursues a smart combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches. In line with previous TRA conferences, the event should address the technological and industrial developments of the transport sector (road, rail, waterborne and aviation sectors and also cross-modal aspects) providing a high-level, future oriented perspective coming from policy, the industrial and research communities, in response to Europe’s social needs and expectations.
In collaboration with the relevant actors, such as the European Commission services, the different European Technology Platforms (ERTRAC for road, ERRAC for rail, WATERBORNE TP for waterborne, ALICE for logistics and ACARE for aeronautics) and also previous TRA conference organisers in order to maintain continuity, the action will define the overall planning of the conference, structure the technical and political sessions of the event, contribute to select the appropriate location for the venue and offer operational IT tools for the registration of participants, the handling of speakers’ contributions, contribute to the organisation of logistics for the event, etc. Support to the organisation of demonstration activities should also be foreseen.
In order to participate and receive funding for this action, proposals must be accompanied by a written endorsement from the relevant Ministry of the Country where the conference will take place. A financial plan to organise the event should be attached.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0,5 and 0,7 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action will support the overall organisation of TRA 2020 and will therefore contribute to a wide dissemination of the results of European transport research and will raise the visibility and weight of the EU policy in the field.
It will facilitate the creation of links and exchanges between research and innovation stakeholders and policy makers, thus improving the development and deployment of innovative solutions for transport in Europe.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) and will be implemented by the Commission services."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Objective:
The Innovative Training Networks (ITN) aim to train a new generation of creative, entrepreneurial and innovative early-stage researchers, able to face current and future challenges and to convert knowledge and ideas into products and services for economic and social benefit.
ITN will raise excellence and structure research and doctoral training in Europe (EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries), extending the traditional academic research training setting, incorporating elements of Open Science and equipping researchers with the right combination of research-related and transferable competences. It will provide enhanced career perspectives in both the academic and non-academic sectors through international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility combined with an innovation-oriented mind-set.
Scope:
ITN supports competitively selected joint research training and/or doctoral programmes, implemented by partnerships of universities, research institutions, research infrastructures, businesses, SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe and beyond.
Partnerships take the form of collaborative European Training Networks (ETN), European Industrial Doctorates (EID) or European Joint Doctorates (EJD).
Each programme should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training and establishing active and continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.
The programme should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations, and enable sharing of knowledge, networking activities, the organisation of workshops and conferences.
Training responds to well identified needs in defined research areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follows the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training. It should be primarily focused on scientific and technological knowledge through research on individual, personalised projects.
In order to increase the employability of the researchers, the research training should be complemented by the meaningful exposure of each researcher to the non-academic sector. Secondments of the researcher to other beneficiaries and partner organisations are encouraged, but should be relevant, feasible, beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives.
Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship will be supported.
In order to reflect the new modus operandi of research supporting the development of open science, training should prepare early-stage researchers for increased research collaborations and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to research data, FAIR[1] data management, public engagement and citizen science, etc.).
A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and each early-stage researcher recruited by the selected network. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences.
Attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for EJD and for EID, and encouraged in ETN. In EID, the joint supervision of the researcher must be ensured by at least one supervisor from the academic sector and one supervisor from the non-academic sector. These arrangements will be taken into account during the evaluation of the proposal.
In EID and EJD, fellowships offered to early-stage researchers should lead to a doctoral degree. EJD result in joint[2], double or multiple doctoral degrees[3] awarded by institutions from at least two different countries, primarily within Europe (EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries).
In EID and EJD, enrolment in a doctoral programme and the creation of a joint governance structure - with joint admission (EJD only), selection, supervision, monitoring and assessment procedures - is mandatory. These arrangements will be taken into account during the evaluation of the proposal.
Expected Impact:
At researcher level:
Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved employability and career prospects both in and outside academia (leading in the longer-term to more successful careers)

Objective:
Facilitate trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) for the Marie
Skłodowska-Curie actions (MSCA), with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and
raising the general standard of support to applicants, taking into account the diversity of
actors.
Scope:
Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of MSCA. The
activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs
concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops,
enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training sessions linked to MSCA as well as to
gender dimension of Research and Innovation, twinning schemes, etc. Special attention will
be given to enhancing the competence of MSCA NCPs, including helping less experienced
NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. It will be also
encouraged to build up cooperation with other networks to increase visibility to potential
beneficiaries, especially in the non-academic sector.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to MSCA and should not duplicate actions
foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under 'Science with
and for Society'.
Only NCPs host organisations from EU Member States, Associated Countries, and third
countries which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible
to participate in and receive funding for this action.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated
Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and
the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to
participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium
for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the
estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic.
Expected impact:
• An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, therefore helping simplify
access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the
average quality of submitted proposals.
• A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Objective:
The RISE scheme promotes international and cross-sector collaboration through exchanging research and innovation staff, and sharing knowledge and ideas from research to market (and vice-versa).
The scheme fosters a shared culture of research and innovation that welcomes and rewards creativity and entrepreneurship and helps to turn creative ideas into innovative products, services or processes.
Scope:
RISE involves organisations from the academic and non-academic sectors (in particular SMEs), based in Europe (EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries) and outside Europe (third countries).
Support is provided for the development of partnerships in the form of a joint research and innovation project. This is aimed at knowledge sharing via international as well as intersectoral mobility, based on secondments of research and innovation staff (exchanges) with an in-built return mechanism.
The organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a joint research and innovation project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. Secondments shall always take place between legal entities independent from each other[1].
RISE should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations, as well as other synergies, and enable networking activities, organisation of workshops and conferences to facilitate sharing of knowledge, new skills acquisition and career development for research and innovation staff members.
RISE proposals can focus either on one dimension of mobility (intersectoral / international), or include a combination of both.
Exchanges can be for both early-stage and experienced researchers and can also include administrative, managerial and technical staff directly involved in the research and innovation activities of the proposal.
Support for the exchanges between institutions within Europe (EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries) covers only intersectoral secondments.
Exchanges with institutions from and to third countries can be intersectoral as well as within the same sector.
Secondments between institutions established in third countries or within the same EU Member State or Horizon 2020 Associated Country will not be supported.
Expected Impact:
At staff member level:
Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved employability and career prospects both in and outside academia
Increase in higher impact R&I output, more knowledge and ideas converted into products and services
Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society
At organisation level:
Enhanced cooperation and transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines
Strengthening of international and intersectoral collaborative networks
Boosting of R&I capacity among participating organisations
At system level:
Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in Europe
Strengthening of Europe's human capital base in R&I
Increase in Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for R&I
Better quality R&I contributing to Europe's competitiveness and growth

Objectives
The objective of this call for proposals is to support the establishment and implementation of Maritime Spatial Plans in line with the objectives pursued in the framework of the MSP Directive. More specifically, this action intends to support Member States in setting up maritime spatial plans and ensuring that plans are coherent and coordinated across marine regions concerned. The deadline for Member States to adopt their Maritime Spatial Plans is 31 March 2021.
In this context, applicants are required to address the following priorities in their proposals:
Support the work of MSP competent authorities and/or inter-ministerial bodies in the establishment and adoption of maritime spatial plans;
Where relevant, support the development of cross-border cooperation on MSP with bordering Member States and third countries with a view to ensure that maritime spatial plans are coherent and coordinated across marine regions concerned;
Making use of the best available data and organise the sharing of information, necessary for maritime spatial plans, by using relevant mechanism and tools (e.g. INSPIRE, EMODNet).
Themes & priorities
Proposals are expected to develop innovative responses to tackle specific challenges that EU Members States might encounter when preparing, establishing or revising their maritime spatial plans.
These challenges should be common to the Member States participating in the project. The shared interest in developing innovative responses can apply within a sea basin and/or across sea basins. This means that a proposal could bring together participants from different Member States, located in different sea basins.
Hereunder is a non-exhaustive list of examples of such challenges/issues:
Climate proofing of MSP: incorporating adaptation and mitigation actions and/or strategies into MSP, making MSP flexible and adaptive to respond to climate change.
MSP as an enabler of the EU's ""Green Deal"": development of a clean, circular blue economy, preserving and protecting biodiversity in the marine environment (in particular with spatial measures), facilitating the supply of clean, affordable and secure, energy, enabling the provision of healthy and environmentally-friendly food from the sea.
Development of an economic sector (e.g. tourism, offshore wind energy, aquaculture) in the maritime domain: ex-ante assessments (Strategic Environmental Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment), allocation of sufficient sea space, resolution of conflicts with other uses, enabling synergies with other sectors / activities, etc.
Applying the Ecosystems Based Approach (EBA) in MSP: designing maritime spatial plans to integrate objectives and measures of other EU instruments (e.g. the Marine Strategy Framework Directive[1]) with the aim to reduce collective pressures and ensuring that marine ecosystems are in a healthy, productive and resilient condition.
Addressing gaps and challenges in the collection and use of data in the MSP context: using best available data and instruments to prepare, monitor and revise maritime spatial plans. Developing data tools, models and infrastructures, allowing for interoperability and enabling Member States to share MSP data and information, especially in a cross-border and sea basin context.
Promoting ocean governance through MSP: incorporating oceans' governance tools into the MSP process and in maritime spatial plans. For example by enabling stakeholder participation in governance schemes and instruments (e.g. management of marine resources, protection of the environment or of the underwater cultural heritage) or by promoting cooperation with third countries in issues of common interest in a sea basin or a shared ocean space.
The above list is purely illustrative and applicants might identify other challenges that are specific to them, or to the sea basin(s) where they are located.
Applicants should identify one(or maximum two), challenge(s) and build their proposal around the response(s) to such challenge(s).
At least one project per topic is expected to be funded.
Priority will be given to proposals that build on the outcome of prior MSP related projects, relevant to the objectives of the call. In this context, proposals should describe how they build on, complement and differ from finalised or ongoing research and innovation projects, including from EU programmes, where relevant. In case a proposal includes activities a particular sea basin in which a dedicated sea basin strategy or similar initiative exists[2], priority will be given to proposals that explain how they contribute to the objectives of the relevant sea basin strategy or initiative.
Scope:
Activities that can be funded
Applicants should explain in their proposal how they will implement the targeted activities below described, resulting in concrete and measurable results within the project's duration.
Projects must undertake one or more of the following main activities as part of the project implementation:
Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in articles 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the MSP Directive (notably the setting-up and adoption of maritime spatial plans);
Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in article 10 of the MSP Directive (Data use and sharing);
Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in article 11 of the MSP Directive (Cooperation among Member States);
Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in article 12 of the MSP Directive (Cooperation with third countries).
In addition, applicants should include in their project the following complementary activities/tasks to support the above core activities:
Establishment of a Steering Committee (SC) to ensure the overall strategic steering of the project. The SC should comprise relevant representatives of the Member States where the action takes place (such as MSP competent authorities), as well as the beneficiaries involved. The Commission and EASME may participate in an observer capacity only.
Establishment of an Advisory Committee (AC) to provide expert advice on the project's activities. The AC should be composed of a maximum of five recognised experts in MSP or in relevant fields of activity. The Commission and EASME may participate in an observer capacity only.
Working procedures defining how the project and the SC will operate (assigning clear roles and responsibilities, describing the decision-making process, frequency of meetings etc.);
An opening and closing conference.
Applicants are strongly encouraged to assign dedicated staff to the development and implementation of the proposed communication and dissemination activities. This should be appropriately reflected in the proposed budget.
The list of complementary activities is non-exhaustive. Applicants may propose additional activities, as long as the proposed complementary activity is justified and establishes a coherent link with the project objectives and the objectives of this call.
Networking with other EU projects
During the lifetime of the projects financed under this action, a number of events (no more than once per year) may be organised at EU level for the grant beneficiaries to facilitate the exchange of experience and good practices across sea basins, to foster mutual learning and to enhance the European dimension of Maritime Spatial Planning. Project beneficiaries are expected to participate in these events, which will be held in Brussels or other relevant locations.

Specific Challenge: The fast and reliable prediction of severe accident progression and the anticipation of the source term in case of severe accident is of paramount importance for the protection of people in triggering the appropriate response to a nuclear emergency. The need to improve the tools for predicting the plant status and the source term has been identified as a priority following the Fukushima accident as it gives input to accident management strategies and for dose projection caused by atmospheric releases.
Scope: For use in emergency operation centres, this tool should be adapted to all types of reactors in operation or foreseeable in the EU. Furthermore, this tool should be able to predict the different possible accidental scenarios and provide results in a fast and user-friendly way. Such tool should start with minimal input data from nuclear power plants but be able to incorporate additional refinement as more information becomes available in order to improve predictions. It should also rely on state of the art knowledge on severe accident phenomenology and mitigation measures in order to give results with enough accuracy, confidence and reduced uncertainties. International cooperation with notably Japan, the United States of America, Ukraine and the Russian Federation would be beneficial in this area and will be considered during evaluation.
Expected impact: This research will first of all lead to reinforcing nuclear safety through improved accident management procedures that will ensure a faster and site specific response to nuclear emergencies. The tool to be developed is also to be used for the further assessment of existing severe accident management guidelines. It will improve the availability and reliability of dose projection caused by atmospheric releases following a nuclear accident and respond to the need identified as a priority following the Fukushima accident. In the long term, it is also expected that this research will lead to a further exchange of approaches in this domain at EU level and to the reinforcing of EU leadership in reactor safety technology and nuclear emergency management.
Type of action: Research and innovation actions.

Specific Challenge: The Radioactive Waste Management Directive (2011/70/Euratom), which was adopted in 2011, requires each Member State to inter alia carry out research activities. Member States' research in this field is aligned with national timeframes to implementing technical solutions for geological disposal facilities. The immediate challenge is to address uncertainties about the safety of such facilities, to build a sound safety case, special attention being paid to stakeholders' concerns regarding all ultimate radioactive waste materials to be disposed of. It is also necessary to maintain scientific competence to demonstrate the safe operation of facilities. Taking into account the scope of IGDTP, this action should exploit synergies between industry, implementers, Technical Safety Organisations (TSO), policy makers and the research community.
Scope: The aim is to develop synergies and increase coordination of national research programmes in the field of management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. This action includes the reviewing of all strategic aspects linked to a stepwise move to joint programming in this field. For this purpose, it should seek to involve as many entities as possible that are active in the management and disposal of radioactive waste, notably most relevant public or industry-funded research programmes, industry, implementers, TSO and policy makers while not confusing their respective roles.
Expected impact: This action will lead to the further integration of the concerned research community and hence help maintaining and developing EU leadership in knowledge and expertise for innovative and publicly acceptable radioactive waste management solutions. Moreover, it will further reinforce and make more effective the interaction at EU level between industry, implementers, TSO, policy makers and the research community, which is of particular importance for the implementing of solutions for the final disposal of radioactive waste.

Specific Challenge: Radiation protection aims at protecting people and the environment from the potentially harmful effects of ionising radiation. It is of particular interest in the context of the rehabilitation of contaminated territories following an accident, as well as the protection of people and the environment during normal operation. The deep understanding of the effects of ionising radiations is also necessary for drawing maximum benefits from the adequate use of these in medical and industrial applications. Contrary to high dose, the risks from low dose of radiation, including its interaction with other risk factors, are poorly understood. A reinforced multidisciplinary approach to research and innovation is considered as essential to further develop the knowledge base in this field. This approach should encompass a number of basic scientific disciplines besides the specific disciplines pertaining to radiation protection so far, such as emergency preparedness, radioecology or the medical use of ionising radiation. It will require cooperation of the entire European research community concerned with a view to exploit to the best extend the synergistic aspects amongst these different disciplines.
Scope: This activity will build on the Strategic Research Agendas of MELODI[1], NERIS[2] and ALLIANCE[3], while also making use of other existing expertise in Europe, notably regarding dosimetry (EURADOS[4]) and the medical use of ionising radiation. EU funding will specifically be devoted to supporting the further integration, at EU level, of radiation protection research, with due attention to the interaction and synergies to be established between the various areas of expertise, in particular biology, biophysics, epidemiology, dosimetry and modelling. These disciplines are pivotal for research on medical exposures and the optimisation of the use of, and protection from ionising radiation in this field. Attention should also be paid to the development of advanced knowledge on the biology and bio-kinetics of medical radioisotopes and to the understanding of the effects of naturally occurring radiation (and the optimisation of the protection thereof), which also contribute to radiation protection basic science. This activity will also address the improvement of knowledge on the effects of ionising radiation on living beings (radioecology) both during the normal operation of nuclear installations and after an accident, which would be needed to further develop mutually compatible European tools and innovative approaches on nuclear emergency management and environmental remediation. Due attention will be paid to research and innovation necessary for supporting the successful transposition and implementation of the revised European Basic Safety Standards[5], which will require changes in national regulations and practices that should be done in a co-ordinated manner in order to optimise protection and avoid duplication. Euratom funding should benefit all European institutes involved in the research on radiation protection related issues. Finally, this activity will also aim at accelerating and improving the developing of competences in radiation protection with a special focus on radiation protection culture and at addressing the challenge of communicating results in radiation protection to non-specialist audiences such as policy decision makers and the public at large. Considerations such as gender and age are of relevance in this field of activity and will have to be addressed, notably as part of research on individual sensitivity to radiation. Moreover, gender and age balance in the composition of project teams should be sought. International cooperation could be beneficial in this area.
Expected Impact:This action will lead to the better integrating of the radiation protection scientific community at EU level, leading to a better coordination of research efforts and the provision of more consolidated and robust science-based policy recommendations to decision makers in this area. In the long term, these efforts will translate into additional or improved practical measures in view of the effective protection of people and the environment.
Type of action: Programme Co-fund Action (European Joint Programme).. Financial support to third parties may be one of the main objectives of the action. General details on the form of funding are provided in Annex 1.D.
Evaluation Criteria: The standard evaluation criteria for a European Joint Programme (Programme co-fund action) apply. For the details see Annex 1.D and 1.G

Specific challenge: The Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP) has been recognised as a European Technology Platform (ETP) by the European Commission in the context of the upcoming ""Strategy for European Technology Platforms: ETP 2020"". SNETP rests on three main pillars: (i) the NUGENIA association addressing the safety of existing light-water reactors; (ii) ESNII (European Sustainable Nuclear Industrial Initiative) dealing with the safety of fast reactors with associated strategies of spent nuclear fuel management and waste minimization, and (iii) nuclear safety of plants not restricted to electricity production. The major challenge of SNETP is to continue to integrate the R&I in nuclear safety at European Level in the global context taking due account of the various stakeholders' concerns
Scope: The Euratom funding will be devoted to specific studies, data collection and analysis activities and workshops for the further development of technology roadmaps, implementation plans and deployment strategies as well as to the dissemination of the platform activities to the various stakeholders. Due attention is to be paid in this regard to the recent SET Plan initiatives for integrating the different energy roadmaps (nuclear and non-nuclear). Activities should aim at fostering collaboration between ETPs to address cross-sectorial challenges between fission, fusion and non-nuclear energy sources as put forward at SET Plan level, notably on materials and education and training. Euratom will not cover secretariat and other running costs of the platform as it should be self-financed for these needs.
Expected impact: This action will help SNETP to further structure – content-wise - its activities. It will also help better situating the development of nuclear energy in the broader context of the relevant Horizon 2020 societal challenges, and hence help disseminating the platform's activities to the policy-makers and stakeholders.
Type of action: Coordination and Support Actions.
 Additional information: In line with the nature of the action, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom of between EUR 0,4 and 0,6 million would allow this specific support action to be undertaken appropriately.

As the fusion programme progresses towards the ultimate goal of electricity generation, there are increasing opportunities for synergies in a wide range of areas that are common with fission. The present action is to encourage closer integration of research efforts between fission and fusion research communities in the domain of multi-scale modelling in research on material properties and the development of new materials.
Scope:
Ferritic-martensitic (F/M) steel is a promising material for use in both fusion and fission installations. Multi-scale modelling is expected to be an efficient and effective tool in the development of a complete description and in-depth understanding of phenomena in these steels. In this context, the predictive capability of models is of paramount importance and should be aimed at supporting the elaboration of design rules. Proposed modelling approaches would need to be supported by robust validation means, including where necessary testing of environmental degradation and appropriate irradiation campaigns ranging from neutrons to ions. Contributions to benchmarking, the development of codes and standards as well as to small specimen test technology is also encouraged. It is essential for proposals to demonstrate substantial benefit for both fission and fusion, to include actors from both communities (specifically EUROfusion and EERA Joint Programme on Nuclear Materials), and to complement the existing research efforts in both domains.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for topics NFRP 13 and 14 will be ranked in a single ranking list.
Expected Impact:
This action will help the cross-fertilisation in nuclear materials research between the two main fields of activity represented by fission and fusion and will result in a better general understanding and critical mass in the discipline as a whole. In turn, it will help overcome bottlenecks that are limiting developments in fission and fusion, including in technology areas with safety relevance.

Scope:Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of  Nuclear Fission Safety and Radiation Protection (Euratom). The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to this field as well as to gender dimension of Research and Innovation, and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to Nuclear fission and radiation protection, and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Science with and for Society’.
Only NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and  the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.

","Research and Innovation action
","11 May 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Tritium in the environment and its health impacts are a concern. Indeed, whilst discharges of most radionuclides from fission installations are decreasing, as a result of the use of new techniques of effluent decontamination, tritium discharges are increasing owing to new nuclear fuel management modes and the lack of detritiation capability. Discharges are also anticipated from fusion installations once they start operating as nuclear facilities. Further research is needed to assess and mitigate impacts of discharges and potentially to limit them.
Scope:
This action should assess technologies to minimise tritium permeation at source and to capture and store tritium from treatment of metallic waste and liquid and gaseous effluents, e.g. using photo-synthesised polymers. This action should also include (i) an assessment of the tritium inventory in both fission and fusion systems using state-of-the-art modelling tools for tritium migration studies, e.g. from primary to secondary systems between which tritium may pass, (ii) refinement of the knowledge on outgassing and release mechanisms, radiotoxicity, radioecology, radiobiology, dosimetry and metrology of tritium, (iii) engineering solutions for detritiation techniques (metals, liquids and gasses) and waste management to meet the stringent regulations in force in the EU, and (iv) tritium permeation control (anti-permeation techniques). It is essential for proposals to demonstrate substantial benefit for both fission and fusion, to include actors from both communities, and to complement the existing research efforts in both domains. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation will be considered during the evaluation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for topics NFRP 13 and 14 will be ranked in a single ranking list.
Expected Impact:
This action will contribute to the solution of a number of key issues in the management of tritium in fission and fusion facilities that will satisfy regulatory requirements and thus minimise environmental and possible subsequent health effects. It will pave the way for robust science-based policy recommendations to decision makers in this area at EU level.

Specific challenge: Maintaining competence in fission safety remains of interest for a number of Member States especially in the Baltic and Eastern European region. Discussions have started at these various regional levels with the aim to develop jointly sustainable applications of fission for e.g. new and safer research reactor technology, radioactive waste management and training and education in these fields.
Scope: The aim is to support the exchange of scientific staff and the sharing of equipment, knowledge and competences between private and/or public research laboratories within the region and with similar organisations in other EU Member States. This action should take advantage of and develop synergies with on-going and future Euratom projects in particular those offering access to research infrastructures in conjunction with education and training. A strong involvement of appropriate public bodies from the Member States concerned is essential, as well as links with relevant platforms such as SNETP and IGD-TP. This action should also aim at examining how Structural Funds could possibly be mobilised to further develop regional cooperation in the area.

Decommissioning is currently recognised as a fixed part of nuclear facilities lifecycle which cannot be neglected when developing a roadmap to a sustainable energy future. This also reflects the public interest, as well as the contemporary principle of environmental sustainability related to any industrial activity. Though various dismantling techniques are at the level of industrial maturity, there are still specific challenges regarding achievement of high safety level, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of dismantling operations. Public research has a potential role to play in supporting safety of decommissioning and in reducing environmental impact of decommissioning. To this end, the research should provide solutions for dismantling and decontamination processes and techniques and the standardisation of processes (e.g. waste characterisation, material clearance, site release, disposal of any arising waste, etc.).
Scope:
The aim of the action is to support decommissioning stakeholders in preparing a roadmap/strategy for decommissioning research in the near future. In particular, the action would include: identification of R&I needs and possible funding schemes; identification of innovative techniques and methods; standardised measures and indicators applied to estimated and actual decommissioning costs; sharing of cost information and benchmarking; knowledge management and exchange of best practices; specific workforce planning for dismantling, decommissioning and environmental remediation; harmonisation of safety standards; education and training, etc. All activities to be performed under this action should aim at safety improvement, cost reduction and environmental impact minimisation of dismantling and decommissioning.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme of between EUR 1.1 and up to a maximum of EUR 1.4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A roadmap for decommissioning research will provide guidance to stakeholders and the Commission on the steps needed during the next 10-15 years for the development of knowledge on decommissioning and its safety, economic and environmental aspects. It should support future coordination of R&I efforts, which currently tends to be sporadic and overlapping."

","15 May 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, the challenges in the field of radioactive waste management (RWM) include:
to increase knowledge for the safe start of operation of the world's first geological disposal facilities for high-level and long-lived radioactive waste / spent nuclear fuel in the advanced Member States within the next decade while also advancing all Member States national programmes as rapidly as possible in line with requirements under Directive 2011/70/Euratom and Commission report COM(2017) 236 final[1];
to improve, innovate and develop science and technology for the management and disposal of other radioactive waste categories; and to manage and transfer knowledge and competences between generations and across Member States' national programmes.
Scope:
In view of the shared goals and clear scope for synergies in this field, the aim is to establish and implement a European Joint Programme (EJP) in the safe management and disposal of radioactive waste, bringing together a broad range of involved parties with scientific and technical responsibilities and a national mandate for research in RWM, and that are willing to pool resources in order to improve critical mass, efficiency and effectiveness in the implementing of solutions across Europe. ""Mandated actors""[2], which are nationally mandated for financing and implementing RD&D on radioactive waste management and disposal, shall be eligible for participation, as well as radioactive waste producers. The proposed EJP should follow on from the development work carried out as part of the Euratom JOPRAD project with extensive consultation of the Member States national programmes and the research community. The EJP will be co-funded via the Euratom Programme, with reimbursement based on the total declared eligible costs of the partners. The EJP should be goal-oriented, with clear and agreed high-level milestones in order to enable easy monitoring of progress. The scope of the EJP should include all the scientific and technical areas and all the horizontal activities related to knowledge management covered in the SRA (Strategic Research Agenda) elaborated by JOPRAD. The SRA should enable joint research activities on the domains of management (pre-disposal) and disposal of radioactive waste (RW) defined in Directive 2011/70/Euratom. The SRA should be translated into a deployment strategy, or roadmap, with clear objectives, deliverables and high-level milestones for technical solutions per waste streams and waste types and on knowledge management. The roadmap may extend beyond the duration of the EJP, or the duration of support from the Euratom Programme. A clearly defined roadmap and project-oriented approach to its implementation during the period of the EJP is expected to lead to the breakdown of the scientific and technical activities into work packages with specific projects, to which all involved parties (EJP partners) with the appropriate competences can participate. Projects should cover areas of interest for the small and large, advanced and less-advanced waste management programmes and should allow later inclusion of new partners. The projects should be defined by technical scope and should not be reserved for just one type of participant. An appropriate internal governance should be established through a consortium agreement, and include a 'programme office', to which staff from the partners can be seconded on a full-time basis. The 'programme office' will have a strategic role in ensuring implementation of the EJP as well as managing day-to-day activities. An appropriate means of allocation of project tasks and funding amongst the partners will need to be established on a yearly basis and take into account emerging Science and Technology (S/T) as well as Euratom research priorities. This action aims at the establishment of the European Joint Programme and open calls for proposals for third party grants are not necessary. The EJP should cover all related activities: common research and strategic studies, sharing of facilities, knowledge management, mobility and training of researchers. The involvement of external stakeholder groups should be designed into the governance mechanism, e.g. to enable Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to advise and comment on activities. To maximise knowledge management and especially the impact on the smaller and less advanced national programmes, horizontal activities should be prioritised, including i) the development of State-of-the-art documentation (e.g. text books), guidance documents for planning and implementing research, ii) training courses organised, as appropriate, with European forums and activities on education and international organisations, and iii) hands-on-training via mobility measures. In addition, the EJP should be open to international R&D cooperation and the EJP managers would be expected to represent the EJP in areas of competence in international events and forums.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme of between EUR 26 and a maximum of EUR 32.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In line with the objectives of Directive 2011/70/Euratom, this action should lead, within the next decade and across Europe, to the safe start of operation of the world's first geological disposal facilities for high-level and long-lived radioactive waste / spent nuclear fuel as well as improvement, innovation and development of science and technology for the management and disposal of other radioactive waste categories, in particular, radioactive waste streams for which industrially mature processes currently do not exist. Implementation of the action should result in greater cross-fertilisation and interaction between national programmes in key areas of general interest, improved knowledge management and transfer between actors. More particularly, EJP is a unique opportunity for less advanced programmes to benefit from integration process in the area of radioactive waste management.

Euratom legislation requires education and training to be available in order to maintain nuclear competences, especially for the staff responsible for nuclear safety, so as to obtain, maintain and broaden expertise and skills. A key concern of policy makers, regulators and industry in the EU is that availability of trained staff could be at risk, especially as a result of the expected high level of retirement and lack of interest among young generation. At the same time, due to high costs, the high quality research and training facilities are spread parsimoniously among countries and unevenly distributed. In this context, a scheme offering access to research and training infrastructures is essential to ensure adequate supply of suitable personnel for many nuclear domain disciplines and for the strengthening of the nuclear safety culture.
Scope:
The aim is to develop a scheme for supporting access to equipment and facilities of EU nuclear research laboratories for graduate and post graduate students, researchers and technicians. A key role of nuclear research infrastructures operators is required in this action. Links with different Euratom fission science and technology platforms and networks could be also beneficial and should be used to avoid duplication. Furthermore, international cooperation with organisations such as OECD/NEA, IAEA, GIF is strongly encouraged. Proposals are required to provide quantified information on the expected number of people benefitting from the proposed scheme.

Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action is expected to contribute within the next few years to the development of multi-disciplinary nuclear competences and increased availability of suitably qualified researchers, engineers and employees in crucial fields like: nuclear safety, radiation protection, decommissioning, radioactive waste management, etc. The action is expected to provide young scientists, researchers and experts with access to high quality nuclear research and training facilities.

This action should seek close cooperation with and complement actions of CONCERT[1] and MEDIRAD[2] projects, which are already funded under the Euratom Programme strictly avoiding duplication (including projects selected through the CONCERT calls). It aims at pursuing the integrative approach of radiation protection research (of radiation biology, radiation epidemiology, radioecology, medical applications, dosimetry, low-dose risk, emergency preparedness and response, etc.) involving Member States' organisations having a regulatory mandate for research in radiation protection and the wider research community such as universities and small and medium enterprises. It should complement the actions undertaken in response to the two above mentioned projects by providing incremental knowledge on the effects of ionising radiation on living beings, dosimetry and management of radiological and nuclear emergency from the publicly available knowledge these two projects are building on. The main challenge of radiation protection of the public, patients, workers and the environment remains the prediction of risks likely to arise from low dose of radiation. Significant progress has been achieved through previous programmes in refining knowledge on these effects but results indicate the need to confirm some of the observations and delineate mechanisms to be further elucidated for the further understanding of effects on living organisms of radiation beyond the knowledge already established of gene mutation. The many peripheral effects to gene functioning need to be clarified. This action must take into account prioritisation of research in this field reflected in the strategic research agendas of the Radiation Protection Research Platforms (Multidisciplinary European Low-Dose Initiative - MELODI, European Radiation Dosimetry Group - EURADOS, European Platform on Preparedness for Nuclear and Radiological Emergency Response and Recovery - NERIS, European Radioecology Alliance - ALLIANCE, and European Alliance for Medical Radiation Protection Research - EURAMED).
Scope:
The pertinence and quality of the gap analysis will be considered during evaluation. The research to be undertaken will have to improve knowledge in the fields of radiation biology epidemiology, dosimetry, emergency preparedness, radioecology, and public engagement. Research on the human health effects of ionising radiation will have to include one or several of the exposure situations occurring in the nuclear industry, the medical sector, from past nuclear accidents, naturally occurring radioactive material whether or not technologically enhanced, and cosmic radiation. The research proposal will also have to clearly demonstrate its complementarity with ongoing research in this field and the quality of the competitive process envisaged for the allocation of tasks between its partners. It is recommended that this work should be undertaken using the working procedures established by the above-mentioned platforms. In compliance with this practice of openness, a peer review of research results to indicate results which would require further research, new research orientation or inclusion in policy recommendation has to be organised.
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and trainees supported through the action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme of between EUR 5 and up to a maximum of EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action will help consolidate progress achieved in the integration of radiation protection research. It will reinforce the responsibility of the research community in ensuring that scientific evidence is comprehensively translated into policy recommendations, beyond the classical exploitation of scientific publications. In 10 years it is expected that this action will strengthen the EU capability to clarify debates on the radiation risk independently from the origin of radiation, be it cosmic, telluric, natural, artificial and related to electricity generation or medical applications. The better understanding of radiation effects on humans and the environment will ensure a better application of protection principles whilst avoiding to unduly restrict benefits for citizens of the numerous applications of ionising radiation.

Euratom Research and Training Programmes have funded a large number of research projects in the last decades in the field of radiation protection. Those projects have led to significant scientific outcomes used by various stakeholders and end-users (national and European policy makers, regulators, medical institutions, etc.). Some of these research projects contributed to the safe use of industrial applications of ionising radiation and to the development of tools supporting radiation protection of the general public, workers, patients and the environment. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic assessment of the use of the results of projects for radiation protection funded by the FP6 and FP7 Euratom Research and Training Programmes.
Scope:
The aim of the action is to identify, analyse and monitor how the results achieved by research projects on radiation protection funded by the past Euratom Research and Training Programmes, are used and capitalised on by various stakeholders so that they would serve a double purpose: (a) better use of research results for policy making and (b) better use of research results for implementing the Euratom requirements for radiation protection of the public, staff and patients Based on those analyses, measures to facilitate future use and dissemination of research results should be identified and proposed under this action. Moreover, this action should analyse scientific contribution of Euratom research to the Euratom directives on safety standards and to other international regulations and recommendations, such as those formulated by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Committee on Radiological Protection and Public Health of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the International Commission on Radiological Protection, and the findings of the United Nation’s Scientific Committee on the effects of Atomic Radiation and their further use for policy making.

An intense research activity is on-going at industrial, national and European level, and needs to be pursued, on the ageing of critical components, systems and structures important to safety to provide inputs to the decision makers and assure safe Long Term Operation (LTO).
Scope:
Research actions need to be undertaken to expand knowledge on ageing phenomena of components and structures important to safety and develop predictive or/and remediating tools or operational practices to support safe Long Term Operation of the existing nuclear fleet in line with the safety objective of the Nuclear Safety Directive. They may also contribute to increased safety features in the Gen III design where possible/appropriate.

EU nuclear plants need to demonstrate compliance with evolving and stringent safety requirements. These research actions need to result in updated knowledge on severe accidents phenomena including external hazards and to provide reliable calculation results. Therefore, they should support upgrades of simulation tools and their experimental validation to improve safety features and accident management strategies for GEN II, GEN III and GEN III+ reactors. Research actions would also identify best practices, improved assessment methods and recommendations for NPP safety upgrades where relevant.
Scope:
Further safety assessments of the severe accidents scenarios including external hazards such as floods, earthquakes, fires etc.
Building improved knowledge of nuclear plant behaviour by updated probabilistic safety assessments (PSA) along those scenarios.
Improvement of tools such as safety monitors for training purposes especially in the field of human factors under accident conditions.

Most of the nuclear power plants (NPPs) in operation in Europe are in the second part of their operational life. They have been designed with the technological knowledge established 30 to 40 years ago. Some of them might continue operating for a few more decades. In addition, they need to comply with increased safety requirements as defined by the Nuclear Safety Directive. It is therefore the right moment to promote implementation of the currently available innovative technology knowledge to the benefit of the safety of the Gen II nuclear reactors in operation but also to the Gen III and future nuclear systems. Innovative fuels, new materials and manufacturing processes, passive safety systems, on-line monitoring and analysis for early detection of abnormal behaviour, non-destructive methods for detection of embrittlement, scientific data sciences, machine learning, artificial intelligence, digitalisation and other new technological possibilities from the non-nuclear industry could support modernisation, optimisation and efficient implementation of the new safety requirements of the European nuclear industry supply chain.
Scope:
Innovation actions should take advantage of the recent developments in technology to contribute to safe operation of EU NPPs within a competitive environment. They may also target increased safety levels, in line with the principle of continuous improvement, as required by the Nuclear Safety Directive, including flexible operation. ""Qualification"" of new/modern tools, components or predictive methods and processes for nuclear applications could be also addressed.
The early involvement of regulators appears necessary for fast deployment of innovative technologies. Projects submitted under this topic are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 (see General Annex F) and demonstrate European added-value.

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are considered as a reasonable option to cover future energy needs and applications like electricity generation, heat production, cogeneration, desalination. Their compact size and modularity could allow the possibility of partial or complete in-factory assembly and transport on-site. In addition, they might offer export potential and might be faster and easier to build and to operate under certain conditions. The smaller size of the reactor could lead to innovative safety features in terms of residual heat removal and size of containment structure. SMRs would be designed to cope with and minimize consequences of severe accidents. Compliance with the safety objective as established by Article 8a of the Nuclear Safety Directive may significantly vary depending on the safety options of the proposed design and the targeted application(s) and thus it needs to be further investigated. The focus should be given to support SMRs licensing process.
Scope:
The research should propose the methodologies for performing safety evaluations and safety improvements fostering safety standards, including the experimental validation of essential items for safety demonstrations. Further, this action should bring tools for assessment of specific present and future SMR technologies and provide a set of their safety specifications and requirements in line with the EU directives. Focus should be also given to set up basic safety objectives for future SMRs licensing process. Research activities proposed under this topic should strictly avoid duplication with research activities already funded by the Euratom Research and Training Programmes.

This action will allow the EU to establish a baseline for safety assessments and verification of existing and future SMR concepts during the following years. The safety demonstration could also provide support tools for SMR licensing process and to maintain highest standards in the EU's proposed concepts and designs. Therefore, it can pave the way for robust science-based recommendations to decision-makers regarding SMR safety in the EU. Moreover, it will reinforce EU’s commercial prospects and competitiveness in this field."

Advanced nuclear systems for increased sustainability and first Generation-IV reactors are expected to be fully operational around the world in coming decades. In the meantime, all new concepts and designs currently under development, both in Europe and worldwide, will need to demonstrate compliance with evolving and ever more stringent safety requirements. In this context, a significant increase in the level of safety is expected to be demonstrated. Advanced designs should show increased resilience to severe accidents , while also offering major advantages in terms of one or more of: use of uranium resource, reduction of high-level waste production and increased proliferation resistance. This activity will build on the experiences gained within the EU, whilst ensuring that research and technical expertise on nuclear safety of Generation-IV reactors, including assessment of safety features, is shared effectively at EU level. It will also take into account all relevant orientations promoted in the framework of the Generation-IV International Forum (GIF) to fulfil the commitment of Euratom.
Scope:
This action is aimed at the development and technical assessment of safety improvements of Generation-IV systems and their supporting reactor islands, as identified by the SNETP European Sustainable Nuclear Industrial Initiative and the GIF R&D outlook[1]. This can include inter alia the study, modelling and numerical simulation, verification, validation and licensing aspects of core safety parameters, thermal-hydraulics of coolants and liquid fuels, compatibility of structural materials and components with coolants or liquid fuels, reliability of automatic and passive shutdown systems, diversified residual heat removal systems, improved strategy of confinement modes, mitigation of severe accident behaviour, instrumentation for safety, in-service inspection and repair of safety-related components, as well as seismic studies. Safety of different fuel and fuel cycle options is within scope, including MOX driver fuel, multiple recycling of plutonium and use of low-enriched uranium. These safety improvements will need to be reviewed by the EU scientific community. Whenever needed, standardisation bodies at national and EU levels might be involved, in view of building up and updating EU technical code and standards for Generation-IV systems to be used as the reference to demonstrate any compliance with the Euratom Nuclear Safety Directive.
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and trainees supported through the action. (see Conditions for the Call- Eligibility and admissibility conditions).

An open fuel cycle uses only a few portion of the energy contained in uranium. This efficiency can be greatly improved through the recycling of spent fuel, including, in the longer term, multi-recycling strategies. Furthermore, such closed fuel cycles could facilitate the management of ultimate radioactive waste by reducing its volume and radiotoxicity whilst also offering major advantages in terms of the use of the uranium resource and potentially increased proliferation resistance. The EU benefits from extensive operational experience in this domain, which is unique in the world. This experience should be exploited and extended in order to further improve nuclear safety, radiation protection and environmental protection aspects of fuel reprocessing options. This challenge is also to be seen in relation to partitioning and transmutation (P&T) processes for suitable recycling strategies, development and qualification, and safety assessment of innovative fuels and claddings for advanced Generation-IV systems.
Scope:
This action will address back-end fuel cycle research and innovation needs in all technical areas of P&T as identified by the SNETP Deployment Strategy and provide the basis for further development of pilot facilities, industrial scale demonstration for the most advanced P&T systems, involving sub-critical and/or critical systems, with a view to reducing the volumes and hazard of high-level long-lived radioactive waste issuing from treatment of spent nuclear fuel. Advanced experimental tests, infrastructures, as well as numerical simulation tools will be required to conduct these interdisciplinary research activities. Full advantage should be taken from the existing European research institution networks fostering further integration, and where International Cooperation could be highly beneficial in this area.

This research will enhance any efficiency and safety of processes using state-of-the-art P&T technology towards a closure of the nuclear fuel cycle. Even if a final repository would still be needed, the P&T would drastically reduce the radiotoxicity, the heat production and package volume of high-level radioactive wastes, thereby easing the long-term safety of a final repository."

Advanced materials are the very basis of the technological development and industrial innovation. In domain of the nuclear materials, qualification of existing materials for the conditions of nuclear installations, their further improvement as well as development of new materials plays a crucial role in assuring the highest safety standards for these installations. Whether it is long-term operation of the existing NPP fleet, design of innovative nuclear systems, proper radioactive waste management, further improvement in radiation protection or other possible applications of the radioactive matter – the way forward always includes the materials science aspect.
The research effort to proceed ahead in this area is very resource-intensive and extremely costly. On the other hand, there is a limited number of the laboratories and industrial players in Europe, which can properly handle R&D of the nuclear materials. As a logical sequence of the above factors, several year ago Euratom in frame of European Energy Research Alliance (EERA)[1] instigated creation of EERA Joint Programme on Nuclear Materials (JPNM)[2]. EERA JPNM is currently involving all the major European players having more than 50 participants from 17 European countries. EERA JPNM has six subprograms, four of which deal with materials for the innovative nuclear systems and two with the development of the advanced nuclear fuels. On the other hand, EU-based NUGENIA association[3], which includes more than 100 participants worldwide and aims to be a research framework for Gen II & III fission technologies, deals, among other subjects, with the variety of the material science issues needed to assure safe, competitive and reliable exploitation of the current and upcoming nuclear reactors fleet.
In addition to nuclear materials, several European countries, whether nuclear, non-nuclear or in the nuclear phasing-out process, are supporting nuclear materials research in frame of their national research programmes. However, the research performed at EU and Member State levels is not conducted in well-concerted fashion. Further consolidation of the domain, with aim to avoid duplications and to improve complementarity, resulting eventually in the joint European programme on nuclear materials having a necessary dedicated resources and momentum, is necessary.
Scope:
This action should explore the possibility of establishing in the future a joint European programme in area of nuclear materials and nuclear fuels. Readiness of the Member States for the joint European effort has to be analysed. Complementarity of research effort for current and future innovative nuclear systems has to be assured. The Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) for nuclear materials and nuclear fuels covering short-to-medium term period, i.e. for the period up to 15-20 years, has to be one of the project’s deliverables. The SRA should take into account different scenarios of long-term operation of the current fleet of the reactors as well as possible scenarios of deploying advanced nuclear systems in Europe. Research on fission reactor materials, including cladding, core structures, pressure vessels, coolant interactions with materials, moderator and control components as well as on innovative nuclear fuels should be included in the SRA. The SRA has to include recommendations regarding standardisation within the EU of the testing procedures, their handling, approach to the relevant design codes. The availability of the respective infrastructure necessary to perform successfully the R&D activities should be analysed. Relation with fusion materials has to be clearly presented. Knowledge management plan relevant for domain, including data management plan, has to be introduced.
The identified research areas could also serve as a basis for further actions supported by other priorities of EU Horizon 2020 programme and its successor, relevant for industrial technologies, to maximise synergies and impact.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 1.1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action should help further consolidate EU Member States’ research programmes and the Euratom effort in domain of nuclear materials. Such joint approach should help to European players to remain at the forefront of the nuclear materials R&D assuring, on the one hand, highest safety standards of nuclear installations in Europe, and, on the other hand, improving competitiveness of Europe at the world scale in this dynamic technology domain.

As highlighted in the Joint Programme on Nuclear Materials (JPNM) developed by the EERA[1], materials research and innovation is at the cornerstone of many technological developments, notably in the nuclear field, where technical qualification and certification are subject to stringent safety criteria. It is therefore of paramount interest for Euratom to support research and innovation in this area, notably for resolving the key remaining issues regarding structural and fuel materials to be used in Generation-IV reactor concepts under consideration in the EU.
Scope:
Whilst the EU nuclear materials research community has significant experience and extensive knowledge of materials behaviour under conditions typical for Generation-IV reactor concepts, there are still some areas where further research and innovation is needed to reach technological maturity. This applies in particular to changes in properties of materials and joints under fast neutron irradiation and/or high temperature of the coolant, as well as to the compatibility between structural materials, the coolant and advanced fuels. This action should include the refinement of physical models and/or modelling-oriented experiments aimed at the validation of models of microstructural change and the resulting effects on material properties, as well as advanced micro-structural characterisation techniques. This research and innovation could also include the development, testing and qualification of mitigation strategies involving, for example, the development of suitable surface engineering concepts for current known material deficiencies.

The development of new biotechnology-based products needs to be complemented with a scientifically valid identification of the potential hazards from these biomaterials to human health and to the environment, together with the monitoring and reduction of the risk that these new technologies pose. Current knowledge is still incomplete and the established methods may be inappropriate for specific materials. Hence, future production system engineering requires validated methodologies as basis for an appropriate integrated risk management. As relevant, the proposed activities should address sex and gender specific aspects[1].
Projects are expected to initiate and support standardisation of the proposed biomaterials and methods, including methods that will reflect their eventual deployment as part of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and/or Medical Devices.
The expected projects should be related to validating, adapting and/or developing a reliable methodology for risk assessment and thorough overarching hazard identification for engineered biomaterials and should address the following areas:
Comparison and validation of current (and/or development including validation of new) test methods and test schemes, including in vitro and in silico methods, to detect adverse effects from biomaterials to:
human health including acute and chronic toxicity (oral, inhalation, dermal);
modelling toxicity behaviour of engineered Biomaterials, including development of ready-to-use predictive models (web services etc);
the environment; eco-toxicity tests, bioaccumulation, persistence, bioavailability and life cycle impacts onto all forms of biota.
Relevant reference and/or certified reference materials;
Management of accidental risk including explosion and massive release;
Methods for performance assessment of hazard and exposure monitoring systems and on the field detection systems;
Methods for evaluation of risk reduction strategies and systems.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 4 and target TRL 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for international cooperation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Development of comprehensive understanding of the properties, interaction and fate of engineered biomaterials in relation to human health and environment;
Support to policy and decision making concerning biomaterials research in respect to various stakeholders: public authorities, industry, researchers and citizens;
Validated test methods and schemes for the identification of potential adverse effects from biomaterials and contribution to the future definition of appropriate measures, where needed;
Support to pre and co-normative activities, such as with reference to the implementation of the REACH regulation[2];
Support to good governance in biomaterials research following the safe, integrated and responsible approach as laid down in ""Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies: An action plan for Europe"".

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research and technology development at the interface of key enabling technologies has the potential to provide novel technological Micro-Nano–Bio integrated Systems (MNBS) platforms to enhance the ability to sense, detect, analyse, monitor and act on phenomena from macro (e.g. body, organ, tissues) to nano scale (e.g. molecules, genes). These developments have a high potential for facilitating personalised and preventive healthcare. However, the translation of laboratory proven concepts to the clinical environment involving pre-clinical and clinical testing, prototyping, and small series manufacturing is currently lagging. Business development and market growth are therefore still limited. The challenge is to bring new promising laboratory proven MNBS concepts for addressing priority healthcare needs from the laboratory to the clinic.
Scope:
The focus is on further development into a clinical setting of novel MNBS platforms, techniques and systems that have already been proven in a laboratory setting (laboratory Proof-of-Concept). These must pertain to one or more of the following:
In vitro/in vivo diagnostics that are deployed at the point of care;
Therapy monitoring at the point of care.
Proposals should pay attention to facilitate clinical data harvesting, e.g. for medical regulatory purposes and/or to enhance epidemiological monitoring of health and disease patterns. As relevant, the proposed activities should address sex and gender specific aspects[1].
Proposals should demonstrate clear compliance with applicable Good Laboratory Practice /Good Clinical Practice /Good Manufacturing Practice, and be consistent with ISO and other regulations (both national and European). The translation from the pre-clinical phase to early clinical testing, including design and pilot manufacturing in appropriate volume for clinical testing (small series), pre-clinical and early clinical testing is a necessary part of the work-up. Attention should be paid to the requirements for Health Technology Assessment (HTA). Standardisation issues have to be taken into account where appropriate.
Activities are expected to commence at Technology Readiness Levels 3/4 and reach 5-6.
A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address one or more of the following impact criteria and provide metrics to measure and monitor success.
Address priority needs in healthcare diagnostics and / or therapy monitoring, for the benefit of patients;
Provide affordable systems with unique features that address specific well identified requirements in healthcare;
Progress the development of advanced integrated MNBS based diagnostic health platforms, techniques or systems from the laboratory Proof-of-Concept to the clinical setting;
Establish a world-class European competitive industrial R&D and manufacturing competence in Micro-Nano-Bio Systems integration for healthcare diagnostics applications;
Strengthening the industrial value chain and progress to marketisation;
Early involvement of regulatory bodies and patients in the new developments.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

","04 May 2017","Specific Challenge:
As material systems and device structures become nanosized and nanostructured, significant challenges exist with respect to their design and the tailoring of their functions in a controlled way. The use of discrete materials models, as a bridge for linking and coupling nanostructure features to macroscopic device functionality is gaining increasing importance in the fast and reliable development of new materials, devices, and the control of the related production processes. Characterisation techniques and experimental data for process optimisation and model validation are key in such developments.
Europe has a large number of first-class laboratories for characterisation in the field of advanced materials and nanotechnologies. In some cases, regional hubs of laboratories addressing characterisation for specific industrial or application sectors have already been successfully established. Nevertheless, there is an ever increasing need for a strong transnational and trans-sectorial coordination and optimisation of existing characterisation technologies and their utilisation for the benefit of widespread process optimisation and model validation. This includes the need for widely agreed experiment protocols, multi-technique and multi-scale characterisation approaches, metadata descriptions of interpretation tools and accessible, relevant, and reliable data bases for raw and interpreted data.
Scope:
In the triangle of manufacturing, modelling, and experimentation, the projects should develop an open innovation environment for the optimisation of materials, materials behaviour and/or nano-device manufacturing processes, and for the validation of materials models[1] based on experimental characterisation.
An open innovation environment should be created linking characterisation laboratories with capacities adapted to process optimisation and model validation needs. Also information on characterisation tools and expertise should be included.
Commonly agreed validation and measurement protocols should be developed which address the most relevant issues related to experiments, process optimisation and model validation. Projects should also document their protocols for the interpretation of raw experimental data and document reliable models for data interpretation where needed. The project may seek to agree standards for interpretation protocols. Meta data to describe all protocols should be agreed.
The same metadata should be used for interfacing existing characterisation databases to make search and linking between different, distributed databases effective and easy. The metadata should allow future extension to other sectors. Strategies and test rules pertaining to data integrity and quality mechanisms should be established. A concept to make raw and interpreted data citable should be developed and implemented for this system. The project should ensure wide spread participation.
Projects should bring together a representative number of players from public and industrial nanoscale characterisation laboratories, from manufacturers, and from the academic and industrial materials modelling communities. To ensure a wide coverage, these players should cover several industrial or application sectors. Existing regional/national hubs may also participate, but they need to connect in the project to players in other countries, possibly also other regional/national hubs.
The proposal should present a credible business plan for the maintenance of the open environment after the project duration.
Proposers are strongly encouraged to consult the stakeholders outside the consortium through existing groups such as the European Materials Modelling Council or the Characterisation cluster. Appropriate resources should be foreseen for clustering activities.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 4 and target TRL 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
International standardisation, e.g. with the ISO, may be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased speed of material and/or nano-device development through development of an open innovation environment;
Wide acceptance of the proposed solutions beyond the consortium;
Use of the protocols and systems in other relevant areas or sectors beyond the ones covered by the project;
Use of the protocols in the development of new standards;
Clear, prospects for quantified, socio-economic gains from the proposed solutions should be addressed, supported by quantifications;
The maintenance aspect of the developed databases beyond the lifetime of the project should be addressed.

","04 May 2017","Specific Challenge:
Creative industries have been defined as one of the most active, significant and relevant new emerging industrial sectors in the European economy (Report on Emergency Industries, PwC, 2012). The creative industries linked to manufacturing (e.g. architecture, automotive, art, crafts, supports for cultural items, decoration, fashion, furniture, lighting, interior design materials and products, jewels, luxury, media supports, publishing, sport and toys) are generators of competitive advantages that cannot be reproduced elsewhere, promoters of local development and drivers of industrial change (COM(2012)537 ‘Promoting cultural and creative sectors for growth and jobs in the EU’).
Creative SMEs in particular can make use of design as a strategic tool to create innovative products and services addressing new consumers' standards and societal challenges while assuring competitive and sustainable development.
However, the future European exploitation of this rich sector depend on the EU ability to support high-growth creative SMEs and start-ups in exploiting highly innovative technological advances in materials for commercial, cultural and societal applications.
To promote design-driven innovation, a number of action lines have been endorsed by the Commission, including integrating design into research and development and promoting new collaborative innovation strategies (‘Implementing an Action Plan for Design-Driven Innovation’, SWD(2013)380).
Scope:
Proposals should address the development of innovative advanced material solutions (e.g. superhydrophobic/superoleophobic nanomaterials and nanoscale systems, self-cleaning and self-healing systems, smart textile fabrics and papers, biomimetic, shape change/memory materials, self-assembling systems, energy harvesters) for use in the creative industry sectors defined above to make urban living significantly easier, more sustainable, more comfortable, more secure and more functional. Creativity, cultural and societal values, alongside specialist knowledge, should be driving the material innovation (e.g. increased performance, lightness, safety, sustainability, improved lifetime) to add value to products through the use of new intangible material functionalities (e.g. creative design, artistic expression, trend translation, enhanced sensations, cultural values).
Proof of concept in terms of product and/or process must be delivered within the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes (in compliance with European Commission Communication 2006/C323/01), but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs.
In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the research efforts, the key properties improvement and commercial potential of the innovative technologies compared to state-of-the-art solutions currently available on the market should be convincingly assessed in the proposal. Sustainability aspects in the whole life cycle of the final products should be taken into account. The active participation of designers, artists, societal stakeholders, material scientists, materials suppliers, researchers, manufacturers and end users of the resulting products represents an added value and this will be reflected in the second stage of the evaluation. As relevant, the proposed activities should address sex and gender specific aspects[1].
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6, and target Technology Readiness Level 7.
A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Novel, higher added-value, better performing, sustainable, versatile, appealing designs and creative solutions for consumer goods based on innovative advanced materials or structures;
Good integrability of the proposed innovative materials in final products (e.g. using a modular approach) and quickly reconfigurable to new custom requirements;
Promoting new collaborative innovation strategies and practices along the value chain to develop commercial, cultural and societal applications with a strong user orientation, creating new business opportunities for the European industry and contributing to the circular economy in terms of one or more of the following: increased competiveness, faster recovery of investment, access to new markets, access to new customer segments, increased business effectiveness, increased costumer engagement, increased environmental sustainability;
Enhancing innovation capability and competiveness of European SMEs by effectively combining and transferring new and existing knowledge with ‘intangible’ factors (e.g. creative design, artistic expression, trend translation, enhanced sensations, cultural values);
Increasing awareness of designers about new materials;

","04 May 2017","Specific Challenge:
Durability is a key criterion for materials in many applications and environments. Longer performing materials can strongly reduce overall life time costs, such as lower usage costs through reduced maintenance and shorter service interruptions. Costs may also be reduced in the production phase (raw materials, energy, transport, formability), in the installation phase, and the materials may be more appropriate for end of life reuse/recycling. Typical applications requiring excellent long term durability and high reliability are buildings, marine applications and infrastructures including off shore.
In many applications, operational durability needs to be better understood, particularly for innovative products which have no demonstrated long term performance. Durability has to be evaluated both theoretically and in real installation conditions (including within challenging environments when relevant) as these may influence final product performance.
Scope:
Research proposals should address all of the following activities: theoretical understanding (and development of models if appropriate) of the factors which affect durability of materials, including corrosion and ageing phenomena; experimental methods to measure and reliably test durability, non-destructive inspection procedures and monitoring tools; development of new and more durable materials (possibly multifunctional); and “fit for purpose” validation of new materials through life testing in the planned application and environment.
The proposed solutions should go well beyond the state of the art and it should be demonstrated that materials with improved durability also fulfil all other properties necessary for the application proposed.
The following factors should also be all considered: principles of sustainability (the sustainability of each developed solution should be evaluated via life cycle assessment studies carried out according to the International Reference Life Cycle Data System - ILCD Handbook); ease of installation; realistic solutions at a reasonable price and appropriateness for the operational environment; resistance to harsh environments if applicable. When relevant, design considerations (optimal combination of new materials) should also be considered. Recycling/reuse of materials should also be addressed. Standardisation aspects should be considered when relevant. Proof of concept in terms of one (or more) component(s) containing the new materials developed should be delivered within the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes (2006/C323/01), but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs. Information guides for applications, installation and any appropriate training on the new solutions should be provided before the end of the project.

At least 30% improvement in durability on the most relevant properties for the application;
At least equivalent level for all other properties;
At least 30% lower cost;
Positive LCA balance over the whole life cycle;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
One of the principal levers to improve the energy efficiency, performance and range of vehicles, and reduce their impact on the environment, is to decrease their weight. This is particularly important for conventionally-powered vehicles to reduce CO2 emissions but also for EVs in which the relatively limited range and high costs, linked to the still comparatively low production volumes, remain critical factors that determine their competitiveness.
Previously-conducted EU research projects have already demonstrated the fact that the adoption of advanced grades of steel, metal alloys, aluminium, novel plastics and biomaterials, novel high-strength light-weight ceramics and composites can lead to a drastic reduction in the weight of a wide range of vehicle components. However the outcome of these activities is also that the additional cost for each kilogram saved is still too high to represent a revolutionary approach enabling intensive use of such lightweight materials particularly in vehicles intended for mass-production.
Correspondingly it is necessary to address this issue directly and urgently in order to identify solutions for the significant weight reduction of vehicles, and in particular electrified cars, which are cost-effective and viable with respect to the intended production volumes and from the entire life-cycle perspective, improving performance without compromising crashworthiness and durability. Specifically the principal focus should be on large production volumes exploiting economies of scale, targeting production volumes of at least 50000 units per annum, while investigating also the opportunity for developing common solutions across different types of vehicle.
Scope:
The principal focus should be on large production volumes exploiting economies of scale, targeting production volumes of at least 50000 units per annum, while investigating also the opportunity for developing common solutions across different types of vehicle.
A holistic, integrated and cost-driven approach should be pursued in order to optimize the use of lightweight materials solutions in all vehicle structures, subsystems and components (with the exception of concepts for stand-alone powertrains), considering the entire value chain from a life-cycle perspective: materials, tools, process, assembly and end-of-life.
Materials engineering should address the development of new low density/high strength and highly formable materials (e.g. steels, alloys, aluminium, castings, polymers, biomaterials, ceramics and reinforcements) and their combination (e.g. composites, sandwiches, high strength foams) at affordable prices starting from less expensive sources, also via recycling and/or processes which are less energy-demanding. Furthermore, materials engineering should address corrosion, thermal expansion, joining (e.g. bonding, riveting, friction-stir based technologies, etc.) and recycling issues of multi-material designs, one essential prerequisite being the widespread availability and minimal CO2 footprint of the candidate materials.
Manufacturing engineering should address both the need to use less energy-intensive and more sustainable technologies, and the opportunity to speed-up and improve the efficiency of lightweight part production also through the combination of different manufacture steps, moving towards new approaches specific for new materials, including cost-effective multi-material joining technologies as well as the formability of tailored blanks material hybrid parts, and considering also effective multi-material surface treatments.
Design should pursue approaches based on both “right material for the right application” and “multi-functional optimization” in order to exploit the lightweight materials properties, optimizing their use through functional integration of multi-material solutions, including design for recycling. In view to further reduce the environmental footprint of the vehicles, the use of recycled high added-value materials should be considered.
Virtual engineering should support the multi-functional design for the optimization of performance (including crashworthiness, durability, etc.), developing and applying methods and tools to enable the efficient and effective simulation of multi-functional, multi-material solutions as well as of sustainable manufacturing technologies in order to minimize material use and energy consumption. Importantly Life Cycle Analysis (LCA should support the entire design and development process.
The activities are required to identify solutions for the weight reduction of vehicles, including, but not limited to, electrified cars which, through a comprehensive analysis, should be demonstrated to be both viable, in terms of cost and production, and sustainable from the life-cycle perspective.
The solutions must be validated at the application level, with full verification of the virtual engineering approach, to demonstrate improved performance without any compromise in terms of crashworthiness and durability. An assessment of the applicability of the solutions developed across different vehicle types is also expected.
This topic is a NMBP contribution to the European Green Vehicles Initiative (EGVI) and was developed in close collaboration with EGVI. It complements the EGVI activities in the Work Programme part of the Societal Challenge “Smart, green and integrated transport”.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 4 and target TRL 6.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Specific targets that should be achieved in short- to medium-term (within a time frame of about 6 years following the completion of the project) include:
10 % reduction in energy consumption of vehicle due to weight reduction (with corresponding impact in terms of CO2 emissions depending on the vehicle type);
Cost-effective weight savings depending on intended production volumes, eg.:
For 50000 units per annum: at least 6 €/kg-saved;
For 100000+ units per annum: at least 3 €/kg-saved;
At least 6% improvement in LCA environmental impact (""from cradle to grave"") in terms of GWP (Global Warming Potential).

At least one type of tissue engineering construct should be delivered at the end of the research project together with a proof of concept of its therapeutic potential and preclinical validation.
In order to ensure relevance and impacts of the research efforts, the active participation of industrial partners and clinicians represents an added value to the proposals and this will be reflected in the evaluation under the criterion “Impact”. A multidisciplinary approach is preferred; taking into account both surgical, minimally invasive and pharmacological approaches, as well as prevention and rehabilitation strategies, including robotics if necessary. The expected results should improve the quality of life of the affected population and their careers. They should be measurable even for optimising research costs of the enterprises and for reducing time-to-market of new products. The project should include training and dissemination activities. As relevant, the proposed activities should address sex and gender specific aspects[5].
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 3 and target TRL 5.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Innovative bio/nano-materials for the treatment of patients with demyelination disorders of the Central Nervous System, improving their quality of life due to minimally invasive action and/or longer duration of implants and devices;
reduced direct and indirect costs linked to these diseases and their treatment;
enhance competitiveness of the biomaterials and biomedical industries in the EU, in particular through technology transfer effects on biotechnology companies, with particular regard to SMEs and new forms of cooperation between academia, research centres and the private sectors. Such effects should be balanced to match sustainability principles and values, and to enforce competitiveness in terms of reducing time-to-market and trial costs for European industries;
Dissemination of results, contributing to increase social awareness about more efficient and less costly therapies – based upon innovative approaches and broader accessibility – with improved patient compliance.
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.

","24 May 2016","Specific Challenge:
Many biomolecules (e.g. proteins, peptides, nucleic acid, enzymes), in opposition to classical small molecules, have demonstrated interesting therapeutic activities in vitro. However, they are too often not druggable because once in pre-clinical in vivo development, they show disappointing loss of efficacy and/or unacceptable toxicity. For example, a high in vitro efficacy of a therapeutic biomolecule can disappointedly become low in vivo, because the biomolecule is processed by the immune system or by enzymes of the host before reaching its targeted tissue. Nanotechnology represents a promising opportunity to overcome these drawbacks. Indeed, the formulation of nanocarriers containing biomolecules ('biologicals') for drug/vaccine delivery can greatly improve their in vivo efficacy and/or decrease their toxicity and provide the capability to cross biological barriers (e.g. intestinal, blood-brain barrier, nasal, ocular, pulmonary, skin).
Scope:
This call addresses nanoformulation of biologicals (like proteins, peptides, nucleic acids and enzymes). With an appropriate formulation the biologicals can be effectively transported through the relevant biological barriers to the targeted organs, tissues and cells.
Formulation of nanomedicines has in general been empirical and often produced in an amorphous or undefined structure, which produces regulatory and manufacturing control issues. The aim of the research is to achieve excellent quality control of the assembly by using self-assembling systems. The resulting processes should provide a high degree of control over the physico-chemical parameters like shape, size and chemical composition while incorporating non-Lipinski molecules such as nucleics acids, proteins or peptides. Characterisation aspects of the nanoformulations therefore have to be properly addressed. The benefit will be easier manufacturing and process control, as well as optimised nanoformulation of biologicals with tailored transport through biological barriers.
Projects will develop a nanoformulation of biomolecules to provide a solid pre-clinical proof of concept, address scale-up to the quantities needed for late pre-clinical and clinical study and prepare for future clinical testing. Partners will also have to describe how the various barriers for advancing their new therapy to clinical application will be overcome; they will especially take into account the medical regulatory requirements and the scale-up production for clinical study. As relevant, the proposed activities should address sex and gender specific aspects[1].
The clinical focus should be notably on age related diseases, neglected diseases and rare diseases or inflammatory diseases, but excluding cancer and infectious diseases.
Activities are expected to commence at Technology Readiness Levels 3 /4 and reach 5/6.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Developments of new solutions for the particularly needed delivery of biologicals;
Radical improvement of therapy through the development of new nanoformulation solutions for the delivery of biologicals;
Foster the translation of nanoformulation of biomolecules towards clinical development / application;
Improvement of the competitiveness of the European healthcare industry through accelerated introduction of new nanotechnology enabled therapies;
Improved understanding by academics and research organisations of the requirements of the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry and of medical regulators.

The increasing availability of novel biomaterials with tissue regeneration properties[1] offers the solution for many diseases, including those of a degenerative nature, particularly as integral parts of advanced therapy medicinal products or medical devices. These disorders are often poorly amenable to current healthcare interventions. The design of new biomaterials capable of inducing tissue specific regeneration, which can derive from many different pathological processes or tissue defects, as elements of these medical technologies, results from their increasing fusion/combination. The production of these technologies is highly warranted. EU intervention in this field is required to achieve this goal and thereby develop new and innovative affordable technologies delivering personalised services.
Scope:
Research activities on functional biomaterials for regenerative medicine should show their advanced properties and their eventual field of application. These may include association with pluripotent stem cells, biostimulators, microfluidic devices, cellularised and/or biomimetic scaffolds, biological agents and appropriate disease models etc.
Proposals should cover one of the following domains:
Targeted musculoskeletal delivery of cells or biologically active agents and innovative biomaterials for articular cartilage/disc, ligament and tendon repair in weight-bearing joints;
Stimulation of healing in chronic and infected wounds and ulcerative processes (with or without biofilms as necessary);
Preventing microbial infection and concurrently promoting tissue regeneration in dental implants and/or dental root surgery;
Implementation of innovative manufacturing technologies (e.g. 3D printing) for affordable fabrication of patient-specific scaffolds planned in respect of the foregoing.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key element in the EU low-carbon policy. Presently, the roll-out has been hampered by costs and techno-economic uncertainties of the CCS, where CO2 capture is a major part. While there is a need to demonstrate currently state-of-the-art capture technologies in real market conditions, promising new material solutions have been under development for the next generation CCS technologies that are expected to reach the markets beyond 2020. These solutions could dramatically improve the efficiency of CO2 capture but the materials manufacturing processes should be further developed towards higher yields while conserving functionality at a lower cost.
Scope:
Proposals should capitalise on promising material solutions for the next generation CO2 capture technologies (such as pre-combustion or post-combustion capture, oxygen combustion or other novel technologies or concepts). Recent work on such materials and capture techniques, based on, inter alia, nanostructured hybrid materials, membranes, solid and liquid-based adsorbents has made progress to the extent that their cost and performance competitiveness with respect to the state-of-the-art technologies (at least at demonstration level) should now be tested. The proposed solutions need to prove their added value in terms of sustainability and performance or their ability to address unique applications, and their viability in terms of manufacturability, yield, stability, long working-life and easy regeneration. Finally, the high efficiency concepts should be assessed for technical and economic viability and developed to readiness for pilot manufacturing to integrate the high-performance materials in existing demonstration projects.
This topic calls for proposals with focus on the manufacturability high performance materials for CO2 capture. A partially complementary topic is published in the “Secure, clean and efficient energy” part of this Work Programme (LCE 24-2016: International Cooperation with South Korea on new generation high-efficiency capture processes), calling for proposals on the development of high potential novel technologies or processes for post- and/or precombustion CO2 capture.

Energy storage will play a key role in enabling the EU to develop a low-carbon electricity system. Energy storage can supply more flexibility and balancing to the grid, providing a back up to intermittent renewable energy. Chemical energy storage is the transformation of electrical energy into chemical energy carriers. It consequently involves exchange of energy between different vectors of the energy system. Once the energy is transformed to chemicals the concept opens for many ways to use the primary electric energy, e.g., for re-electrification, heating and mobility. For such chemical energy storage, hydrogen or chemicals are considered. In particular the production of chemicals (e.g. methanol, ethanol, methane and syngas amongst others) by co-electrolysis is very promising technology in which R&I efforts should result in a substantial increase of the efficiency of the processes.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on the development of advanced materials, materials solutions or new chemistries, to up-scale the chemical storage of energy in chemicals or hydrogen to economically viable levels. The proposals should select one or more of the following subjects:
The development of low cost advanced materials for solid state storage of hydrogen at low pressure, targeting at the same time improved storage density and cycling durability;
The development of direct synthesis of chemicals from CO2-H2O co-electrolysis using materials and reactors made of sustainable, non-toxic and non-critical raw materials2;
The development of efficient low cost photochemical water splitting reactors with optimized flow behaviour, as well as new catalysts with longer lifetimes;
The optimization of low-cost electro-chemistries to separate and purify hydrocarbon streams.
The technical validation in an industrially relevant environment and economic viability of the proposed solutions should be addressed in the proposal.
This topic calls for proposals with focus on cost effective materials solutions for “power-to-chemical"" technologies. A complementary topic with focus on using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) to convert renewable electricity into hydrogen and, via hydrogen, into other products is included in the 2015 Work Plan of the FCH Joint Undertaking (JU).

Scope:
The proposed ERA-NET aims to coordinate the research and innovation efforts of the participating Member States, Associated States and Regions in the field of advanced manufacturing, continuing the activities started by MANUNET and followed by MANUNET II, supporting in particular SMEs and with a special focus on the key areas of new production processes, adaptive manufacturing systems and technologies for the factory of the future, and to implement a joint transnational call for proposals (resulting in grants to third parties) with EU co-funding to support multi-national innovative research initiatives in this domain.
Coordination with the relevant players at European level such as those in the Factories of the Future cPPP and relevant European Technology Platforms is expected and the strong involvement in the transnational projects of SMEs with innovation potential is encouraged.
International cooperation on R&I issues on manufacturing at global level should be properly addressed and the potential participation in the proposed ERA-NET of regions from third countries with local funding programmes on manufacturing is encouraged.

Investment in integrating energy storage refurbishing the grid is essential for keeping pace with the increasing demands for electricity arising from continued growth in productivity and the projected increase in distributed and/or intermittent energy sources. The technical aspects that will be posed by an improved grid include inventing new technologies requiring new advanced materials. Some materials will improve the current technology, while some will enable emerging technologies.

","04 May 2017","Specific Challenge:
Risk assessment is often largely based on the toxicological profile of the material in question. The reason is that the costs related to hazard assessment are usually not in balance with the costs for exposure monitoring, let alone risk containment or risk mitigation. However with the very big number of new material likely to enter production and use, the usually short period between development and marketing and the increase in societal risk aversion, the classical toxicological testing paradigm so far focusing on in vivo testing is gradually but steadily shifting towards in-vitro and in-silico testing approaches. This is particularly true in the field of nanosafety where, in front of potentially thousands of different nanomaterials, economic constraints make it essential to develop and establish robust, fast and yet reliable and realistic methods that should be applied in figuring out ""nanomaterials of concern"".
Significant progresses have been made in assessing nanomaterial hazard. Yet, knowledge gaps remain on long-term effects (low doses, chronic exposure), both for human health and the environment. Questions also arise on the adequacy of the models used in existing in-vitro and in-silico testing and on the relevance of the exposure conditions (e.g. linked to the current understanding of the nanomaterial-biomolecule-cell interface) to correctly assess and predict real-life hazards. It is also necessary to prepare the ground for the next challenge, defining hazard profiles based on in-silico testing alone.
Scope:
With a view to intelligent testing strategies (ITS) for nanomaterials, it is of high priority to develop and adopt realistic and advanced in vitro tests which have the potential to substantially improve the relevance of in-vitro approaches. Current in-vitro experiments mostly rely on established immortalized single cell lines, which often do not reflect the in-vivo situation. Therefore, new or advanced models, such as co-culture models, 3D cultures or primary cell models should be developed for relevant endpoints lacking, or having inadequate, in-vitro models. Transport through biological barriers could also be addressed, for instance with the objective of assessing the true internal dose of the materials to which living organisms are being exposed, as well as disease models or models with impaired barriers.
Low-level chronic exposure is a likely scenario as many ENMs will probably exist at very low concentrations in the environment and potentially be persistent. Thus, assays and models with low chronic exposure, elucidating toxicokinetics, different mechanisms of action and adverse outcome pathways, as well as specific disease models, should be developed and assessed against appropriate animal studies and could include for instance effects on kinetics, growth, reproduction, metabolism, and behaviour. Research could also focus on long-term, ecologically relevant, effects in realistic environmental concentrations of ENMs.
The transformations in biological or environmental matrices have been demonstrated as having potentially significant effect on the ENM tests results. Therefore, dosing with realistic exposure levels and conditions should be an integral part of the developments, taking into consideration the dynamic and complex nature of environmentally induced transformations with realistic external and internal forms and levels of exposure.
For validation purposes and to ensure that the experimental results can form a solid and meaningful basis for grouping, read-across, and modelling purposes, the testing should be performed on sets of well-defined and characterised libraries of nanomaterials and, when possible, on nanomaterials for which high-quality in-vivo data are already existing (to minimize animal testing).
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for international cooperation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 10 and 13 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

An integral part of the LEIT-NMP part of Horizon 2020 is to organise events of a major strategic nature. Examples are events organised together with successive EU presidencies; and also EuroNanoForum, Manufuture, NMP Conferences and World Manufacturing Forum. The proposed Support Action(s) should contribute to creating better synergy between initiatives launched by the Commission and by the Member States, to the benefit of the coherence of the overall actions within the field of research and innovation within the Industrial Leadership part. Member States which will hold a forthcoming Presidency of the European Union are Malta and United Kingdom in 2017 and they may be particularly interested in this topic.
Scope:
In order to ensure high political and strategic relevance, the active involvement of the competent National Authority(ies) will be evaluated.
Proposals should address topics of major relevance at the time of the events. An appropriate equilibrium should be present in the proposed action(s), with balanced presentations of various research and industrial elements and points of view. The conferences organisers should use modern technologies in all phases of the event life cycle, and should include interactive sessions. Outreach activities may be included, such as a press programme or events dedicated to the wider public or schools.
The Member States holding a Presidency of the European Union in the same year are invited to liaise in order to avoid overlaps, and to ensure that each event has clearly identified objectives, messages and target groups.
The commitment of the national authorities to support the event(s) (from a political point of view, but also with resources) should be a pre-requisite to submit a proposal. The application should be supported by the competent Minister, in a letter added to the application.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 300 000 and 600 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Facilitate trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) within the Industrial leadership Part with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants.
Scope:
Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of LEIT-NMBP. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the theme, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training, and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the Industrial Leadership part, with the possible inclusion of interdisciplinary approaches, e.g. by involving Social Sciences and Humanities. It should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Science with and for Society’.
The proposal consortium can include only NCPs from EU Member States and Associated Countries, who have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities. The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops).
NCPs from third countries who have been officially appointed by the relevant authorities are also welcome to participate in the project activities.
The costs incurred by the consortium for participation of officially appointed NCPs from EU Member States and Associated countries not participating in the consortium, and from officially appointed NCPs from third countries on the official list in part A of the General Annexes of the General Work Programme, e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium, may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.

","22 October 2014
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Additive manufacturing (AM) delivers a new manufacturing paradigm: it makes the rapid, distributive manufacture of complex objects possible, and has the potential to reduce waste. What is truly transformative about additive manufacturing is the potential to manufacture individual products anywhere in the world, and to customise each of them. Rather than make manufactured goods in one place and ship them around the world, additive manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing makes it possible to send design blueprints instantaneously via the internet, and manufacture them when and where they are needed.
3D printers are growing in sophistication, and can create increasingly complex objects, including those with different component parts. Breakthroughs in techniques such as metal sintering and processing of ceramic materials mean that 3D printers are no longer restricted to generic plastics. The use of nanoparticles in 3D printing is progressing rapidly, and could vastly increase the range of products that can be manufactured in this way.
Scope: As a part of a wider initiative towards nano-manufacturing, the objective of this topic is to advance the state-of-the art of AM materials through modification of their fundamental material properties using nanotechnology and to develop novel additive manufacturing techniques that incorporate new functionalities and/or significant performance increase, e.g. by utilising printable high-strength materials in the manufactured components. For example, carbon nanotube or other functional nano-structures could be embedded and combined with the printing process to perform electronic functions such as sensing and communications, or bio materials, such as flexible polymers or ceramics could be used to create bio-inspired structures.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 4-5. Implemented as cross-KET activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Enabling Europe to compete at the forefront of the additive manufacturing revolution, which in the long term will lead into entire new production and consumption paradigms;
                Enabling manufacturing activities by SMEs to enter markets with innovations that were not possible before;
                Widening the range of available AM materials and functionalities in products will accelerate the transition of AM from mere prototyping towards production and use;
                Enabling functionality embedded in AM parts displaces the need for multiple manufacturing operations, making AM processes even more cost effective, including for small series production;
                Enabling the identification of future development needs in related fields, e.g. in seamless design-to-manufacturing software and standardization for material and process quality.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: In nanomedicine the scale-up of nanopharmaceuticals production from pre-clinical laboratory scale to the quantity and GMP quality needed for clinical testing is severely hindered by a lack of pilot manufacturing capacity and supply infrastructure. The quantities required for clinical testing studies are modest (e.g. in the order of ten to hundred grams), but such pilot processes do not fit easily into existing manufacturing plants. The lack of a pilot manufacturing supply chain is especially problematic for SMEs and other organisations that do not have the necessary resources to develop the processes in-house.
Scope: Projects shall develop one or more pilot lines and processes for the scaling-up of the production of innovative nanopharmaceuticals to the quantities needed for clinical testing, taking into account the medical regulatory requirements. The pilot lines shall be developed with the appropriate characterisation and quality control processes. Relevant medical regulatory requirements must be taken into account. Projects shall address industrial sustainablity from an economic, environmental and social point of view. The nanopharmaceuticals selected for scaling-up shall be translatable and in an advanced stage of pre-clinical development, with positives perspectives to proceed to clinical testing. Clinical testing itself is not part of the project. Scaling-up of nanopharmaceuticals production intended primarily for the therapy of cancer is excluded from the scope of this topic as it is addressed in topic NMP 11.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
The implementation of this proposal is intended to start at TRL 4-5 and target TRL 6-7. Implemented as cross-KET activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Improve GMP nanopharmaceuticals supply for enabling clinical trials, further validating and demonstrating the effectiveness of nanopharmaceuticals for medical therapies;
                Leveraging of existing investments in successful pre-clinical nanomedicine research;
                Increase of the attractiveness of Europe as a location-of-choice to carry out advanced medical research and product development, due to improved nanopharmaceuticals supply capacity.

Specific challenge: Many innovative nano-biomedical developments are initiated by small companies. However, they often miss the necessary knowledge of the regulatory requirements for translation of their ideas, of the market and of the financial aspects of funding the developments and the business. The development and supply chain also show shortcomings. SMEs are often fragmented, dispersed and rarely organised in representative associations to address these problems with the result of missed opportunities for innovation. This is especially true in nanomedicine, covering diagnostics, therapeutics and regenerative medicine.
Scope: In order to alleviate this problem, the ETP Nanomedicine developed the concept of a 'Translation Hub'. This Coordination and Support Action shall provide advice and follow-up at all stages of the research and development and provide examples of best practice to European R&D teams in nano-bio-medicine. It shall provide SMEs and other organisations with a technological and business oriented assessment of their technologies and provide business advice before engaging further resources and efforts for preclinical and clinical tests.
The Coordination and Support Action shall network SMEs, aiming to improve their knowledge of translation in a sustainable way; to build bridges with academia and hospitals; and to link them with large companies and investors. It shall provide education and training in translation and entrepreneurship to academia and SMEs and help the showcasing of preclinical or early clinical proofs of concepts to large companies and investors. It will assist nanomedicine research projects in better anticipating the requirements of the translation process, in order to improve the probability of the developments to reach the market. It will also seek synergies with other relevant SME support networks.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one proposal will be funded.
Expected impact:
                Reinforce support to European SMEs and academia as drivers of innovations in nanomedicine, by assisting them in the development of their bottom-up ideas, going from pre-clinical proof of concept to late clinical trials.
                Improve the innovation capacity of the European nano-bio-medical sector – especially at the level of SMEs - through catalysing a more effective translation process from research into industrial marketable products.
                Improve the knowledge in the research community of the translation, regulatory and business aspects of new nano-biomedical developments, leading to more efficient use of resources and research.

Specific challenge: Promising pre-clinical nano-medicine proof-of-concepts have been developed for the therapy of cancer, but their translation into clinical therapies remains a major challenge. An important bottleneck is up-scaling under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions for the production of the nanomedicines from the pre-clinical laboratory scale to the quantity needed for clinical testing.
Scope: The aim is to translate promising novel nano-technology enabled therapies for cancer with pre-clinical proof-of-concept, from a pre-clinical lab stage up to Phase I clinical testing. The project shall start from an established pre-clinical proof-of-concept, with relevant efficacy and toxicity data. The project shall be focused on the translation process, so that ultimately new effective therapies can be introduced to the European healthcare market. An important aspect is the development of a pilot line for scaling-up the production of the nanomedicines and the quality control, taking into account GMP and medical regulatory requirements. Projects may include the later stages of pre-clinical testing and Phase 1 clinical testing, but the latter is not a requirement. Nanopharmaceuticals may be manufactured with either a top-down or a bottom-up approach, using for example self-assembling technology. Applicants must describe, according to industrial criteria, how the various barriers for advancing their new therapy to clinical application will be overcome, including technical, IPR, competitive, commercial and regulatory criteria, with efficacy and toxicity. Attention must be paid to clinical trial design and the foreseen research and commercial path to market introduction has to be well outlined.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
The research is to be implemented from TRL 4/5 and target TRL 6/7. Implemented as cross-KET activities.

Specific challenge: Diabetes mellitus and its associated pathologies have become a major public health problem. They cause significant physical and psychological morbidity, disability and premature mortality among those affected and imposes a heavy financial burden on health services.[1]  The ultimate goal for all curative diabetes research is an effective long-lasting blood glucose normalisation and stabilisation for both type I and type II diabetic patients, at levels comparable to those achieved by intensive insulin therapy in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). Despite improvements in insulin pharmaceutical efficacy and delivery methods, this approach still has major limitations, significantly impacting on patients’ quality of life.
Scope: Proposals should develop one or more functional biomaterials for the long-term clinical efficacy of transplanted pancreatic islets, and the safe and reliable harvesting of cells from identified source(s), which facilitate highly sensitive identification/screening and sorting of isolated cells; allow for easy handling and safe storage of isolated cells and/or tissue engineering constructs; provide immunoprotection and facilitate construct grafting in target anatomical areas; as well as clinically-reflective in vitro models useful as indicators of long-term in vivo behaviour. A realistic endpoint of the project should be described and justified. Proposals should generate comprehensive pre-clinical data and after completion of the project, the material should be in an optimal position for entering clinical trials or, in case of innovative diagnostic tools, for the validation stage. Preclinical regulatory matters, including the investigational medicinal product dossier (IMPD), should be completed or taken to an advanced stage. Experimental protocols should be planned in accordance with the provisions of the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP) Regulation. Also, the standardisation and manufacturing process can be addressed including up-scaling and good manufacturing practice (GMP).
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Improvement of the quality of life of both Type I and Type II patients with diabetes mellitus;
                Reduced direct and indirect costs linked to the disease and its treatment, and wide availability of treatments;

Scope: Proposals should aim at developing and demonstrating in relevant industrial environments the synthesis and functionalisation of nano-materials for printing applications with high process throughput. Technical challenges relate to the optimisation of the synthesis process for controlling the crystallinity and morphology of functional materials, as well as obtaining the rheological properties needed for wet deposition technologies. Post and in-process characterisation methods should be addressed to ensure a stable, sustainable production process. The developed nanomaterials (inks) formulations should demonstrate functionality, process compatibility, non-toxicity, environmental friendliness (e.g. aqueous media) and low-cost.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.

Specific challenge: Encapsulation technologies have been widely used for a long time in the pharmaceutical industry for drug delivery applications. The emergence of nanotechnology and the availability of novel tools have paved the way for a new type of nanomatrices and nanocapsules, which can be used for targeted delivery and can carry payloads for localised action in many application fields.
Scope: Proposals should address applications for safe, controlled and reliable novel nanomatrices and nanocapsules containing active ingredients (e.g. drugs in nanomedicine, vitamins or anti-oxidants for cosmetic and personal care products, or cleaning and antimicrobial agents for housecleaning products), as well as their manufacturing processes. Different types of nanomatrices and nanocapsules are required, depending on the nature of the material (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) to be incorporated. Technical challenges relate to the production techniques involved (such as coacervation or phase separation) for improving the stability of the nano formulation and the active ingredients (payload) involved; development of novel mechanisms for the release of the payload (e.g. in response to changes in temperature or pH) is a further challenge. Nanomatrices or nanocapsules as carriers for targeted delivery could also be addressed. Safety considerations and contribution to standardization should be an integral part of the projects.

Specific challenge: The electrification of road transport is a key towards sustainable and environmentally friendly mobility of persons and transport of goods, in particular for short range transport and transport in urban areas.  In order to reach this goal it is important to develop improved cost competitive and sustainable storage technologies for Electrified Vehicles (EV) achieving significantly improved performance with respect to current lithium-ion electrochemical storage technology, to allow the production of EVs that more closely match the performance of current internal combustion vehicles (e.g. and in particular considering the driving range). This challenge is complementary to a separate one present in the “Transport Challenges” Work Programme.[1] This is also in line with the Roadmap of the European Green Vehicle Initiative (EGVI). Research and innovation should build on the progress already obtained through previous projects, particularly those funded within the Green Car Public Private Partnership. It is however important for the European competitiveness that the next generation of batteries will be “made”, i.e. developed and produced in Europe.
Scope: To achieve progress well beyond current lithium-ion cell technologies, various key factors have to be improved at the same time, such as: energy density, power density, the ability to work under severe thermal conditions, charging speed, and inherent safety of the battery cells including crash and abuse conditions. And the ageing of the new chemistries has to be thoroughly understood and improved, in order to achieve a longer battery lifetime. In addition, the future battery has to have a competitive cost; it has also to be produced in an environmental friendly way, considering the availability of raw materials and the batteries’ recycling potential, as well as a sound life cycle assessment. And the knowledge on production-technology and -capacity of cells, packs and systems should be made available. The scope may be reached e.g. by addressing new chemistries that allow high-energy densities, and by developing related specific new materials e.g. for cathodes and electrolytes. In order to accelerate the industrial take-up of the proposed solution, the development of prototypes should be included to show clear progress beyond existing post lithium-ion technology in terms of durability, cyclability and energy density, with consideration of scalability up to full scale for automotive applications.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 4.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Significant improvements of the usability of EVs, with extended driving range and improved battery durability (recharging, cyclability and safety) obtainable at competitive costs. The energy density of the proposed new batteries should reach at least twice the energy density in comparison to the best in class Li-Ion technology at the same power density;
                Better acceptance of EV in society, and thus contribution to the improvements of sustainable transport, reducing pollution and noise in urban areas;
                European competitiveness through development of new key technology and related production capacities.

Specific challenge: The recent communication ‘Promoting cultural and creative sectors for growth and jobs in the EU’ highlighted the competitive advantage that creative and cultural inputs bring to the European industries. The most obvious example is the wider use of design in manufacturing industries, adding value to products, services, processes and market structures. Firms spending twice the average amount on creative inputs are 25% more likely to introduce product innovations (COM(2012)537).To promote design-driven innovation, a number of action lines have been endorsed by the Commission, including integrating design into research and development and promoting new collaborative innovation strategies (‘Implementing an Action Plan for Design-Driven Innovation’, SWD(2013)380).
An innovative, design-driven, sustainable approach in conceiving, developing, producing, using and recycling materials can be effective in strengthening the competiveness and success of the European creative industries linked to manufacturing (e.g. architecture, automotive, art, crafts, supports for cultural items, decoration, fashion, furniture, lighting, interior design materials and products, jewels, luxury, media supports, publishing, sport and toys), adding value to products and processes also by ‘intangible’ factors (e.g. trend translation, enhanced sensations, values) .
Scope: Proposals should address the development of innovative material solutions for use in the creative industry sectors based on waste or process by-products to produce new materials or adopting bio-mimetic approaches. A sustainable and socially responsible approach to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact should be clearly demonstrated. Proof of concept in terms of product and/or process must be delivered within the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes (in compliance with European Commission Communication 2006/C323/01), but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs.
In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the research efforts, the cost effectiveness and commercial potential of the innovative technologies compared to state-of-the-art solutions currently available on the market should be convincingly assessed in the proposal. The active participation of designers, societal stakeholders, materials suppliers, manufacturers and end users of the resulting products represents an added value and this will be reflected in the second stage of the evaluation.

Specific challenge: The need to develop materials which can perform well in severe operating environments is increasing with advances in technology and requirements for higher efficiency in all areas such as manufacturing, energy, transport and communications, deep-sea technologies etc. Another important driver for advanced functionalities, e.g. self-diagnosis and self-healing, comes from the incorporation of nanoscale and molecular materials components. This poses a major challenge for materials science, and requires a fundamental understanding of how the processing, microstructure, nanostructure and properties of such material interact in order to enhance their response under more severe conditions.
The general aim is to develop new products or components with a step change in efficiency or performance compared to existing ones, for operation in e.g. high radiation environments, highly corrosive environments, under high friction conditions, low temperature environments, deep sea or space environments, or other extreme climate conditions.
Scope: Projects should develop bulk materials that can function within an aggressive environment without property degradation, synthesise new structures with useful properties, and force chemical reactions that normally result in damage to proceed along selected pathways that are either benign or initiate the self-repair of damage.
Projects should include appropriate numerical tools (e.g. density functional theory, molecular dynamics) to capture the multi-scale evolution of damage (e.g. friction/corrosion or corrosion/irradiation synergies should be considered); and predictive modelling tools for materials operating in extreme environments. Standardisation and/or the production of (certified) reference materials may also be addressed as an integrated part of the proposal. Proof of concept in terms of product and/or process must be delivered within the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes, but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs. The cost effectiveness and commercial potential of the innovative technologies compared to state-of-the-art solutions currently available on the market should be quantified during the project, with the involvement of end users.

Specific challenge: The future of the European industry relies inter alia on a strong modelling capacity. An efficient approach is needed to shorten the development process of materials-enabled products, being a key to the global competitiveness of industry. Existing models describe the behaviour of different physical entities, and thus several models need to be linked to cover all scales and arrive at industrial relevant results. The coverage of a single model should be expanded to reduce the necessity of linking. In addition, today’s material models often lack accuracy, especially when describing product properties connected to the material behaviour.
Scope: Proposals should elaborate the physics and chemistry involved in an existing model to extend the length and time scales to which this model can be applied. The model to be expanded can be an electronic, atomistic, mesoscopic or continuum scale model; where the discrete electronic, atomistic and mesoscopic model describes the behaviour of electrons, atoms and nanoparticles/grains respectively, and a continuum model describes the behaviour of continuum unit cells.[1] There is a special need for the expansion of discrete mesoscopic models. Proof of the possibility to design new materials and/or materials processes with the expanded physics/chemistry must be delivered within the project.
The extended model should be implemented in a code integrated in a multi-scale approach available to end-users and demonstrate the reduced need of linking due to the extended coverage of the model.
The proposals should include interface design to facilitate the future implementation in larger and extendable framework architecture. Proposals should contain a series of model validation in which the model is validated against a chain of experimental data of increasing complexity relevant to materials design leading up to and including realistic test cases. These data should either be collected during the project or exist already. The extended model should be implemented in a code integrated in a multi-scale approach available to end-users. As part of each project, industrial end-users should assess this code on predefined industrial test cases, to guarantee industrial relevance.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5.

Specific challenge: Currently, power generation requires enormous amounts of cooling water, ranking second to the volume of water used for agriculture. As an example, a typical 500 MW thermal electricity plant equipped with a cooling tower evaporates 26 million litres of water per day (the equivalent of the daily water consumption of more than 43 000 EU families). Once-through cooling systems consume less water but withdraw significantly more: the same plant equipped with a once-through system would withdraw typically 1.4 billion litres of water per day, returning it to the water source about 10-15°C warmer. Such systems not only impose serious burdens on the local water management and the environment, but also limit the development of distributed power generation (foreseen by the SET plan) by their stringent requirements concerning cooling. The lack of adequate cooling water may even lead to power plant shutdowns.
Scope: Proposals should develop robust materials solutions for optimising cooling in thermal power plants by
                Allowing their functioning at higher temperatures, thus increasing their efficiency and reducing the amount of water withdrawn or consumed;
                Allowing the use of alternative cooling fluids (including air-based or hybrid coolants); and
                Increasing the available effective water supply, either by permitting to upgrade the quality of the water (e.g. using membranes) or by improving the robustness of the cooling equipment. Proposals should include activities to test the proposed solutions in relevant existing pilot plants.
Note: Thermal power plants include, inter alia, plants fired by coal, natural gas, liquid fossil fuels, as well as geothermal and solar thermal plants. Non-thermal power plants, such as wind turbines or PV plants/installations consume considerably less water during their operational life; projects should not focus on materials solutions to reduce the water consumption in such non-thermal plants.

Specific challenge: Functional materials are enabling the large scale market penetration of secure, sustainable and affordable energy based on low-carbon, decentralised power generation. The benefits of using advanced functional materials can often be demonstrated in terms of, e.g., more efficient energy generation, storage or transmission, under controlled conditions. The high up-front investment costs of new power plants or decentralised sources requires lifetimes of the order of 20 to 25 years, with minimal down and service time. However, not enough is known about the degradation of such materials during long-term service. This can seriously hamper the industrial uptake of such materials, increase initial investment costs due to the over-specification of the material requirements; or increase the exploitation costs, either by increased downtimes due to materials related failure or because of more intensive maintenance schedules.
Scope: Proposals should investigate the long-term in-service degradation of functional materials that have already demonstrated enhanced performance in terms of energy capture, conversion, storage and/or transmission, and the capability of a production at a scale that could warrant an industrial uptake. Proposals must include relevant modelling and testing under realistic conditions at pilot level. They should focus on improving the practical understanding of long-term in-service degradation on the performance of the functional material and its impact on the overall performance of the technology components and systems. The development of improved materials solutions, as well as relevant roadmaps and a catalogue of good practices, should be included.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.

Specific challenge: The fragmentation of research efforts has long been identified as a major European weakness. A significant part of national R&D budgets is spent without substantial coordination across the Union, a significant waste of resources at a time of shrinking funding possibilities.
A dynamic structure, following materials research and innovation across the European Union, is called for. The goal is to make Europe a more coherent system, and also to help in better coordinating future EU materials activities with those in Member States, Associated Countries, industry and academia, to avoid duplications and gaps.
Scope: Support to a monitoring system and a forum to debate developments and needs, identify gaps and opportunities, establish priorities in order to create a sound, authoritative, consensual, science-based, economy pushed, society-driven Europe-wide knowledge base of materials science and engineering. Synergy with or use of present structures and existing schemes is welcome.
The proposal for the support action should describe the expected level of detail in the study, definitions and limitations, the parameters to be observed, and the targeted application fields. The support action may include assessment, benchmarking, road mapping, foresight, coordination, organisation of events, and communication, and give indications in which application areas research and innovation may have most impact. A study of activities carried out within and outside Horizon 2020, through other EU schemes (European Structural and Investment Funds and national activities etc.) may be included. The proposal should also provide elements for a constant monitoring system, as well as success cases and best practices stemming from FP-supported research. The organisation of major events of relevance for better structuring the ERA in the materials field, with priority to those federating individual events that in the past took place separately, may also be included.

Specific challenge:For small series production of, for instance, consumer goods, the traditional supply chains are not suitable. Although internet sales, both B2C and B2B, are fast growing, most of the underlying supply models are still traditional. The change to a faster supply of smaller series and fully personalised products is hampered by the fact that current industrial supply chains are mainly cost-driven, resulting in large series and long lead times. Supply and demand are not in balance. Quality and customer satisfaction are often compromised. Moreover actual production is taking place anywhere in the world and does insufficiently take into account issues of social, environmental and energy sustainability.
Scope: The internet has the potential to support a fully new supply chain model that is fully customer driven. New business solutions should enable consumers to become designers and ""customisers""; retailers to become virtual business brokers; manufacturers to produce in a distributed and small scale manner; and suppliers to be more flexible and demand-driven.
Research activities should focus on all of the following areas:
•   Integrated business model solutions for customer-driven supply chain management.
•   Practical solutions for the ownership, control and management of the related supply chain data
•  Novel distributed manufacturing, sourcing and design solutions linking individual ""home-based"" designers and manufacturers to the supply-chain promoting social inclusion and deploying skills locally available.
•  Solutions for local sourcing and supply, thus reducing the environmental footprint.
The projects are expected to include use-case demonstrations aiming at rapid deployment of the novel business solutions in particular consumer-targeted domains. All relevant supply-chain stakeholders are expected to participate.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.

•  Return of delocalised manufacturing to Europe, in the order of at least 5% of the total manufacturing capacity, in the application area targeted by the project, within 5 years after the end of project;
•  Reduction in the environmental footprint compared to products produced in the traditional value chains by 20% through less stock, less waste, and less transportation;
•  Creation of a novel supply network involving at least 100 organisations and individuals at the end of the project and 1000 organisations and individuals within 5 years after the end of project;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With smaller manned and unmanned platforms increasingly being used for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions, there is a strong need to design compact, highly performing and lightweight multifunction RF systems. Moreover, with an increasing range of multifunction RF systems and new EW threats appearing rapidly, such platforms should also be resilient to operate in the presence, react to and supress such systems and threats when participating in military operations and playing a role in the battlefield. A complex yet very promising solution is to develop European advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology allowing an optimal combination of radar, communication and EW functions into a single multifunction RF system.
Europe has a strong position in advanced military RF systems. Yet the risks are high that the Union becomes severely dependent on suppliers established in third countries for this critical defence technology. This not only limits the strategic autonomy of the Member States but also generates security-of-supply risks. End-user restrictions imposed by third countries (e.g., the US International Traffic in Arms and Export Administration Regulations (ITAR and EAR)) already endanger the security-of-supply of essential electronic components of certain RF systems.
To remove such important limitations, a research and technological development (R&T) action, potentially later on followed by further and/or development actions, needs to be initialised to design and build in Europe a multifunction RF system based on AESA technology for a broad range of applications, to become available for defence applications in several military domains within the next decade.
Scope:
European multifunction RF systems should integrate several functionalities in one system. This approach requires new system design technologies and the use of new architectural frameworks as well as the integration of electronic components. This would allow the sharing of many RF components and building blocks, managing these via an intelligent automated resource management system, leading to savings in size, weight, power as well as cost and capability benefits. Care should be taken to ensure optimal performance of the overall system whilst keeping it modular and scalable.
At the component level, high-power, high-frequency, broadband components, highly performant under harsh military conditions are key enablers for the realisation of multifunction RF systems. As an example, incremental advances in Si or GaAs-based transistors resulted in operating respectively into the low GHz range and medium power levels. This is no longer sufficient to meet the current demand of increasing the carrier frequencies, achieving broader, instantaneous and tuneable bandwidths, and delivering higher power and efficiencies. For this, completely new devices based on advanced materials, architectures and processes need to be developed and reliably fabricated in relatively large volumes.
As an example, next generation systems, such as photonics-based systems amongst other technologies, are even based on very different technologies, primarily to reach higher performance in the frequency domain while avoiding noisy up and down conversions. This would allow, for example, for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging with superior resolution, broadband ES and EA operation, as well as high-bandwidth data transmission and improved sensor resilience.
Proposals need to include in the proposed activities both (1) a R&D assessment with a criticality mapping and (2) the implementation of balanced R&T activities at system as well as at component level, based on the assessment and criticality mapping.
The proposal should include a high-level description of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the envisaged functionalities and the methodologies on how to measure them. A report with a detailed description of these KPIs and methodologies should be delivered within 6 months after the start of the project.
1. R&D assessment
Proposals should cover an R&D assessment for a joint Union development programme for a multifunction RF (radar, EW and communication) system based on AESA technology without end-user restrictions by third countries, including a technology roadmap. A size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) and cooling analysis should be performed to support the proposed solutions, and a cost estimate provided for the development of a prototype (TRL 7) by 2027 based on technologies without end-user restrictions by third countries.
The operational use will be based on the ability of the system to provide radar, EW as well as communication functions[1].
The system definition should be in line with the following technical requirements:
the three functionalities should be integrated in a single aerial platform and ideally adaptable to more types of platforms, with an appropriate surveillance and reconnaissance, classification and identification, targeting and fire control, communications and EW capability and the possibility for single antennas/pods to concurrently perform some of them and to switch efficiently between them;
the use of AESA for EW applications such as ES for detection and identification of waveforms and EA for countering threats should be analysed and assessed in the framework of multifunction system;
the system should fully cover a bandwidth of 2-18 GHz and partially address regions of the electromagnetic spectrum up to 40 GHz.
Moreover, fully-electronic RF systems[2] should also comply with:
the waveform (radar, EW, and communication) shall be digital, i.e., it will be stored and/or processed in digital format, and converted to analogue signal for transmission. In the design, the concepts of Software Defined Radar should be used;
the antenna pattern should be formed by digital means, i.e., the information (phase or time) to compose the antenna pattern should be sent in a digital format to each - preferably digital - Transmit Receive Module (TRM) which will generate the appropriate signal to the radiating element to form the beam pattern.
The architecture and the functional specifications of the building blocks of the multifunction AESA-based system should be compatible for use in an aerial system, with the possibility to fully or partially adapt the technologies for other systems which are very demanding in terms of SWaP-C. The values of the performance parameters for all three functions and the concurrent modes capability should be analysed in detail.
Concepts of employment and use of the system should be provided as part of the assessment.
The architecture should allow the system to adapt its performance to future improved characteristics of the enabling components and technologies.
Criticality mapping
Applicants should propose a criticality mapping to identify materials, components and/or technologies that need foremost priority support because of technological or economic bottlenecks. Insufficient R&D capacity in the Union at the early stages of the development as well as a lack of industrial capacity (including skills) towards the pre-manufacturing stages of the multifunction AESA-based system should be mapped. End-user restrictions imposed by third countries should be avoided.
The deliverables related to the R&D assessment and the criticality mapping will be annexed to the Special Report[3].
2. R&T activities
The applicants should propose R&T activities at the system level as well as at the component level in line with the proposed roadmap and criticality mapping.
a. System level
The objective of the proposed RF AESA-based system is to demonstrate the joint and coordinated operation of radar, EW and communications functions in at least a laboratory environment.
In order to achieve this objective, research activities should therefore cover developments, or at least show tangible progress on the following areas:
broadband antenna array with particular attention to grating lobes and electronic scanning performance;
for fully-electronic RF systems, a digital beam former with multi-beam capability in Tx/Rx for EW;
a resource manager able to coordinate the EW functions with the radar and communication ones in order to optimise the overall system performance in various scenarios.
Applicants can decide the extent to which they will cover in their proposal each of the above areas.
b. Component level
Research activities should cover at least one design-fabrication-test cycle of a high-power, high-frequency, high as well as instantaneous and tunable bandwidth Transmit/Receive (Tx/Rx) module. Consortia should thereby rely on the production capabilities of ideally more than one trustable[4] fab or foundry established in the Union.
Solutions to optimise the heat dissipation and achieve better and more cost-effective packaging of the integrated circuits should be included in the proposals.
A high-level description of the KPIs for state-of-the-art performance of the envisaged functionalities, and of the methodologies on how to measure them should be included for both subtopics. A report with a detailed description of these KPIs and methodologies should be delivered within 6 months after the start of the project.
Hardware and software products used or developed in the context of both sub-topics should not be subject to non-EU export control regulations.
The solutions or technologies proposed for the defence domain could also be assessed for other potential use, in particular in the security and space domain[5],
When relevant, results publicly available from EDA and NATO activities and studies should be taken into account for the proposed work. The activities included in the proposals should clearly differentiate from or go beyond work already covered under relevant themes of the Union Research and Innovation Framework Programmes.
The implementation of both R&T subtopics is intended to target at least TRL 4.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Union between EUR 9 000 000 and 10 000 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
The lifetime of the proposed project should not exceed 30 months.
Expected Impact:
convincing demonstration of the potential of Union funded research in support of Union critical defence technologies, in particular in the domain of multifunction RF system;
establish a R&D assessment including a technology roadmap towards a joint Union development programme for a multifunction RF system based on AESA technology with milestones and estimated budget needs;
ensure secure and autonomous availability of multifunction RF systems to military end-users by 2027;

","21 March 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Anticipated and ongoing advances in several technology areas will continue to have a substantial impact on the defence sector. Emerging technological directions need to be explored and consolidated, in order to analyse and exploit their disruptive potential on the defence sector. The communities that are able to drive this forward need to be encouraged to extend from the participating consortia to a wider European pool of expertise, thus stimulating the emergence of a European innovation eco-system with strong relations with the defence sector around a new technological paradigm, well beyond the world of research alone, including military end-users.
Scope:
Proposals are sought for cutting-edge high-risk/high-reward research projects that aim to demonstrate a new technological paradigm within the scope of one or more of the following sub-topics. Applicants can submit proposals which are in scope of several sub-topics but are requested to indicate one sub-topic as the main scope of the proposed research activities.
1. Autonomous positioning, navigation and timing
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have a profound impact on military positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) services which however critically depend on reliable satellite signals. The availability of these signals cannot be assured under all conditions because operations can take place in GNSS denied/contested environments or because of the physical limitations of the current technology.
A promising complementary device would be autonomous PNT sources that can be used without the need for position or timing updates. Relevant factors for considered solutions should be low drift, small scale, power-efficiency and integrability.
2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) for defence
The ambition of achieving Artificial Intelligence (AI) drives promising breakthrough technologies, expected to become significant in many fields in the area of defence. Their potential for the defence domain is huge, as AI solutions are expected to play an important role in critical fields such as cyber defence, C4ISR systems, intelligent and autonomous unmanned systems and swarms, electronic warfare, data fusion, logistics and maintenance optimization, information processing and intelligence analysis, mission planning and control, war gaming and training, which could radically accelerate the cycle of military operations and deeply influence the military practices.
Proposals are invited for research activities that apply AI in defence technologies in any part of the military capability spectrum, including for cyber defence.
3. Quantum technologies for defence applications
The advancement of quantum technologies is expected to impact profoundly military operations. Quantum information processing, quantum communication, quantum key distribution and quantum sensing technologies will probably produce a paradigm shift in many fields, such as C4ISR, navigation, object and chemical detection etc.
Research proposals in this subtopic should address areas in quantum technologies with clear military applications.
4. Long-range effects
The operational challenges and specificities of the modern military missions and the rapidly growing cost of use of the defence systems require radical solutions for cost-efficient long-range precision strike. The separate or combined use of electromagnetic railguns, guided ammunition and hypervelocity projectiles, among other things, has been proposed and explored with promising results.
Proposals in this sub-area should feature research activities aimed towards solutions which would provide a disruptive change in the area of long-range fire support.
5. Augmenting soldier capacity
Soldiers have to operate in increasingly demanding and complex environments, performing different and multiple tasks. Soldiers' equipment becomes increasingly heavier and more complex, adding to the challenge of accomplishing their missions in a better, faster and more efficient way. Potential solutions for augmenting the capacity of the soldiers to perform their tasks have been studied, ranging from the enhancement of their physical capacities by using exoskeletons and robotic systems, to applying augmented reality for increased situational awareness.
Research in this area should propose solutions which would radically increase the capacity of the modern soldiers to perform physically demanding or mentally exhausting tasks..
The proposals should include a high-level description of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the envisaged functionalities and the methodologies on how to measure them. A report with a detailed description of these KPIs and methodologies should be delivered within 6 months after the start of the project.
When applicable, proposals should include an assessment of the ethical, legal and societal impact of the proposed solutions. The inclusion of an assessment of the ethical, legal and societal impact for all the proposed solutions for subtopics 2 and 5 is mandatory.
The implementation of this topic is intended to target TRL 3-4.
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution up to EUR 1 500 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The Commission intends to fund the highest ranked proposal per subtopic (with proposals being evaluated separately within each sub-category). In case none of the proposals submitted to one or more sub-topics are fundable, the proposals second ranked in each of the remaining sub-topics will be ranked following their evaluation score. This ranked list will determine the priority order of funding additional proposals within the limit of the available budget.
The lifetime of the proposed project should not exceed 24 months.
Expected Impact:
scientific and technological contributions to the development of a new future technology with target applications in the area of defence;
potential for future social or economic impact or market creation;

","30 January 2020","Specific Challenge:
To lay the foundations for radically new future technologies of any kind with unexpected impact, that aims to bring radical technological superiority over potential adversaries. This topic also encourages the driving role of new actors in defence research and innovation, including excellent young researchers, ambitious high-tech SMEs and visionary research centres of big companies and research and technology organisations.
Scope:
Proposals are sought for cutting-edge, high-risk/high-impact research leading to game-changing impact in a defence context. They must have all of the following essential characteristics:
a disruptive impact in a defence context: the proposal need to clearly address how the proposed solutions would create a disruptive effect when integrated in a realistic military operation;
radical vision: the proposal must address a clear and radical vision, enabled by a new technology concept that challenges current paradigms. In particular, research to advance on the roadmap of a well-established technological paradigm, even if high-risk, will not be funded;
breakthrough technological target: the proposal must target a novel and ambitious science-to-technology breakthrough as a first proof of concept for its vision. In particular, blue-sky exploratory research without a clear technological objective targeting defence applications will not be funded.
The inherently high risks of the research proposed shall be mitigated by a flexible methodology to deal with the considerable science-and-technology uncertainties and for choosing alternative directions and options.
Proposals should include an assessment of the ethical, legal and societal impact of the proposed solutions.
The implementation of this topic should not go beyond the delivery of a convincing experimental proof of concept.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Union of up to EUR 1 500 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The lifetime of the proposed project should not exceed 24 months.
Expected Impact:
scientific and technological contributions to the foundation of a future technology with disruptive applications in the area of defence;
potential for future social or economic impact or market creation;
building leading defence research and innovation capacity across Europe by involvement of key actors that can make a difference in the future, for example excellent young researchers, ambitious high-tech SMEs, visionary departments of big companies, research centres and universities;
convincing demonstration of the potential of EU-funded research for defence applications.
Funding awarded under this topic will take the form of lump sums as defined in Commission Decision C(2019) 1873."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
High-resolution and high-speed data acquisition impose ever stronger real-time requirements on data processing components on which an increasing number of defence applications critically depend upon in areas such as communications, electronic warfare, encryption, digital imaging, as well as radar and secure positioning, navigation and timing (PNT). General purpose processors show too low performance levels for critical processes in such defence applications.
Hence the need for defence-specific hard- and software approaches. These functionalities can be embedded in high-density electronic components that can be configured or even reconfigured[1] (such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays amongst others), are combined on a single System-on-Chip (SoC) or distributed over a Multi-Chip-Module (or other System-in-Package (SiP) solutions). The selection of the preferred technological solution should strike a balance between the requirements of the defence application(s) (in terms of, e.g., bandwidth, latency, flexibility, cryptologic restrictions, spatial requirements, power consumption), and economic drivers (such as the number of units expected to be produced, time to enter into service, the upfront costs (e.g., to non-recurring engineering), maintenance needs).
Performant (re)configurable SoC/SiPs are commercially available for a wide variety of applications in civil domains including medical and consumer electronics, automotive, and high performance computing. Using (re)configurable SoC/SiPs in (aero)space and defence applications adds stringent requirements for operation under harsh conditions. Moreover, military users need to be sure that these components can be trusted for use, e.g., in security systems, communication equipment and encryption algorithms available without restrictions.
For these technologies which are critical for a number of defence applications, the EU is currently fully dependent on suppliers established in non-EU countries, which implies risks of supply chains and vulnerabilities in terms of security. Furthermore, a number of regulations of non-EU nations can impose end-user restrictions on the use of the technologies (e.g., the US International Traffic in Arms and Export Administration Regulations (ITAR and EAR)). Setting up a EU-based supply chain for high-performance, trustable (re)configurable SoC/SiP for defence applications would contribute to remove these important limitations, as well as creating business opportunities in other highly demanding sectors beyond the defence sector.
Scope:
Proposals should design and validate a SoC/SiP and as such make a substantial contribution towards the development and manufacturing of European high-performance, trustable (re)configurable SoC/SiP suitable for multiple defence applications[2].
Design considerations and engineering decisions on the architecture of the SoC/SiP should thereby be driven by the state-of-the-art requirements of the selected defence applications. In particular long-term operation under harsh conditions, such as severe temperature variations, intense vibrations, and elevated radiation levels, as well as specific power requirements, should be adequately taken into account.
The design has to take into account that the manufacturing needs of the SoC/SiP should match the production capabilities of ideally more than one trustable fab or foundry established in the EU. In parallel to the proposed advances at the hardware level, advancing innovative development and debugging tools should be explored. They should enable to work at a high level of abstraction to design, simulate, integrate, synthesise, and test systems on the target device. Enhanced performance and shorter development times should be demonstrated by removing the debugging barrier between the processor and the (re)configurable component of the SoC/SiP.
Proposals should pay particular attention to security protection of the proposed hardware and software solutions.
The SoC/SiP architecture should be protected from intrusion or attacks, e.g., by secure boot mechanisms, embedding encryption engines, anti-tamper (which can be based on emerging technologies such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF)), anti-reverse engineering techniques and TEMPEST protection ideally allowing unclassified handling of information. The design and manufacturing process should be highly controlled to exclude that weaknesses, back doors or Trojan horses are implemented in the hardware and software components and systems. Flexible packaging options should be offered for the SoC/SiP device. When requested known good dies (KGD) should be supplied as well. The proposed security measures should be in line with the recommendations issued by the relevant national crypto approval authorities (CAA) of at least two Member States or Norway to handle information up to the national equivalents of SECRET UE/EU SECRET provided under Council Decision 2013/488/EU [3] and Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2015/444[4].
Hardware and software products developed in the context of this topic should not be subject to non-EU export control regulations.
Proposals should include a size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C) analysis to support the proposed (re)configurable SoC/SiP technology as well as a high-level description of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for state-of-the-art performance of the envisaged functionalities, and the methodologies on how to measure them. A report with a detailed description of these KPIs and methodologies should be delivered within 6 months after the start of the project.
In order to meet future capacity and performance requirements, the components should be implemented in a technology node (minimum transistor feature size) of 28 nm or smaller.
If the proposed architecture includes a FPGA, the SoC/SiP need to include at least the following features:
200k Look-Up Table (LUTs);
Internal non-volatile memory;
Digital Signal Processing hard-macros;
Flexible interconnections between the DSP processing core, general processing cores and on- and off chip bridges and interfaces;
Encryption module and anti-tamper and TEMPEST protection (as set out above);
At least 10 Gb/s high-speed links / interfaces.
Deviations from the set of features listed above should be duly justified in view of the multiple defence applications envisaged.
The potential of the proposed solutions, in particular in the security and space domain[5], should be thoroughly explored.
When relevant, results publicly available from EDA and NATO activities and studies should be taken into account for the proposed work. The activities included in the proposals should clearly differentiate from or go beyond work already covered under relevant themes of the EU Research and Innovation Framework Programmes.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 2 to 3 and target TRL 5.
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the Union between EUR 8 000 000 and 12 000 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Directed energy systems, and in particular laser systems, are potential game changers in future military activities[1]. They are capable to engage rapidly and precisely with agile targets at a low operational cost per shot and with a reduced risk to certain types of collateral damage. This makes them particularly attractive to counter a variety of threats, ranging from asymmetric threats such as incoming, low cost unmanned vehicles to Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (RAM) or missiles which conventionally would require expensive countermeasures such as guided missiles. Laser systems also face a number of limitations, in particular their sensitivity to absorption and scattering which lead to decreased beam quality under adverse atmospheric conditions and hence reduce the circumstances in which the system can effectively be used.
In essence, the thermal interaction between the laser beam and the target ultimately leads to irreversible damage if the temperature of the target material can be raised sufficiently high. Therefore the laser output power should be as high as possible while maintaining a high beam quality to focus and lock the laser beam to a small spot size on the target. This allows reaching sufficiently high power densities to reduce the exposure time needed to induce critical failure of the target material.
Different designs based on different laser technologies have been developed to deliver output powers ranging from the kW-level up to several MW. The lower power levels are sufficient to affect soft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) at short ranges (several hundreds of meters up to the kilometre range) while airborne MW-laser systems demonstrated to be able to counter ballistic missiles from a distance of hundreds of kilometres.
Current research and development (R&D) efforts aim to develop laser systems that combine several or many high output powers with a compact design to enable integration in mobile platforms, such as ships, trucks or helicopters. The required laser output power is directly linked to the target(s) and their associated scenario(s), the laser system architecture and performance. As a first estimate, high quality laser beams with output powers higher than 100 kW would enable to address the full target spectrum from tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) up to certain types of missiles. Non-European countries have already demonstrated compact laser effectors generating up to 100 kW, and roadmaps are proposed to scale the powers well above the 100 kW level in the coming years. Over the last decade, the increase in the laser effector power in non-European countries relies merely on studies of new architectures, including incoherent, coherent and spectral beam combining.
In Europe, development programmes for single high power laser effectors do not go beyond power levels of 30 kW. Current European high power laser effectors rely mainly on non-European technology and are based on architectures that combine incoherent beams on the target.
The EU thus risks becoming fully dependent on suppliers established in non-EU countries for this critical defence technology. This not only limits the strategic autonomy of the Member States but also generates security-of-supply risks. End-user restrictions imposed by non-EU nations (e.g., the US International Traffic in Arms and Export Administration Regulations (ITAR and EAR)) already endanger the security-of-supply of essential components of such high power laser systems.
To remove such important limitations, a research and technological development (R&T) programme, later on followed by a development phase, needs to be initialised to design and build a European high power laser effector, to become available for defence applications within the next decade.
Scope:
European high power effectors should deliver an output power of well beyond 100 kW (in continuous mode) and operate at a high duty cycle. The output wavelength, the beam quality and the optical systems (including at least fast steering mirrors, and adaptive optics if deemed necessary) should be able to cope with variable atmospheric conditions, ranges which can be expected in specific scenarios and environmental safety constraints (to limit collateral damage, e.g., when used in densely populated urban areas). Graduated responses by varying the output power at the level of the source without beam quality degradation should be explored. The effector(s) could be integrated in current and future compact laser systems to be mounted on mobile (sea, land or air) platforms. Therefore, appropriate attention should be paid to reduced energy consumption and lower cooling requirements in accordance with the expected volume and power available for each platform. Solutions to lower the weight while keeping the design sufficiently rugged should be explored. Wall plug vs. optical efficiency of the laser effector must be clearly estimated. The duty cycle can be optimised for each type of platform due to integration constraints. Damage and lifetime predictions of the components of the effectors should be covered as well as simulations and modelling capacities.
Proposals need to include (a) a R&D assessment, including a technology roadmap, (b) a criticality mapping and deliver (c) R&T activities based on this assessment and mapping exercise.
(a) R&D assessment
A small part of the proposed budget should be dedicated to develop a R&D assessment, including a technology roadmap, describing the elements, timing and value chains needed for a joint EU development programme for laser effector(s) for defence applications to reach TRL 8 by 2027. The roadmap should address at least the following typical scenarios:
Countering RAM;
Countering missiles;
Countering rapid, small boats;
Countering tactical manned and unmanned aerial vehicles.
The assessment should furthermore identify specific measurement aspects related to high power laser beams, such as beam divergence and diameter, wavefront aberration, power density, light – matter interaction, amongst others. A synthesis of national and international legal and safety regulations applicable to the use of high power laser systems should be included.
Specific requirements related to the laser technologies for the further development of a complete laser system and its integration into the sensor and weapon systems of current and future platforms should be identified and evaluated within the context of defining or refining concepts of employment and use.
A realistic breakdown of the development cost of the laser effector(s) should be presented.
An outline of the roadmap should be included in the proposals.
(b) Criticality mapping
The materials, components and technologies that need foremost priority support because of technological or economic bottlenecks need to be thoroughly assessed. Insufficient R&D capacity in the EU at the early stages of the development as well as lack of industrial capacity (including skills) towards the pre-manufacturing stages of the laser effector should be mapped. End-user restrictions imposed by non-EU countries should be identified.
Depending on the scenarios selected for the R&D assessment, the mapping should at least investigate the critical components or technologies that hamper technological progress in the following challenges:
Single-beam high power laser technology;
Laser architectures capable to deliver graduated responses for integration in different platforms, including novel beam combining technologies, like coherent beam combining, should be investigated;
Technologies for the wavefront management of the laser beam (including innovative adaptive optics) to correct in real time aberrations induced by atmospheric conditions;
Technologies and solutions for focusing and tracking the laser beam on the target,
thereby keeping in mind that those components or technologies should satisfy platform-integration constraints related to size, weight, volume and power. An initial version of the assessment and the critical materials/components/technologies mapping needs to be provided in the early stages of the project, to be updated by the end of the project.
A first identification of the main critical technological aspects should be included in the proposals.
Both the assessment, including the roadmap and the criticality mapping will form an integral part of the Special Report[2].
(c) R&T activities
Most of the proposed research efforts and the budget should be dedicated to initiate R&T activities in line with the proposed roadmap.
The consortium should therefore select to address one or more materials, components, laser design or technologies pertaining to the main critical technological aspects. The proposal should clearly demonstrate that R&T activities will generate by the end of the project results that can be taken up in the early stages of the development of the laser effector(s). To this end, at least one demonstrator is required in order to prove that the specific technology gap is filled and/or to prove the potential of the technology for future power increase (scalable laser power capability).
Involving European end-users in order to obtain realistic specifications for the envisaged scenarios would be considered an asset. Proposals should include a high level description of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the envisaged functionalities and the methodologies on how to measure them. A report with a detailed description of these KPIs and methodologies should be delivered within 6 months after the start of the project.
When relevant, results publicly available from EDA and NATO activities and studies should be taken into account for the proposed work. The activities included in the proposals should clearly differentiate from or go beyond work already covered under relevant themes of the EU Research and Innovation Framework Programmes[3].
The implementation of this topic is intended to target TRL 5.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Union between EUR 4 000 000 and 5 400 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
Convincing demonstration of the potential of EU-funded research in support of EU critical defence technologies, in particular in the domain of high power laser effectors;
Establish a R&D assessment including a technology roadmap towards an EU High Power Laser Effector by 2027 with milestones and estimated budget needs;
Ensure secure and autonomous availability of high power laser effectors to military end-users by 2027;
Contribute to strengthening the European industry and help improve its global position through the implementation of innovative technologies along a new European manufacturing value chain.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Soldier equipment will increasingly have to meet and adapt to the requirements stemming from their future application in multinational, less and less predictable and very dynamic environments This introduces important challenges to soldier systems, such as:
Interoperability of defence systems will be a key capability in the future. For Land Defence Systems, interoperability of vehicles, infrastructures and soldier systems will be based on open standards and joint architectures. This introduces important challenges to soldier systems, such as multi-national interoperability, effectiveness, adaptability to mission and mission intensity, maintaining equipment at state of the art, life cycle cost efficiency, logistic and human resource footprint of force protection.
The safety of military personnel is a critical element of effective defence and security. The defensive measures as individual ballistic protection remain vital. The current ballistic protection systems for the soldiers are mainly based on the fibre technology and hard materials technology, where high-performance fibres and hard materials (and their combinations) are manufactured into 2D and 3D assemblies to retard the ballistic threat. New solutions and materials like shearthickening fluids are being implemented into body armour production, but still not in a commercialisation phase. Despite the efforts in the research area (most of them outside the EU), the shortcomings of commercially available products exist. The main disadvantage of the commercially available ballistic systems is their weight – average weight to area ratio for level IIIA (according to the NIJ Standard) remains about 6 kg/m2, for level III is approximately 20 kg/m2, for IIIA+ is close to 30 kg/m2, and for level IV about 42 kg/m2. The inflexibility and design shortcomings to differences in anatomy and protection approaches based only against kinetic energy threats are also important challenges. In this respect, blast protection needs to take into account the use of CBRN agents together with ammunition, explosives or IEDs and the need to detect and protect soldiers from such elements.
A strong civilian driving force encourages research and development in order to adapt visible appearance. Materials and components exist or are being developed to change the visual appearance of a surface for e.g. display applications. These are, in general, not suited for defence applications. Present and future threats from advanced sensor systems have been analysed. Advanced materials and structures for high-resolution spectral design are developed at universities and industry without knowledge of defence specific requirements. For longer (invisible) wavelengths no such civilian demand exists. Adaptive materials, structures and components in short wave infrared, thermal infrared and radar require specific research. Such adaptive technologies must be compatible with defence specific requirements on endurance and operability.
Scope:
The topic calls for proposals to explore and demonstrate the potential of how technology can further advance and enhance soldier systems beyond current programmes, hence assessing what is the state-of-the-art in one or more of the aforementioned areas. Proposed activities could cover one of the following sub-topics:
(a) Generic open soldier systems architecture
The proposals should propose a definition of architecture ready for standardisation and comprehensively covering soldier systems within their context of operation (group, squad, multi-national, vehicles, etc.). The architecture domain to be considered shall include:
electronics;
voice and data communication;
software;
human interface devices;
sensors;
effectors.
The architecture shall be based on a suitable architectural framework. At the end of the project a technical validation should be performed to ensure that a proposed architecture in terms of interfaces, protocols or standards is technically feasible and to enable delivery of an open, modular and easily reconfigurable soldier system.
Results from relevant NATO (STANAG 4677, STANAG 4619, STANAG 4695, STANAG 4740) and EDA (STASS I & STASS II) activities and studies should be used as baseline for the development of generic open soldier system reference architecture.
(b) Tailor-made blast, ballistic and CBRN protection of military personnel
The proposals should aim at research and technology development in lightweight ballistic and blasting protection allowing reduction at least 20% of weight versus existing commercial solutions for military personnel. The technology should allow achieving optimized protection with effective dissipation of energy and body protected zones. It should enable flexibility and modularity. Proposals should also explore the use of novel materials to integrate CBRN detection and/or protection into military body armour. Relevant advancements in manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing, might also be investigated.
The activities included in proposals submitted under this sub-topic should clearly differentiate from or go beyond work already covered under Horizon 2020, in particular by the Specific Challenge ""Secure societies – Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens"".
(c) Adaptive camouflage
Advanced active and passive camouflage methods which are able to rapidly reconfigure or change to various patterns according to the surrounding environment. The camouflage should be active against a variety of present and future threats from advanced sensor systems and observation means, adapted to the needs and the variety of missions of the military users.
Activities are expected to focus on TRL 2 to 3 (for subtopic (a)) and TRL 2- to 4-5 (for subtopics (b) and (c))
The European Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 to 1.5 million for subtopic (a) and EUR 2 to 3 million for subtopics (b) and (c) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Convincing demonstration of EU-wide research cooperation in defence research;
Promotion of the integration of interoperability standards;
Enhancement of the effectiveness of military personnel;
Reduction in life cycle costs."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Human and animal health worldwide is increasingly threatened by potential epidemics caused by existing, new and emerging infectious diseases (including from antimicrobial resistant pathogens), placing a burden on health and veterinary systems, reducing consumer confidence in food, and negatively affecting trade, food chain sustainability and food security.
 The increasing incidence and more rapid spread of such diseases are facilitated by modern demographic, environmental, technological, economic and societal conditions. Many of these infections are zoonoses, necessitating an integrated, cross-border, ‘one health’ approach to research and public health measures in the human and veterinary field, including the food chain.
 Scope: Sequence based data of pathogens should be generated, stored and analysed in combination with clinical, microbiological, epidemiological, additional gene- and transcriptome-based analyses and other data (e.g.: differing  responses in women and men) for risk assessment (RA) in an appropriate information system for all sectors (public health, food, animal health).
 Proposals should improve pathogen monitoring by rapid identification, comparison, and geographical mapping, including bio-tracing approaches. Proposals should include predictive models on RA, to identify ‘high-risk’ areas and disease-emergence patterns. Proposals should ensure links and consistency with existing networks and databases (TESSY, RASFF, EWRS, EFSA/ECDC[1] molecular testing database) and data protection requirements. Access to the system should be granted to relevant animal, food safety and human health service stakeholders.
 Harmonised standards for sampling, sequencing, sex-disaggregated representative (meta-) data collection, management and sharing should be developed. Likewise, better management tools for authorities, businesses and citizens and risk communication tools for authorities should be developed. The cost effectiveness of the tools and methods should be assessed. Better understanding of outbreaks in regions with little or no surveillance systems, mass migration settings or post-disaster settings may require special attention for emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Proposals should cooperate with existing EU projects and international activities and those under development.
 The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 and 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact: This should provide:
Better containment and mitigation of epidemics by competent authorities on the basis of a shared information system and global standards for rapid pathogen identification.
Consequent improved resource efficiency and reduction of economic impact of outbreaks (related to health care costs, market losses); facilitation of international trade, increasing competitiveness of European food and agricultural sector; reinforcement of food chain sustainability and enhancement of food security, reduced carbon footprint.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation[2] in research and innovation, proposals should contribute to implementing the ‘Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness’ and its objectives.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Vaccines offer a safe and cost-effective way to protect large populations against infectious diseases, or at least to mitigate the clinical course of these diseases. Yet many poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases continue to escape attempts to develop effective vaccines against them.
Disappointing results of recent clinical trials point to bottlenecks in identifying viable candidate vaccines, which if unaddressed will continue to present significant risks of failure at relatively late stages of the development process.
The specific challenge will be to shift this ‘risk curve’ in order better to select successful vaccine candidates (and discard those with a higher risk of failure) at an earlier stage of the vaccine development process.
Scope: Proposals should focus on strengthening the capacity for discovery and early development of new vaccine candidates for tuberculosis by addressing all of the following inter-related elements:
1. Establishment of a platform for the identification of several new diverse and novel vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, and their pre-clinical and early clinical testing.
2. The major bottlenecks in vaccine development should be addressed; in particular better ways for early distinction between successful candidates and those that will eventually fail in late stage clinical trials. Proposals should therefore address areas such as in vitro and in silico testing, predictive animal models, predictive correlates of protection, phase 0 trials, first in man trials and innovative risk prediction methods, taking into account potential sex-specific differences. Based on specific gating and priority setting criteria the most promising new vaccine candidates for tuberculosis should be compared with other candidates and selected in an objective and transparent process according to their merits in line with effective vaccine portfolio management.
3. The successful proposal shall be part of the Global TB Vaccine Partnership and continue its vaccine development in the context of this initiative in collaboration with the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), and a pathway and commitment towards this must form an integral part of the proposal.
In line with the Union’s strategy on international cooperation[1] in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. The proposals should also address the barriers and possible facilitators regarding the uptake and implementation of a new vaccine in low, middle and high income countries in different regions of the world.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 and 25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: This should provide:
Reduction in the cost associated with late stage vaccine failure, increasing the number of other candidates which can be tested with the same resources, thus increasing the chance of discovery of an effective vaccine
Contribution to the implementation of  the Global TB Vaccine Partnership for the development of tuberculosis vaccines and, (currently under development in collaboration with European Investment Bank and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) including the establishment of close links with the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP).

Specific challenge: Vaccines offer a safe and cost-effective way to protect large populations against infectious diseases, or at least to mitigate the clinical course of these diseases.

The specific challenge will be to shift this ‘risk curve’ in order to better select successful vaccine candidates (and discard those with a higher risk of failure) at an earlier stage of the vaccine development process, for preventive as well as therapeutic vaccines.

1. Establishment of a platform for the discovery and selection of several new diverse and novel preventive or therapeutic vaccine candidates for HIV/AIDS, and their pre-clinical and early clinical testing.
2. The major bottlenecks in vaccine development should be addressed; in particular better ways for early distinction between successful candidates and those that will eventually fail in late stage clinical trials. Proposals should therefore pool expertise in the areas of in vitro and in silico testing, predictive animal models, predictive correlates of protection, phase 0 trials, first in man trials and innovative risk prediction methods, taking into account sex-specific differences.

","SME instrument phase 2
","03 March 2014
","17 December 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Biomarkers are used in clinical practice to describe both normal and pathological conditions. They can also have a prognostic or a predictive power. They are therefore increasingly used in medicine and many potential biomarkers are proposed every year.
Only a few of them are however validated for use in a clinical research setting. Such validation implies the demonstration of a link to a pertinent clinical endpoint or process, as well as a robust and appropriate analytical method.
The clinical validation of biomarkers will be increasingly important for the development of new diagnostics, and this is a research area where many small European companies are active.
Improved clinical decisions should lead to better health outcomes while contributing to the sustainability of the health care system.
Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants may apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
Proposals submitted to phase 1 shall consist of a draft business plan and feasibility study verifying the technological/practical and economic viability of the clinical validation proposed. These may, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, intellectual property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept etc. Proposals may analyse bottlenecks preventing advance of the applicant SME in this area and identify how a phase 2 proposal may contribute to attaining growth or sustainability.
The main outcome of the proposal should be a detailed business plan. Funding for phase 1 will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000 and proposals should have a duration of around 6 months.
In phase 2 proposals should address the specific challenge described, elaborated in the scope section above, and demonstrate high potential in terms of applicant's competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan.
Proposals shall be based on a business plan developed either through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants should provide evidence of the possibility of commercial exploitation (‘freedom to operate’).
The clinical validation of existing potential biomarkers (not the identification of new ones) is sought. This validation should provide evidence for: high analytical validity; appropriate sensitivity and specificity; clinical validity/ utility. Preference will be given to validation of biomarkers with high potential for short term uptake into clinical practice.
In addition, validation of the clinical performance of new diagnostic devices can be supported, either in combination with the biomarker validation, or against existing standards.
Both in vivo and in vitro potential biomarkers are eligible. Preference will be given to the validation of disease related biomarkers (i.e. diagnostic, susceptibility/risk, monitoring and prognostic biomarkers)
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that phase 2 proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Phase two projects should duly justify their duration making reference to obtaining patient samples, ensuring patient follow up, etc.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) and provided by a dedicated coach through consultation to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a database managed by the Commission and on the basis of their business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the EEN will complement coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation services. This may include, for example, depending on the needs of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact: This should provide:
         Increased clinical availability and exploitation of biomarkers for the benefit of the patient.
         New diagnostic devices.
         Facilitation of entry of improved diagnostics in the clinic and the market.
         Support for the implementation of the Commission proposal for a revised in vitro diagnostic devices regulation[1].
         Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.

These may, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, intellectual property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept etc. Proposals may analyse bottlenecks preventing advance of the applicant SME in this area and identify how a phase 2 proposal may contribute to attaining growth or sustainability.
The main outcome of the proposal should be a detailed business plan. Funding for phase 1 will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000 and proposals should have a duration of around 6 months.
In phase 2 proposals should address the specific challenge described, elaborated in the scope section above, and demonstrate high potential in terms of applicant's competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan.
Proposals shall be based on a business plan developed either through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants should provide evidence of the possibility of commercial exploitation (‘freedom to operate’).
The clinical validation of existing potential biomarkers (not the identification of new ones) is sought. This validation should provide evidence for: high analytical validity; appropriate sensitivity and specificity; clinical validity/ utility. Preference will be given to validation of biomarkers with high potential for short term uptake into clinical practice.
In addition, validation of the clinical performance of new diagnostic devices can be supported, either in combination with the biomarker validation, or against existing standards.
Both in vivo and in vitro potential biomarkers are eligible. Preference will be given to the validation of disease related biomarkers (i.e. diagnostic, susceptibility/risk, monitoring and prognostic biomarkers)
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that phase 2 proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Phase two projects should duly justify their duration making reference to obtaining patient samples, ensuring patient follow up, etc.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) and provided by a dedicated coach through consultation to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a database managed by the Commission and on the basis of their business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the EEN will complement coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation services. This may include, for example, depending on the needs of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact: This should provide:
Increased clinical availability and exploitation of biomarkers for the benefit of the patient.
New diagnostic devices.
Facilitation of entry of improved diagnostics in the clinic and the market.
Support for the implementation of the Commission proposal for a revised in vitro diagnostic devices regulation[1].
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Contribution to the sustainability of health care systems.
Increased likelihood of market uptake and distribution of resulting innovations tackling the abovementioned specific challenge(s) in a sustainable way.
Leveraging of private investment in clinical validation as described above, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
Type of action: SME instrument (100% funding)
While all other instances of the use of the SME instrument in Horizon 2020 provide for reimbursement at 70%, the predominance of research type activities in clinical validation necessitate reimbursement at 100% in this case.

","04 May 2017","Specific Challenge:
Nanostructured coatings or nanotextured surfaces provide improved scratch and abrasion resistance, super hardness and mechanical resistance that rivals diamond in performance, improved wear resistance and corrosion inhibition, bio-compatibility, control of reflectivity, sensing ability, self-cleaning surfaces improving many products such as technical textiles and papers, structural elements for machinery, construction elements, transportation, etc.
Nano-enhanced functional surfaces have huge potential in different sectors, including packaging, marine, water treatment, electronics, building and construction, automotive, transport, energy and other applications including textile, leather and industrial engineering.
The involved technologies to manufacture these surfaces or coatings are currently at a lower TRL level, and call for up-scaling, demonstration and validation in large scale pilot installations in operational environments, before industrial manufacturing can take place.
Scope:
The proposed pilot lines should address the development, upscaling and demonstration in relevant industrial environments of reliable manufacturing processes to obtain nanostructured surfaces with mechanically enhanced properties.
They should use existing pilot lines as a starting point for development, incorporating new materials and methods and/or instrumentation with real time characterization for measurement, analysis and monitoring at the nanoscale to characterise relevant materials process properties;
The aim is to increase the level of robustness and repeatability of such industrial processes; to optimise and evaluate the increased performances of the production lines in terms of productivity and cost-effectiveness; and finally to assess the functionality and performance of the new materials/products.
Proposals should address the complete research-development-innovation cycle and obstacles remaining for industrial application, and involve a number of relevant materials producers and users, also considering the needs of SMEs.
Technology transfer should be prepared through technology services at affordable costs, facilitating the collaborating with EU SME and large industries, and the rapid deployment and commercialisation of the new technology.
Examples of possible developments include:
Upgrade existing production methods, extending current production capabilities of mass production injection moulding, or additive technologies such as Roll-2-Roll- and sheet-2-sheet printing, into the sub-100 nm regime.
Enhancing key properties of promising lab scale nano-enabled surfaces and upscale their production up to pilot level. Different technologies for nano-enabled surface production may be considered.
Applying such surfaces in sectors (more than one is preferred) where they may have strong social and economic impact.
Non-technological aspects key for the marketing of such products (e.g. standardization, regulatory issues, user acceptance, HSE aspects, LCA) need to be considered.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6, and target Technology Readiness Level 7. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The action is expected to lead to a direct economic impact on the economy of the manufacturing industry as well as society, resulting from issues such as increased performance and durability of wear-intensive industrial components, reduction of infrastructure maintenance costs, and reduction of operational costs due to energy savings.
Functional nanotextured surfaces and nano structured coatings have a huge potential for many sectors, and embedded nanostructured functionalities in coatings and surfaces can alleviate problems from ice, pollutant, UV, fire, heat, marine life, wear, friction and corrosion. These factors cost global industry billions in maintenance, loss and downtime each year. For example, direct corrosion costs account for 3-4% of a country’s GDP worldwide. The same for wear costs. Energy losses due to friction in mechanical contacts reaches more than 10% of the GDP of a developed country. More sustainable production as well as products can also be expected, including an environmental impact, from using eco-friendly nanocoatings instead of traditional lubricants for example.
Integration of state-of-the-art nanotechnology in the traditional production of coatings or surfaces will give a market advantage and enhance the competitiveness of European industry.
The new functionalities achieved will have important impact on many sectors, including packaging, marine, water treatment, electronics, building and construction, automotive, energy, textile, leather and industrial engineering.
Enhanced manufacturing capacities in Europe and/or enhanced market opportunities for European enterprises. These impacts should be addressed in particular in the outline of the business case and exploitation strategy to be submitted with the proposal. The expected content of this outline is further detailed in the LEIT introduction, section 6.
The impact should be presented at three levels:
Impact on the consortium materials producers and users, and other involved industries, demonstrated in the form of reduced costs and full consideration of environmental and safety legislation.
Other existing or new materials manufacturers, describing the expected impact from further integration of the nano-enabled multifunctional materials into practical large-scale applications with producers outside the consortium,
Global impact in form of direct or derived benefits from competitive advantage of the new materials and products.
The impact will also be improved by a contribution to training and knowledge dissemination for building an educated workforce.

","24 May 2016","Specific Challenge:
Infections by pathogenic microorganisms adhering on various surfaces kill worldwide more people than any other single cause.
These diseases are of particular significance in hospitals (surfaces/furniture, medical devices/implants, surgery equipment, health care products and hygienic applications) as well as in water purification systems, textiles, food packaging and storage, domestic appliances, etc.
Alternatives to antibiotics to control infectious biofilms are required, due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. The increasing demand for superior quality medical devices and improved sanitation calls for the development of nano-enabled surfaces with antimicrobial functionality.
Nanotechnologies for water treatment units in industrial environments is another example where innovation is required in addressing environmental factors, decisive for industrial competitiveness.
Also food safety issues are of increasing public health concerns. Protection and preservation of food by using active and intelligent packaging materials is a promising route to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks and reduce food waste caused due to early spoilage.
Addressing these challenges calls for the industrial upscaling of manufacturing processed for generation of nanostructured and/or functionalised antimicrobial surfaces and biomaterials having anti-biofilm activity, and eventually including smart sensing and environment dependent functionalities. Technologies that are affordable and industrially robust are required. This should ensure the further integration of the nano-enabled multifunctional materials into practical large-scale applications, and drastically exceed the current use.
Scope:
The proposed pilot lines should address the development, upscaling and demonstration in relevant industrial environments of reliable materials and manufacturing processes to obtain nanostructured surfaces with antimicrobial, biocompatible, anti-adhesive properties.
They should use existing pilot lines as a starting point for development, incorporating new materials and methods and/or instrumentation with real time characterization for measurement, analysis and monitoring at the nanoscale to characterise relevant materials, process properties and product features.
The aim is to increase the level of antimicrobial effectiveness, robustness and repeatability of such industrial processes; to optimise and evaluate the increased performance of production lines in terms of productivity and cost-effectiveness; and finally to assess the functionality and performance of the new materials/products.
Proposals should address the complete research-development-innovation cycle and obstacles remaining for industrial application, and involve a number of relevant materials producers and users, also considering the needs of SMEs.
Specific aims of the proposed actions could be
The fabrication of new antimicrobial surfaces, or the improvement of existing ones via the application of surface coatings, or the modification of the surface architecture, in order to eliminate or substantially reduce the extent of bacterial attachment on these surfaces are foreseen. A multi-functional approach should be followed for the development/modification of the nanostructured surfaces ((i.e. prevention of adhesion combined with killing of microorganisms and evt. combined with smart sensing functionalities)
Technology transfer should be prepared through technology services at affordable costs, facilitating the collaborating with EU SME and large industries, and the rapid deployment and commercialisation of the new technology, including for example industries or municipalities located in deserted zones or islands etc.

Expected Impact:
Societal challenges in the healthcare, water and food processing fields are addressed. Medical and healthcare are obvious markets, but it is also expected to see contributions to solving other social challenges such as sustainable solutions for availability of clean water or improving on food safety.
Improved hygiene in hospital environments and prevention of cross-infections will show economic and social benefits of scale, resulting from such reduced needs for treatment of infectious diseases acquired during hospitalization.
Adding anti-microbial, anti-adhesion functionalities to water treatment equipment or food packaging is another potential area where benefits can be derived from reduced operational costs and increased water or food quality.
The aim is to facilitate the manufacturing and use of these surfaces and their production, and establish process control and characterization approaches for an industrial production. Direct benefit to the involved industries should be demonstrated in the form of reduced costs and full consideration of environmental and safety legislation.

On the other hand, paper is ubiquitous in everyday life and it is one of the cheapest materials in our society. It is renewable, portable, flexible and in addition cellulose, its main component, is the Earth’s major biopolymer and has an essential economic importance in Europe, which is responsible for 30% of the world’s total production. Paper Electronics represents a new concept which combines the use of paper as a functional part of electronic components or devices. Typical applications include packaging, graphics, novel diagnostic systems and hygiene products for indicating product safety or freshness, support logistics, health-care and safety for example.
Paper-based electronics shows promising technical, economic, and environmental advantages which will allow new recyclable electronics devices like paper displays, smart labels, smart packaging, bio-and medical applications, PoC devices, RFID tags, disposable electrochemical sensors among others. Paper-based electronics represents a promising source of innovation and growth for sectors such as packaging industry which develops smart solutions able to interact with the end users or classic paper publishing industry which are facing challenges from electronic books and journals, healthcare industry which intensify the development of quantitative biosensing, microfluidic and lab-on-chip devices.
Scope:
The proposal should address the physical, chemical and engineering challenges linked with the use of paper as substrate as well as active components of the electronic devices: it includes the development on new technologies for paper manufacturing (fiber enhancement, porosity, fillers, etc) and converting, new paper coatings (organic, inorganic or hybrid), paper surface characteristics and functionalization (nanocellulose functionalization, plasma or gas treatments, bio and chemical modifications for instance) but also heterogeneous integration of high-added value electronic components on paper and introduction of new materials (conductors, semiconductors, insulators, electrochromic, batteries electrodes). The proposal should develop high-precision, cost efficient, and high output printing or other manufacturing technologies on large area (inkjet, screen printing amongst others, and sheet-to-sheet or roll-to-roll processes). The proposal should also address recyclability and eco-design aspects.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 3 and target TRL 5.

Priorities of the year, objectives pursued and expected results:
This action aims to support activities in view of the development of community-based care models to improve health care access of vulnerable migrants and refugees. Through facilitating the transition from institutional to community-based care and integrated services, it aims to identify innovative ways of reducing inequalities in access to health services, and promote social inclusion through supporting access to social, community/home-care, cultural or recreational services. Community-based health clinics (hubs) offer an opportunity to create health-promoting places. These care models can also support reorientation of specialists to general practitioners, to strengthen healthcare in primary care settings. This action will deal with compiled best practices in care provision for vulnerable migrants and refugees (including pregnant women, children and older persons), with a focus on psycho-social aspects, acute and chronic diseases, including communicable diseases.
Description of the activities to be funded under a call for proposals:
The activities to be carried out may cover:
(i) review existing evidence and carry out a survey to collect information on the physical and mental health status of vulnerable migrants, including the related health and social service needs, with a view to provide evidence base for integrated, holistic and community based care approaches. Specific needs of vulnerable sub-groups should also be explored;
(ii) review existing approaches and identify best practices and tools of community-based health care models across the EU and beyond, serving vulnerable migrants. Special attention should be paid to the effectiveness of these models in terms of health (physical and psychological) promotion, communicable and chronic diseases prevention and care. Approaches relevant for the most vulnerable sub-groups (e.g., children, pregnant women and older persons) should also be explored, including integrated services for families;
(iii) map the legal, organizational and institutional environment across the EU, access existing capacity and feasibility of introducing integrated, community-based approaches;
(iv) pilot test and evaluate comparative models for the provision of health care for vulnerable migrants across a selection of EU Member States, including the economic analysis of comparative practices; and
(v) create a competence network on mental health –specially post-traumatic stress- of migrants and refugees, involving experts from Member States, in close collaboration with health ministries, non-governmental and health professionals’ organisations, and vulnerable migrants, with the aim of developing materials and recommendations on mental health care and medical documentation in intercultural refugee populations; organize training of health and social professionals to detect mental disorders and provide first psychological aid in refugees; and to identify efficient pathways for longer-term care programmes that could include social activities and peer support in refugee populations to prevent the onset of mental disorders; identifying ways to advise refugees on access to mental health care.

Deadline date","Scope:
This action aims to communicate the potential of health promotion and disease prevention and health determinants in the Member States and to increase the commitment of public authorities to this topic. A workshop (and a conference) to update knowledge and good practice will be organised, with the participation of the main medical faculties and the Chief Medical Officers of all Member States. The workshop will be preceded by the preparation of a report providing an overview of the current situation in the EU (this document will be updated after the workshop) and it will be followed by a conference.
Lifestyle determinants are behind most chronic diseases. They have a major impact on the health of European citizens – from before birth to old age –, on the burden on health systems, and on the productivity of our societies.
For most people, reliable information about their health will be provided on a regular basis by health professionals. Ensuring that health professionals, especially General Practitioners, have the adequate knowledge on healthy lifestyles, and the skills and experience to promote them, is thus essential to support citizens when taking decisions and making adjustments in their daily life.
Such changes can have major positive effects on health over the entire span of the life of each person. They can avoid that healthy citizens become (chronic) patients. Health professionals should have access to the best evidence base and to the training opportunities necessary to support the prevention and treatment of lifestyle-related chronic diseases.
This is made more relevant by the fact that health professionals generally have very limited time with their patients, and the patients are usually and naturally most interested in a pressing health problem. This creates a constant pressure to focus the contact or consultation on symptoms and treatment. In parallel, proposing lifestyle changes is in many cases not fully accepted by patient and doctor alike as a complete treatment option.
By encouraging universities, education regulators and professional associations to include the knowledge about (promotion of) healthy lifestyles throughout the lifespan as part of the curriculum, these subjects can be better mainstreamed in basic medical training, reaching all health professionals and becoming (more) practiced and accepted. This can be achieved during the studies to obtain a medical diploma or through courses, workshops or additional training after graduation.
To address these questions, it will be important to map how EU health professionals are being trained in health promotion and to create a EU network of medical faculties, education regulators and professional associations to promote interest, capacity building and engagement in this area; to organize a workshop to develop concrete action; and to further promote the topic and publicize the developed initiatives in an international conference."

Background and purpose of the call:
The European health workforce is facing major challenges due to an ageing population, a higher demand of new primary care models and better-integrated and more patient-centred care, and rise of chronic diseases, in a broader context of persistent budgetary constraints. Moreover, the health workforce itself is ageing rapidly while financial cutbacks compound broader migration patterns and are causing severe health workforce shortages in various Member States. Finally, several EU regions are facing the problem of so-called “medical deserts” with falling number of medical practitioners. It becomes more than urgent to promote evidence-based reforms to address the challenges that the European health workforce is facing, through actions focusing on retention policies, medical deserts and task shifting.
Targeted beneficiaries: Legally established organisations, public authorities, healthcare providers, health professional associations, public sector bodies (in particular, research and health institutions, universities and higher education establishments in Member States and other participating countries).
Objectives pursued and expected results of the initiative:
The objective of the initiative is to provide support to Member States to design and implement their policies related to healthcare workforce retention, task-shifting and regional medical deserts. This should be achievedthrough the development of supporting tools –guidelines, scaling up of good practices, creating a platform for policy dialogue to advance on these challenging issues.
The initiatives aim specifically at:
Identifying and analyzing factors related to the conception and implementation of reforms on retention policies, medical deserts and task-shifting, and developing practical guidelines for the public authorities and healthcare providers which will serve as operational tools supporting their healthcare workforce policies in relation to challenges in these fields;
Analyzing and suggesting possible changes in the legal and policy environment and ways to provide incentives to remove legal and other barriers to the recruitment and retention of healthcare workforce in underserved areas;
Implementing effective strategies, identifying best practices and facilitating the exchange of these practices including at regional or local level (e.g. through information sessions), assessing the suitability/ground for broader practice dissemination;
Contributing to a network on health workforce linked to the EU health policy platform (EU-HPP)[1], to ensure the sustainability of results achieved under individual projects ,continuation of dissemination and scale up of best practices amongst Member States beyond the action's term;
Organizing workshops and seminars to ensure joint reflection among the actors participating in the selected initiatives and relevant experts and, when relevant, cross-fertilisation of ideas across the three areas of reforms at stake;
Enhancing knowledge, including by targeted studies and reports related to the development of retention policies, the development of policies on medical deserts, and the implementation of task-shifting projects;
Providing practical training and developing educational material, which could be further exploited by public authorities and healthcare providers engaged in the health workforce field;
Organising events to present the lessons learnt and the guidelines to the relevant public authorities and healthcare providers.
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic:
The action will finance Initiatives on medical deserts carried out by public authorities.
Activities to be carried out under such an initiative may include, but are not limited to:
Definition and taxonomy of the concept of medical desserts taking into account relevant distinguishing factors such as demand side (demographic ageing), supply side (attracting and retaining health work force), progress in take-up of e-health solutions, established mapping of “medical deserts” if available (reported) and providing a set of tools with “diagnostic” metrics;
Feasibility of measurement framework: how to identify and monitor medical desserts, including through considering use of available data, and how to apply it in the national and subnational context taking into account various healthcare delivery models;
Root cause analysis of factors driving “desertification” per Member State taking into account subnational specificities and ways for optimisation of territorial coverage of health workers;
Consensus-building exercise on optimal mix of policy measures, also explicitly addressing possible trade-offs (e.g. between quality-of-care and patient traveling distance).
Updated figures and forecast of health workforce shortages as well as their impact on the health systems
Possible approaches to mitigate medical deserts that could be brought by an adequate skill-mix or the use of e-health or IT systems
All proposed actions should take into account, complement and build upon available data/actions, in order to bring added-value and avoid duplications.
The allocation of resources within the consortium shall focus on the implementation of initiatives in the partner organizations. Organizations in the consortium shall explain their role and their specific contribution to the project in line with the text and requirements of the call.
The proposals shall include a methodology for impartially evaluating the progress made on implementing proposed initiatives throughout the duration of the project.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Integrated care seeks to improve patient experience, outcomes of care and effectiveness of health systems (known as ""triple aim"") through linkage or coordination of services and providers along the continuum of care. Integrated care is multidimensional. For patients with chronic conditions in particular, integrated care aims at improving or maintaining an individual's functional status, prolonging life and enhancing its quality by reducing discomfort caused by symptoms. To do this successfully, healthcare must overcome its fragmentation and also link actively with social cases.
The action proposed under Call B is a vehicle to support care authorities with reforms and modernisations of their health and care systems. The proposed action will aim at
Assisting care authorities to develop the necessary capacity to implement integrated care. It will build on tools, guidance and knowledge from earlier work in the EIP AHA, EU projects and the EU HSPA expert group.
Bringing together “early adopters/pioneers” in integrated care in Europe with “followers/green field” care authorities that are keen to make the transition to integrated care.
Delivering “technical assistance” to the latter type of authorities on:
""what to consider"" when embarking on the planning and design of integrated care,
""how to design"" effective integrated care programmes,
“how to transfer” good practices from early adopters/pioneers.
In more concrete terms, this may concern how to proceed with putting in place the essential design principles and building blocks for integrated care that were identified by the EU HSPA group and implement:
new care models that place emphasis on empowering patients, delivering care at home and community settings, and incorporating prevention strategies to preserve the well-being and functional capacity of patients;
relevant organisational changes (such as joining-up budgets from health and social care; training the healthcare workforce in new skills and roles; organising multi-disciplinary care teams of GPs, nurses, specialists and social care workers; and contracting approaches between purchasers and providers of care services);
risk stratification tools to focus interventions on people with the highest need;
integrated patient pathways to realise a continuum across health and social care;
appropriate use of ICT (eHealth and telemedicine) to facilitate the delivery of care services outside hospitals; and
tools/frameworks for assessing the quality and effectiveness of integrated care."

The target groups for this topic are aproved ERNs not yet receiving grants for registries.
Background and purpose of the call:
The proposed action aims to support the development of rare disease (RD) registries for the European Reference Networks (ERNs).
Patient registries and databases constitute key instruments to develop clinical research in the field of rare diseases, to improve patient care and healthcare planning. They are the best way of pooling data to achieve a sufficient sample size for epidemiological and/or clinical research. Registries serve as a recruitment tool for the launch of studies focusing on disease etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis or therapy.
The Council of the European Union recommended[1] that, in the field of rare diseases, Member States consider supporting at all appropriate levels, including the EU level, for epidemiological purposes, registries and databases, whilst being aware of independent governance. In order to support this process and, in particular, the interoperability of data in rare diseases registries, the Commission decided to set up a European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform[2]) and to develop specific standards for the interoperability of such rare disease registries (“JRC standards” developed by the Commission's Joint Research Centre).
As foreseen in Article 12 of the Directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare[3], 24 European Reference Networks (ERNs) were kicked-off in 2017 and since 2018 they are developing their research capabilities. Patient registries belong to this development, enabling to build patients cohorts at European level to follow up the natural course of diseases with sufficient patients data.
Five ERNs already received financial support from the Health Programme (Annual Work Plan 2016) and are currently developing a comprehensive approach for rare disease registries covering their entire ERN, following JRC standards and tools.
The remaining 19 ERNs are preparing their strategy in terms of research and registries and need to be financially supported, too.
As laid down in the Directive, research in general and registries in particular are one of the objectives of the ERNs[4]. Since five ERNs are already supported for this purpose, only approved ERNs not yet receiving grants for registries are eligible to be co-funded through the present call.
Objectives pursued and expected results:
The main objectives of the present Call for projects for RD registries for ERNs are:
- to enable building, upgrading, linking and making interoperable registries covering the diseases and conditions of each ERN, thus linking and making visible patients cohorts at European level in order to follow up the natural course of diseases with sufficient patients data, also by registering all individual RD registries of the ERNs on the EU RD Platform;
- based on the above registration, to develop a comprehensive approach for rare disease registries covering the respective ERNs following the standards and tools provided by the EU RD Platform.
Patient registries will also contribute to the ERNs evaluation process foreseen in the ERN implementing decision and to the continuous monitoring and quality improvement system of the networks.
Proposals for upgrading already established registries are acceptable, as long as the proposal is in line with the objectives and registry policy of the specific ERN and covering the diseases and conditions of that ERN. The Coordinator or the Board of the ERN should approve the proposal and nominate the healthcare provider (a member of the ERN) to be responsible to carry out the action on its behalf and coordinate the project to be implemented with partners, in particular other members of the same ERN.
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic:
The activities to be carried out concern the building and development of rare disease patient registries for ERNs and further development and quality-control of existing registries.
In doing so, the following principles should be followed:
(i) strengthen coordination and cooperation and develop synergies among the networks and their registries;
(ii) build on existing tools and avoid doubling similar actions or activities;
(iiI) avoid the development of a variety of diverse, non-interoperable solutions.
Registries should, in particular, be built using the infrastructure and following the standards of the EU RD Platform and provide it with all the necessary data, and comply with the relevant data protection rules. For developing the registries, the ERNs commit to ensure, as a first step, that all individual registries used by the respective ERNs are registered on the EU RD Platform and in particular on its “European Rare Disease Registry Infrastructure” (ERDRI) that renders rare disease registries' data searchable and findable. Thus, the proposals to be funded will have to work with JRC, making sure that all ERNs will benefit from harmonised tools and standards following coordinated efforts around the EU RD Platform.
The projects must end with fully operational, interoperable and visible registries. The co-funded projects shall use JRC common data elements and shall be enrolled in the EU RD Platform / ERDRI. These registries should acknowledge the link with their ERNs.
Cooperation with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) can also be envisaged, but there are no specific requirements on how the ERN registries projects should cooperate with EMA.
The Clinical Patient Management System (CPMS), the online tool currently used for the clinical work of the ERNs, shall also be considered in this context if it serves the specific needs of the ERNs. Thus, if the consortium so wishes, an interaction with the ERN IT Advisory Group and/or with DG SANTE IT specialists for information and advice can be foreseen.
In addition, the ERN Research Working Group (formed of ERN representatives and of representatives of the ERN Board of Member States) can also play a facilitating role to create synergies for the registries developed for ERNs.
Expected output and impact:
The expected outputs are:
Setting up new or improving the existing rare disease registries;
Better coordination and cooperation among rare disease registries;
Increased interoperability between rare disease registries;
Cost-effective building of registries by avoiding fragmentation and duplication of work;
Better visibility of rare disease registries and, in particular, of those used and enhanced by ERNs.

Illicit drug use is a major problem for individuals, families and communities. There is an increasing trend of polydrug use, including licit substances like alcohol and illicit substances. In addition, there is an increase in new psychoactive substances. Young adults are especially at risk. The aim of this action is to prevent and delay the age of onset of illicit drug use. It should generate and promote new and innovative good practices of prevention measures (in particular measures aimed at preventing polydrug use and use of new psychoactive substances), thus supporting the EU Action Plan on Drugs and the implementation of the minimum quality standard in drug demand reduction.
Description of the activities to be funded under a call for proposals
The activities should aim at testing methods/tools and at identifying good practices on preventing illicit drug use and delay onset of use. A particular focus should be given to prevention measures aimed at young adults to prevent polydrug use including alcohol and the use of new psychoactive substances. The measures considered should address risk factors such as age, gender and cultural and social factors, drug use in night life settings and work place and driving under influence. In addition, prevention measures in settings such as prisons might be included. The focus of activities should be aimed at selective preventions targeting vulnerable groups (in particular lower socio economic groups) The internet and its role in distribution and as knowledge base should be taken into account."

Background and purpose of the call:
Health stakeholders face challenges when it comes to planning, accessing and blending financing to respond to their health systems’ needs. Most health authorities are used to receiving direct funding from government budgets and EU grants; and do not possess sufficient skills for configuring investment strategies and plans. There is an evident need to improve the health sector's capacity to prepare investment plans, consolidate multi-source financing and use alternative financial instruments (such as loans, equity and payment-by-results schemes) for this purpose.
The call responds to recommendations of a recent study on health investments[1], which was commissioned by the European Investment Bank and the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (and financed by the European Investment Advisory Hub), in particular, the recommendations concerning strategic planning and technical assistance for investments.
Objectives pursued and expected results:
Objectives:
To identify the health-related investments planned under Cohesion Policy Funds in the programming period 2021-2027
To develop a methodology and a toolkit to map health needs and existing health system assets (infrastructure and human resources) in the EU countries, which Member States can then apply to prepare health investment strategies, linked also to the use of Cohesion Policy Funds
To raise awareness, develop educational material, provide training (via the ‘train the trainers’ principle) and, ultimately, improve the capacity of health stakeholders to use financial instruments, consolidate multi-source financing and prepare investment plans and ""investable"" project propositions
To organise thematic and geographic workshops (minimum 30) and events to: disseminate the methodology, toolkit and educational material developed under Objectives 2 and 3; promote co-operation and mutual learning between Member States; and provide training for the purposes of Objectives 2 and 3, tailored to national context and processes
Expected Results:
Catalogue of health-related investments planned in the Cohesion Policy Funds Operational Programmes in the programming period 2021-2027
Methodology and Toolkit (both available online) to map health needs and existing health system assets (infrastructure and human resources)
Collection of good practices based on case studies showing how to: develop health investments strategies and operationalise them with investment plans, use European Funds in these plans; access financing from alternative sources; and use innovative financing schemes (such as social outcomes contracting)
Educational material (curriculum) on how to access financing, use and combine financial instruments and prepare investment plans and ""investable"" project proposals. This may take various formats of course material, which should all be available online, including e-learning modules to ensure broad dissemination of knowledge
Report on thematic workshops combined with training courses on all the above, reaching all Member States and key stakeholders
Report on the piloting of training materials in at least four regions in four Member States before the workshops
Translated training material to all EU languages for national and regional authorities
A database of at least 50 investment experts who can provide advice and technical assistance to stakeholders of health systems
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic:
This action shall concern three strands of activities:
Provide an overview of envisaged investments in health-related areas planned for implementation in the programming period 2021-2027 with the support of Cohesion Policy Funds
Provide support to Member States with the identification of health needs and mapping of available health system assets (infrastructure and human resources), which can then form the basis for strategic investment planning
Raise awareness and capacity of stakeholders[2] in the health sector on how to access financing, use and combine financial instruments, and prepare investment plans and projects
Expected impact:
The Action will produce materials that do not currently exist. The results shall make available best practices, methodologies, tools and training material that can be used by any Member State or region. Collectively, the activities and deliverables of the action will address an unmet need and a gap in the capacity of the health sector to prepare investments in health, as raised repeatedly by stakeholders (e.g. in the seminar ""Strategic investments for the future of healthcare"" organised by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety[3] and in the report of the High-Level Task Force on Boosting Investment in Social Infrastructure in Europe[4]).

Priorities of the year, objectives pursued and expected results
The objective of this action is to identify and address key elements with a potential to reduce the burden of major chronic diseases and increase the sustainability of health systems. It should provide new evidence on economic and efficient means to achieve better health outcomes and to alleviate the burden on health and social systems if implemented at an appropriate scale in Member States. Proposed initiatives should generate impact when implemented, be transferable to other settings and elaborate incentives for implementation. They should have the potential to become relevant elements of national chronic disease strategies and add up to an integrated response to chronic diseases. Initiatives should help to reduce avoidable costs and burden for patients and health care systems.This action will complement the action on chronic diseases referred to under 2.2.1.2 (see Annual Work Programme 2016.
Description of the activities to be funded under a call for proposals
Activities should concentrate on following areas:
1) Identify, develop and put into practice evidence based measures to prevent and manage chronic diseases with a focus on: (i) early detection of major diseases and adequate timely intervention with a focus on inter-sectoral and cross cutting interventions; (ii) identification of needs and opportunities for disease prevention and targeted intervention for most vulnerable groups; (iii) effective means to facilitate access and retain chronic disease patients in the labour market and their home environment; (iv) enhancement of community care for better chronic disease prevention and management; (v) elements for more effective management of multi-morbidity; (vi) identification or development and implementation of integrated patient and care pathways; and (vii) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) for best interventions;
2) Strengthen the evidence base for a response to prevent and manage chronic diseases through improved health information and health intelligence by: (i) expanding data for monitoring and assessment of policies and health related actions; and (ii) improving the health literacy through better access and availability of health related information for most vulnerable groups."

Background and purpose of the call:
Mental health problems affect about 84 million people across the EU. This is more than one in every six citizens. The total costs of mental ill-health are estimated at more than 4% of GDP (more than EUR 600 billion) across the 27 EU Member States. Out of this, EUR 190 billion reflects direct spending on health care, EUR 170 billion is spent on social security programmes, and EUR 240 billion represents indirect costs to the labour market due to lower employment and productivity. In a dedicated chapter, the Health at A Glance: Europe 2018 report[1] stressed the need to improve and promote mental health, concluding, inter alia, that mental ill-health leads to lives lived less fully and to lives lost prematurely.
The Commission has undertaken and supported many actions on mental health over the past fifteen years. Taking the European Framework for Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing[2] (as the main outcome document of the EU Joint Action on Mental Health and Well-Being[3]) forward, the Commission created the EU Compass for Mental Health[4] to support implementation resulting in -for instance- good practice exchange and capacity building. The Compass' practices were since incorporated in DG SANTE’s 'Best Practice Portal'[5]. The Commission wishes to support the Member States in building on the expertise gathered and on the progress made over those years. Contributing for decision makers in Member States to have the most up to date knowledge on best practices is relevant to better support national health systems and EU citizens. Supporting the awareness, commitment and roll-out of initiatives that have shown to work is an essential way of creating and delivering value to the citizens.
Whereas a best practice cannot be replicated without adaptation and adjustment, the results, experience of ongoing and past initiatives always constitute a wealth of relevant knowledge. Considering them may allow to avoid mistakes or to leap frog painful development steps; ignoring them may result in huge wastes of time and resources, and of opportunities to improve public health.
The Steering Group on Promotion and Prevention and Management of Non-Communicable Diseases (SGPP) is the central mechanism to support Member States' health objectives, especially via implementation of best-in-class approaches. Late 2018, the Steering Group set mental health as a priority for the identification of best practices and implementable research[6]. Consequently, a selection of practices resulting from projects funded by the EU Health Programme or Horizon 2020 was show-cased to Member States’ representatives at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra in May 2019[7]. By autumn 2019, Member States ranked these according to relevance to their national priorities and interest for implementation in their national settings.
Objectives pursued and expected results::
Through this call for proposals, the Commission now seeks to support the roll-out of those practices with the highest priority ranking and that require a strong involvement of non-governmental actors, notably:
European Alliance Against Depression[8] - iFightDepression
Housing First[9] Portugal (Casas Primeiro Portugal)
Actions under this topic shall transfer the best practice IFightDepression : It is a 4-level intervention programme aiming at improving care for patients suffering from depression and preventing suicidal behavior. It comprises several simultaneous intervention activities, which have been shown to generate synergistic effects - cooperation with primary and mental health care, focusing on training general practitioners; public awareness campaigns; cooperation with community facilitators and stakeholders; support for people at high risk, and their relatives.
It focuses on action programs, campaigns, e-mental health, mental health in all policies, policy work, research, service delivery approaches, tools/instruments, and training.
Originated in Germany, the practice has been implemented since 2004, also in several other countries. Various aspects have been evaluated since, indicating the programme’s effectiveness in reducing suicides and improving the care of people suffering from depression.
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic:
Actions funded under this topic shall transfer the above best practice to other Member States and embed it in their health systems. Actions shall include, among others:
assess the preparedness of local, regional, national entities and health services in the participating countries for introducing the above mental health best practice;
increase the awareness of the importance of mental health among policy-makers and health professionals;
develop, translate and provide high quality implementation tools for implementing above best practice;
train trainers and professionals in the core components of the best practice (adapted to the national context);
implement local, regional or national activities for contextualized practice transfer;
monitor the implementation process and assess the outcome of the implementation;
design measures to assess and increase the sustainability of the practice after the implementation phase;
develop opportunities and supportive networks for capacity building between the participating countries and the EU.
Promote the implementation to other EU Member States that are not participating in the project.
Actions such as feasibility assessments or studies, legal checks, need assessments (including training), cost estimations, preparation of replication manuals (including translations where necessary), definition of clinical protocols, setting up of e-learning tools, study visits and twinning, workshops with stakeholders, etc., should furthermore be included.
The proposals shall describe and justify which indicators will be used to measure outcome and to monitor the implementation of the action and measure the success of transferring the best practice. To complement the task of monitoring and evaluation, the selected proposal will be provided with the forthcoming OECD guide to support the monitoring of the implementation of best practices in general and the design of indicators in particular. The OECD may also provide specific advice to this action on how to optimise the cost-effectiveness of the best practice and an economic analysis of its results.
The projects funded under this topic are expected to liaise with the forthcoming Joint Action on Implementation of Best Practices on mental health of the work programme for 2020 of the Health Program, which will allow Member States’ health authorities to transfer further validated practices of high policy relevance.
The proposals are expected to build on the outcomes of the previous EU-funded work on mental health as well as on lessons learned on the transnational transfer of good practices, for instance via the Joint Action CHRODIS Plus[10] and other projects funded via the Health Programme that focus on good practice transfer[11].
This call for proposals shall involve entities, namely NGOs, that are responsible for development, stewardship and implementation of (mental) health practices on the ground, in direct contact with the citizens, also with regard to prevention. They can and should also involve national and regional health authorities when relevant.
Expected impact:
Activities under this call for proposals shall successfully transfer the above best practice to other Member States in a sustainable manner. In doing so, the actions contribute to:
supporting Members States in constantly improving the quality and sustainability of their health systems, especially through to improving information, expertise and the exchange of best practices [12], also building on the European Pillar of Social Rights[13];
supporting Member States in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 on reducing mortality caused by non-communicable diseases by 2030 through prevention and treatment including the promotion of mental health and well-being[14];
the invitation to Member States and the Commission ‘to implement evidence-based and effective policy interventions at national and Union level to address common challenges to wellbeing, in accordance with their respective competences’ as included in the Council Conclusions on the Economy of Wellbeing (adopted in October 2019)[15]. These Conclusions drew attention to the necessity of promoting good mental health and advancing prevention, early diagnosis, treatment and de-stigmatisation of mental disorders;
the European Parliament Resolution on employment and social policies in the Euro area (October 2019)[16], which called on the Commission and the Member States to develop specific measures to follow up on the European Framework for Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing and the EU-Compass for Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing;
supporting Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, by addressing one of the determinants associated to disease (citizens with mental health problems being more vulnerable) and one of its consequences (being diagnosed with cancer has an impact on mental health);
the EU action to improve health at work and social rights, and collaboration between the health and social areas.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This action aims to build a common assessment methodology to allow academics, health professionals and authorities to assess and verify safety, quality and efficacy of (new) transplantation therapies and/or other type of clinical applications of human tissues and cells (e.g. assisted reproductive technologies). An increasing number of discussions in the area of substances of human origin (SoHO), especially in the tissue and cell transplantation sector showed that there is an acute need to improve the common understanding of safety, quality and efficacy issues. These relate not only to processes and techniques for the preparation of tissues and cells, but also to their clinical application. In addition to the safety of the donated material, appropriate methodologies/tools for establishing the relation between the quality of tissues/cells and the efficacy of a specific application are needed. This improved and shared understanding is important for an optimal use of a limited resource such as human tissues and cells. Therefore, in the context of a fast-paced technological progress, developing appropriate methodologies/tools for ensuring high quality, safety and efficacy standards for the tissues and cells for clinical application is of utmost importance.
Scope:
The activities should develop a framework for assessing and verifying the quality, safety and efficacy of therapies with human tissues and cells. They should include criteria, parameters and methodologies for evaluation. An important focus will be on implementation, i.e. how these parameters and methodologies can be used by clinical actors in their daily practice to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of the tissues/cells clinical applications. The activities should include testing and validation of the proposed framework through prospective and/or retrospective studies. They should include measures to ensure that such a framework can be made available to and shared amongst the clinical actors in the field. They should consult all interested stakeholders, including professional societies and Member States competent authorities in order to ensure the acceptability of the proposed framework at all levels.
To the extent possible/necessary this action should also cover blood and blood components.

Priorities of the year, objectives pursued and expected results
The priority for this action is to increase the safety of donation and clinical application of tissues and cells and/or blood by optimising the procedures for donor selection and protection. While EU legislation defines the donor selection criteria in general terms, standardised procedures for gathering the necessary donor information are not developed at EU level. This is a high priority for these sectors because the success of transplantation, assisted reproduction and transfusion programmes relies heavily on achieving robust procedures for both the selection and protection of donors.
The objectives are: (i) to explore existing practices for the selection and protection of donors, including the gathering of donor medical and behavioural history, with particular emphasis on the design of effective questions for donors or their families, and (ii) to reach agreement on best practice for donor selection and protection procedures and questionnaires and develop tools to support its implementation.
This action should result in the development of common EU guidance on the selection and protection of donors and model questionnaires for use when interviewing prospective donors and/or donor families. The questions should be tested and validated to demonstrate that they are effective in terms of eliciting the information required for the application of exclusion criteria as defined in the EU legislation.
Description of the activities to be funded under a call for proposals
This action will bring together individuals and organisations from the tissues and cells and/or blood sectors with donor-facing expertise in those fields (e.g. physicians, key donation personnel from hospital to authority level) to address the following activities: (i) collect and compare EU and national donor selection and protection criteria based on a thorough evaluation of risks for donors and recipients; (ii) identify the information needed from donors or their families to allow the application of appropriate donor deferral or exclusion criteria for the protection of recipients; and (iii) propose approaches to control and minimize these risks, particularly by developing, testing and validating procedures that should gather complex and often sensitive information through an easily understood series of questions taking into account socio-economic, cultural and emotional factors. These approaches should include guidelines for screening donors, a proposal for a standardised donor and donor family questionnaire and proposals for short and long-term care and follow-up of living donors.
This action should build on previous EU-funded projects across the area of substances of human origin, in particular in organ donation/transplantation (e.g. DOMAINE, ELIPSY, ELPAT, and ACCORD). Involvement of relevant professional associations and competent authorities is strongly encouraged."

Deadline date","Scope:
Non-communicable chronic diseases have a major impact on the health of European citizens on the burden on health systems, and on the productivity of our societies. Contributing for decision makers in Member States to have the most up to date knowledge on best practices related to the reduction of such burden is thus most relevant to better support national health systems and EU citizens. Supporting the awareness, commitment and roll-out of initiatives that have shown to work is an essential way of creating and delivering value to the citizens.
Whereas a best practice cannot be replicated without adaptation and adjustment, the results, experience of ongoing and past initiatives always constitute a wealth of relevant knowledge. Taking them into consideration may allow to avoid mistakes or to leap frog painful development steps; ignoring them may result in huge wastes of time and resources, and of opportunities to improve public health.
Public health authorities should have access to the best scientific evidence base and to the expert evaluation of tried practices whenever considering disease prevention and management options. They should also have the opportunity to be briefed directly by those that have successfully led (past) initiatives and discuss, among others, pitfalls and success factors. Finally, they should be supported in the key steps of preparation of implementation so as to increase scope and likelihood of success.
Building on such information and support, and considering their national context and political priorities, Member States can then be in a better position to proceed with wide scale implementation of validated best practices and interventions. The stronger the commitment and the wider the roll-out, the more promising the results for the patients and citizens will be.
In order to support this process of promoting that more tested solutions benefit the citizen as fast and wide as possible, the Commission has set up the Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non Communicable Diseases This Group selects best practices for transfer between countries with the support of the 3rd Health Programme and other sources.
In this context, the SGPP has recently selected two relevant best practices for transfer from the ""owner"" to other Member States/countries participating in the 3rd Health Programme. These are the Swedish Prescription of Physical Activity (PPA) initiative which was identified as a particularly valuable one and has been replicated in Iceland already as well as the Italian cardiovascular screening programme ""CARDIO 50""
Several Member States have already expressed interest in discussing the rolling out of thses practices and the Commission wishes to further support this process.
For that purpose, this call for proposals is being launched and should facilitate the transfer of the two selected best practices to other countries.
Topic 1 - Transferring the Swedish Physical Activity on Prescription Initiative to other countries
The proposals should describe how the concept of PPA will be deployed in the participating Member States, including how the responsible authorities (those that can implement PPA at the level of the health systems) will be involved and their commitment secured with the objective of achieving the sustainable widest possible roll-out of the practice by the end of the action. It is suggested that the project has a time span of up to 3 years.
Among others, the proposals should describe how actions will be taken to:
assess the preparedness and feasibility of (local, regional, national) health services in selected countries for introducing PPA;
increase the awareness of the importance of physical activity as a measure for prevention and treatment of disease among policy-makers and health professionals;
develop, translate and provide high quality implementation tools for PPA;
train trainers and professionals in the core components of the Swedish PPA methodology (adapted to the national context);
implement local, regional or national activities for contextualized practice transfer;
monitor the implementation process and assess the outcome of the implementation of PPA;
design measures to assess and increase the sustainability of PPA after the implementation phase;
develop opportunities and supportive networks for capacity building between the participating countries and the EU.
Actions such as feasibility assessments or studies, legal checks, needs assessment (including training), cost estimations, preparation of replication manuals (including translations where necessary), definition of clinical protocols, design of e-prescription modules, setting up of e-learning tools, study visits and twinning, workshops with stakeholders, etc., would be expected.
Unless duly justified, it is expected that the public health authorities of at least the following countries will be involved: Sweden, Iceland, Romania, Lithuania and Portugal, and also Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Denmark, France, Italy, Malta, and Slovenia.
The proposals should describe and justify which indicators will be used to measure outcome (e.g.: patients' level of physical activity a few months after being prescribed physical activity) and to monitor the implementation of the action and measure the success of transferring the best practice (e.g. first prescription is achieved; number of medical professionals trained; translation and validation of guidelines and tools; number of PPAs per 1000 people; number of follow-ups; number of lifestyle counselling incorporated in the curriculum of doctors and other professionals). To complement the task of monitoring and evaluation, the selected proposal will be provided with an OECD guide to support the monitoring of the implementation of best practices in general and the design of indicators in particular. The OECD may also provide specific advice to this action on how to optimise the cost-effectiveness of the best practice and an economic analysis of its results."

Rare 2030 is a two-year project, led by a research team, but using inclusive methods to promote a focus on EU added value.
A continuous bottom-up approach will be used so as to put more emphasis on interaction and to encourage a broad take-up by patients, stakeholders and society at large of approaches developed at EU level.
The purpose of the pilot project is to propose sustainable policy scenarios in the field of rare diseases for the period 2020-2030 and to address challenges and opportunities up until 2030 in a comprehensive and innovative manner, with particular emphasis on limited competences at EU level.
The methodological steps and timeline for Rare 2030 will include different work packages:
base research, including literature reviews and exploratory interviews to identify drivers of change and current and future challenges; - establishment of an expert / multi-stakeholder panel;
consensus building methods will be used to define the main drivers (political, scientific, etc.) for scenario building and will be open to large groups of stakeholders on a European level;
an interdisciplinary and forward-looking workshop for scenario building will be used as a tool to reveal available choices and their potential consequences; the scenarios developed will take into account resources at EU level, and include options to use the existing structures better, in particular the framework of the European Reference Networks (ERN) and the Steering Group on Promotion and Prevention (SGPP).
EU added value will be defined in options for action at EU level, both as theoretical concept and in terms of practical scenarios, with a clear distinction from actions recommended at national level.
extended patient consultation (survey) on the identified scenarios;
a European ‘consensus conference’ (‘conférence de citoyens’) to present, discuss and review results, engaging society to shape and take ownership of the outcomes;
identification of sustainable options for future action, bringing together the results of the scenarios and conference;
a final report, in English, outlining the options for future action and outcomes of the project and measuring its impact; the executive summary of the report will be translated into various EU languages;

","06 May 2021
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The Covid-19 crisis resulted in one of the greatest challenges education and training systems have faced in the last decades. Many schools, particularly those located in remote areas, faced severe challenges with the switch to distance and online learning, due to their low prior level of digital readiness. Many of their teachers lacked the relevant digital competences to properly teach remotely and many pupils living in remote areas lacked the proper infrastructure including connectivity and access to digital devices, tools and content at home.
Therefore, the loss of learning opportunities strongly impacted especially those that have already suffered a disadvantage before the crisis (e.g. pupils such as those living in remote areas like mountain areas, rural areas, islands or deltas, etc.).
This calls for reinforced actions to ensure inclusion is a leading priority in education and training, granting the right to education for all.
Objective:
This action aims at addressing inequalities of access to digital education by enhancing inclusion and by reducing the digital gap suffered by pupils from remote areas and communities with low connectivity, limited or no access to devices and digital educational tools and content.
This action aims at developing a strategy designed to increase access to digital education in the EU remote areas and communities that mostly need such support.
The action will also run deployment actions in primary, secondary and vocational schools in order to implement and test some of the most suitable technical solutions to reduce the digital gap suffered by pupils from remote areas and communities. These deployment actions will be accompanied by targeted educational consultation and training services for schools and teachers.
Expected impact:
The action is expected to produce the following results:
To gain insights and understanding related to the access and use of, and attitudes and needs towards the use of digital technologies in education by surveying head teachers, teachers, ICT coordinators, pupils and parents covering as many schools located in remote areas of as many EU Member States as possible. This should be done by collecting comprehensive and high-value up-to-date and reusable data to mainly explore lessons learned during and after the Covid-19 pandemic well as to empirically validate the areas of necessary investment needs;
To strengthen the dialogue between all relevant actors, including school principals, teachers, ICT coordinators, pupils, parents, technology providers, policy-makers, universities and research organisations, experts and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with the aim to exchange and analyse best practices and successful applications of how to increase access to digital educational solutions with a focus on schools located in remote areas.
To support schools with targeted educational consultation and training services ahead and during the take-up of deployment pilots (see next bullet point). The services are designed to support schools located in remote areas with aspects of self-evaluation (e.g. using the SELFIE self-reflection tool for schools) and school improvement in order to successfully plan, choose and implement the best digital technology solutions for the inclusivity of their pupils.
To run deployment pilots to allow primary, secondary and vocational schools to benefit from the most suitable technical solutions to reduce the digital gap suffered by pupils from areas and communities with low connectivity, limited or no access to devices and digital educational tools and content. This will be done through a financial support to third parties (FSTP) mechanism applying a fair and transparent selection process via open calls. At least 50% of the budget is expected to be dedicated to financial support to third parties (FSTP) and the maximum amount of FSTP, distributed through a grant, is EUR 20.000 per third party for the entire action duration but smaller amounts may also be justified.
To accompany the deployment pilots by running training programmes to enhance teachers’ digital competences regarding the use of the newly implemented digital devices and digital educational tools and content as well as regarding the development of innovative pedagogies.
To develop a strategy based on the insight gained by the collected data, the various dialogues with stakeholders and running the deployment pilots, with regard to how to increase access to digital education in remote areas and communities with low connectivity, limited or no access to devices and digital educational tools and content throughout the EU. The strategy should result in the publication of ready-to-use guidelines and standards.
The action should reach a large number of EU Member States and as many EU primary, secondary and vocational schools located in different types of remote areas as possible."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The objective of the proposed pilot project is to demonstrate an interoperable technical infrastructure dedicated to the implementation of child protection mechanisms (such as age verification) and parental consent mechanisms based on relevant EU legislation such as the Audio Visual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Technical measures will be based on the use of electronic identification (eID) means (in particular, electronic identification schemes notified by Member States under the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation)).
The AVMSD requires Member States to ensure that video-sharing platform providers take measures to protect minors when using their services. Such measures include age verification systems for users of video-sharing platforms with respect to content that may impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors (Article 28b.3(f)).
The GDPR specifies the age as of which children may consent to processing in relation to information society services (Article 8(1)). When the child is below the specified age, the GDPR requires controllers to make reasonable efforts to verify that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology (Article 8(2)).
Specific objectives:
The pilot project shall:
1) Undertake a large-scale mapping of existing methods of age-verification and obtaining parental consent in the context of online child protection. This mapping should cover methods used in EU Member States, but should also cover widely-used non-EU solutions, both open-source and propriety.
The mapping should result in a comprehensive overview of existing age verification and parental consent methods, and the different age limits they aim to target. The mapping should also identify relevant good practices, including those ensuring compliance with the AVMSD and the GDPR.
2) Based on an assessment of the mapping presented to the Commission, design, implement and test an interoperable infrastructure for child online protection including in particular age-verification and obtaining parental consent of users of video-sharing platforms or other similar online services, using different approaches, including for example eID. The infrastructure shall take into consideration the relevant articles of the AVMSD and be designed in a manner compliant with the GDPR and cover a minimum of 3 EU Member States/EEA countries.
The infrastructure shall test how it is possible to:
a) perform reliable age-verification checks, to protect or block children from accessing age-inappropriate content on video-sharing platforms or other media / online services that are potentially harmful for the child and to identify cases where the GDPR requirement for parental consent applies;
b) provide reliable consent mechanisms for the holders of parental responsibilities;
c) support the cross-border age-verification of users in a manner that is respectful of data protection principles and rules;
d) ensure children’s interests and wellbeing are at the heart of the infrastructure.
It may also provide links or other access options to content dedicated to children.
In the execution of the above tasks, the pilot project should involve relevant stakeholders in the authentication and validation supply chain and take into account the work of data protection authorities on the matter.
The age-verification infrastructure will make use, among other mechanisms, of electronic identification (eID) means deployed at national level in Member States, by relying on the birth date contained in the eID.
The infrastructure will also allow the cross-border exchange of age-verification information, so that an online content provider in one Member State can use eIDs issued in another Member State to verify the age of users, by integrating the eIDAS nodes deployed in Member States based on the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.
Expected impact:
The pilot project is expected to demonstrate an interoperable technical infrastructure for child protection, including age-verification and parental consent, which should support the implementation of the child protection mechanisms derived from the requirements in the AVMSD and the GDPR.

The European Commission adopted on 20 April 2020, a decision on the financing of pilot projects and preparatory actions in the field of ""Communications Networks, Content and Technology"" and on the adoption of the work programme for 2020[1].
Paediatric cancers are a collection of diverse rare diseases that together represent individually life- threatening diseases and collectively a major public health issue. With 35,000 new cases and more than 6,000 children and young people dying each year in Europe, paediatric cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease for children and adolescents. Moreover, there are more than 300,000 European childhood cancer survivors (nearly half a million by 2020). Two-thirds of survivors live with the long-term treatment-related side effects that can be severe and impact on the daily life of half of those affected.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in is an important enabler of advancements in the field of health and care: it can unlock data insights needed to support data-driven decisions for diagnostics and treatments. In particular, AI has the potential to carry out complex tasks that are currently performed by specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. In this sense, AI technologies have the potential to ease the burden on the health system and improve access to healthcare (e.g. screening) in remote or low resource areas. AI may also play a role in training healthcare professionals.
The effective implementation of machine-learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies can bring solutions to many societal challenges, including improved diagnostic and treatment pathways. Integrated healthcare and research data platforms that collate information on clinical phenotypes, diagnostic tests (including pathology, genomics, radiological imaging), treatment interventions and clinical outcomes will be powerful tools towards early and accurate diagnoses, enable precision in stratification of patient cohorts according to therapeutic needs and facilitate development of new therapeutic innovation.
The particularity of paediatric cancers being rare diseases necessitates a collaborative approach to collate and integrate the data collected in all Member States, including best practices and new technologies in order to further develop common solutions. The use of big data for better insights in cancer genesis, outcomes and the long-term side effects of treatments is currently under-developed. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are powerful tools allowing for complex data analytics on large-scale data sets with great potential for fostering precision cancer medicine for all young people in Europe.
Further advances in the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric oncology will require multi-national, multidisciplinary integrated healthcare and research data platforms that will allow real world data simulations of machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence that can be exploited in data-driven clinical decision support applications that directly benefit patients
Specific objectives
The project will support the development of multi-national approaches to facilitate capturing data on paediatric cancer from multiple sources, and build a multi-stakeholder network to explore the applications of Artificial Intelligence technologies in paediatric cancer.
The project will develop a state-of-the-art report to help understanding the challenges, needs and gaps in capturing data on paediatric cancer across the Union or the EEA countries, or both.
The project will develop a framework to find solutions and prioritise opportunities to bridge existing gaps with a multi-national, multi-disciplinary approach.
Mapping and building on existing multi-disciplinary and multi-national platforms/datasets and registries, the project will pave the road to a one-stop shop European point of access for integrated healthcare and research data platforms that collate clinical data, including, for example, clinical history, relevant diagnostic tests (pathology, genomics, radiological imaging), treatment interventions and clinical outcomes for childhood cancers.
The project will create a multi-stakeholder network to connect and facilitate the exchanges and dissemination of best practices in clinically relevant Machine-Learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies between all relevant stakeholders, including paediatric oncology, technology developers, and the European Reference Network for Paediatric Oncology (ERN PaedCan), and experiment on their application in relation to multi-national large-scale data sets.
The project should focus on multiple applications, for example radiological imaging, digital pathology, integrated genotyping and outcome prediction algorithms and clinical decision-making.
Expected Impact:
The project will support research and further collaboration on Artificial intelligence technologies applied for diagnosis and treatment of paediatric cancers. Project results are expected to cover a representative range of stakeholders and solutions across Union or the EEA countries, or both.
The project is expected to link to and collaborate with relevant Union initiatives (including the European Reference Network for Paediatric Oncology, ERN PaedCan) and build on Union-funded projects (for example, the Paediatric Rare Tumours Network – PARTNER project).

The goals of the project are as follows:
to develop a set of complementary measures and activities that would address the issues mentioned above and have concrete benefits for the maximum number of European ADOs and, more generally, the anti-doping system;
to allow ADOs to partner with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to conduct investigations, protect whistle-blowers and cooperate on joint investigations with law enforcement agencies and the global network of investigators;
to build capacity in the European anti-doping system, reduce the prevalence of doping in sport and maximise the health benefits generated by the practice of clean sport by European youths.
The project will be built on the following four pillars:
Assistance to develop a robust legislative framework that allows for the sharing of information between ADOs, law enforcement agencies and WADA and for the protection of whistle-blowers;
Assistance to develop the best mechanism (forums, conferences or online platforms) for sharing information on legislation and best practices on investigations, and on protecting whistle-blowers;
Assistance to build the investigative capacity of ADOs by providing training sessions to employees or hiring experts;
Assistance to allow ADOs to contribute to global networks of investigators.
The project will contribute in many ways to the objectives of the EU, including by:
protecting public health – doping is not just a problem affecting elite athletes and sport; but also, a threat to the society as a whole; especially youth. Research can attest a growth in the use of steroids and other prohibited substances by amateur athletes and youth to look and perform better.
providing new tools to combat the organized crime – selling doping substances is a ‘low risk – highly profitable activity’. Research demonstrate the involvement of organized crime in the manufacturing and trafficking of doping substance in sports along other illicit substances. Sharing of information between ADOs and law enforcement ADOs will help optimizing the fight against manufacturing and trafficking in doping substances.
improving sports governance in and outside Europe - this project will contribute to strengthening the governance of sport organizations and to share EU values with other partners through the involvement of non-EU countries in the implementation of the project."

Specific Challenge: Reducing the impact of collisions between active satellites and orbital debris is a challenge that needs to be addressed at multiple levels. In addition to SST which addresses surveyance and tracking to prevent collision other aspects must be considered: 
Prevention, avoid adding new debris to the already large debris population.
Mitigation, specifically de-orbiting solutions for satellites and launcher upper stages at the end of their operational life.
Protection, i.e. shielding satellites from impact of small debris.
Scope: To develop and test concepts and technologies needed for safe de-orbiting and disposal of space objects, including up to in-orbit demonstration as an option. Planned end-of-life de-orbiting or safe disposal of new satellites and launch vehicle’s upper stages as well as non-technical issues including legal issues should be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Innovative and cost effective solutions, allowing scalable system-design, for post-mission disposal of satellites and launcher upper stages which are in line with or exceed international and European guidelines and legal requirements.

","Research and Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: In order to conduct close approach missions to NEOs, or to undertake mitigating demonstrations, it will be necessary to have a number of specific technologies and instruments readily available to conduct missions to asteroids with very weak gravitational fields.
In parallel, it is fundamental to acquire in-depth information on the internal structure and other physical properties of NEOs, not only for the design of most impact mitigation missions, but also for the assessment of the consequences of an impact on Earth.
Scope: In the first type of action, research is to be conducted on technologies and instruments relevant to orbiting, hovering, and manoeuvring close to small asteroids with very weak gravity fields. Accurate guidance, navigation and control (GNC) of a high-velocity (> 10 km s-1) kinetic impactor spacecraft into a small NEO or for prolonged hovering around it, as well as orbit determination and monitoring (types of observation and precision) before, during, and after a mitigation attempt, require further technology development. The same applies to means for material sampling and collection, in-situ analysis and sample return to Earth, which are of relevance to physical characterisation.
In actions covering the second specific challenge, scientific research is needed to identify suitable objects for possible missions for detailed characterisation of properties and for developing demonstration and testing of deflection techniques. A characterisation of the NEO population, in particular the small NEOs (50 – 300 m) is to be undertaken. Typical mitigation-relevant physical properties of NEOs include sizes, albedos, mineralogy, shapes, densities, structures, porosities, frequency of binaries, frequency of rubble piles, etc.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: For the first type of action, proposals are expected to contribute to the development of essential techniques and instruments, which would allow approaching and navigating in close vicinity and on the surface of asteroids and comets. The proposals should aim at TRL 5-6 (Technology Readiness Level[1]) and are expected to address technologies needed for deflection as well as for sample return missions.
Proposals addressing the second specific challenge are expected to lead to a comprehensive characterisation of NEO properties, which is mandatory for any mitigation or deflection mission. Data is to be made available in an open repository, taking into account complementary with existing databases. The identification of suitable targets and their accessibility for exploratory missions or mitigation demonstration missions is expected. An analysis of possible future actions in European programmes such as Horizon 2020 and ESA actions is expected.

","19 December 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The objectives of this inducement prize are: to empower the EU water distribution market with solutions based on wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting technologies, designed for real-time monitoring of water management; and, to stimulate broader European efforts in developing solutions for this societal need.
Prizes will be awarded to working prototypes for wireless sensor networks based on energy harvesting technologies, designed to efficiently acquire, monitor, communicate and analyse information about water resources in natural or man-made environments.
The prize is open in terms of energy sources and parameters to be monitored, but proposed solutions should have a clear application and should be able to demonstrate positive impact as a result of implementation.
In the past years the R&D community together with their industrial partners and water utilities has identified a number of emerging issues for smart water monitoring.
Among the software issues the interoperability of systems, harmonisation of software development, processing algorithms and storage technologies that are capable to accommodate increasing amounts of data are the main challenges.
Among the hardware issues the main challenge is the increasing number of sensors that collect real-time and near real-time information and to its power supply. Energy harvesting technologies offer a promising solution, especially in cases where the hard-to-reach and risky location, the small size and the number of the devices required make traditional technologies impractical. Another significant challenge is in developing solutions that are able to optimise energy storage to last for the expected lifetime of the device.
Expected Impact:
It is expected to provide the EU water utilities (and/or the municipalities) with an ICT prototype for monitoring of water. The ICT prototype should be based on wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting technologies. Specifically, it is expected to stimulate the creation of an effective and scalable autonomous, zero-power wireless sensor network platform to monitor of water resources.
The prize is open in terms parameters to be monitored, but as a minimum, the proposed solution should enable the water utilities to monitor in real time the supply and demand of water resources, including leakage management.
The wireless sensor network should be based on energy-autonomous sensor nodes capable of acquiring, monitoring and eventually analysing and cooperatively communicating their data through the network to a main location.
Each energy-autonomous wireless sensor node should be composed of an energy harvesting unit to scavenge energy from the surrounding environment; a power management unit responsible for storing and regulating the voltage/current values required for either supplying the other units directly and/or charging a backup battery; wireless transmission unit to transmit this information to a central base station that operates as a central information node.
For the purpose of this prize, ‘energy harvesting technologies’ are defined as technologies capable of capturing energy from a system’s environment and converting it into usable electric power. In addition, it is expected to consider the circuitry required to store and manage the generated power.
The solution should be based on one, or an innovative combination, of sources of energy available for harvesting: light, radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation, thermal gradients, and motion, including fluid flow."

Deadline date","Scope:
  Specific challenge: Space weather services exist already today in Europe and in several countries outside the EU. New services are also being developed (e.g. in ESA’s SSA programme and in EU Seventh Framework Programme projects). Their goal is to observe and to predict a range of solar events that may impact the near Earth environment including orbiting satellites and ground based systems. Today, the services partly rely on ageing solar observational infrastructure, which may need to be upgraded or replaced by new space based observatories in the coming years. Data from existing and upcoming missions, as well as available GNSS  data,  will open the door for Europe to push ahead in its impressive track record in space weather in general and heliophysics research in particular.
The challenge is to harness the expected much richer and larger volumes of data to enable new and more sophisticated modelling of complex physical phenomena and their impact. This will necessitate new approaches to data processing and international cooperation in this domain.
Scope: Exploratory work studying new ideas for data analysis and modelling of space weather with a view to enhancing the performance of space weather prediction. Proposals can cover the full range of space weather phenomena from the solar cycle, flares and coronal mass ejections to the effects of the solar wind in the near-earth environment and the evolution in between.
Research into further improvement of existing models, their validation and the associated simulation tools in the context of international cooperation with leading space weather service providers and/or related to emerging European space weather services.
There is scope for cooperation with international partners with relevant expertise (also third States’ entities with or without EU funding).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals are expected to deliver new insights into the detailed processes that generate space weather.

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
This call aims to establish 4-year Framework Partnership Agreements with European networks whose statutory aims are to prevent and combat violence against children and/or women, and to protect victims of such violence. The annual operating grants to be signed on the basis of these Framework Partnership Agreements will enhance the capacities of these networks to contribute actively to the development and implementation of the EU policies in this area.
Equality between women and men is a founding principle of the European Union. The Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality (2016-2019)[1] reflects the Commission’s continued commitment to ending gender-based violence and identifies five priority areas, including ""Combating gender-based violence and protecting and supporting victims"". Violence against women is recognised by the European Commission as a cause and a consequence of gender inequalities, a form of discrimination and a violation of women's fundamental rights.
In November 2013, the Commission and the European External Action Services signalled their strong commitment to tackling FGM, by adopting a Communication on Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation[2], which defines concrete measures, with a strong focus on prevention and victim support.
In line with the European Commission's objectives in this field, activities to be implemented by these networks should focus on prevention of violence and improving victim support.
In the area of violence against women, networks should aim to:
encourage attitudinal and behavioural changes with regards to harmful practices, including female genital mutilation;
improve the level of perpetrator programmes and of tailored and specialised support services for female victims of violence, particularly addressing the vulnerabilities of specific groups of women;
build the capacity of professionals in contact with victims of all forms of violence against women, and enable multi-disciplinary cooperation and mutual learning.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will support networks whose practical activities contribute to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme and which will implement among others: analytical activities, training and capacity-building activities, mutual learning, cooperation, awareness-raising and dissemination activities with EU added value.
The annual operating grant to be provided based on these Framework Partnership Agreements will finance the expenditure linked to the activities of these networks, insofar as they are in line with the objectives of the Programme in the area concerned and with the annual priorities that may be established by the Commission. The costs of general administrative expenditure necessary for the running of these organisations may also be covered.

Deadline date","Scope:
NB: Selected projects will form part of the focused actions on violence against women that the Commission will implement in 2017. Selected projects may be expected to integrate visuals and messages developed by the Commission in this context. Project leaders should be ready to present or showcase their activities and results at events during this year or through the Commission's social media and press activities.
1.1. Priorities
The aim of the call is to contribute to the protection of and the support of victims of gender-based violence and the enforcement of legislation supporting such victims, as well as to the treatment of perpetrators of such violence. To ensure access to justice, protection and support, it aims to empower victims to report gender-based violence.
For the purpose of this call, gender-based violence is defined as violence directed against a person because of that person's gender (including gender identity/expression) or as violence that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately. Projects should target victims or potential victims of gender-based violence and/or perpetrators of gender-based violence. Victims of gender-based violence may include but are not limited to women and girls, refugees and migrants, people with disabilities, Roma, persons belonging to national, ethnic or religious minorities, LGBTI, elderly women, homeless women.
This call for proposals aims to contribute to the implementation of Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime; Directive 2011/99/EU on the European Protection Order; and/or Regulation 606/2013 on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters. The access to justice strand of the Justice Programme covers a broader range of victims' rights linked to the implementation of the Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime (hereinafter referred to as the ""Victims' Directive"") than this Daphne call.
Proposals shall complement the efforts of the EU in the area of support and rights of victims and combating gender-based violence. Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will cover one or more of the following activities:
Capacity building and training for professionals, in particular staff providing specialised support to victims of gender-based violence (e.g. through shelters and other forms of safe, accessible alternative accommodation, legal advice, medical and psychological counselling, helplines/hotlines, victim support organisations or other essential services for victims and their families) or providing treatment for perpetrators;
Capacity-building and training in relation to gender-specific and, if relevant, child-specific, issues, in particular for professionals (police, lawyers, teachers, medical practitioners, support and helpline staff, employers) who are first points of contact for victims of gender-based violence so that they can better meet the specific needs of vulnerable victims, including signalling the violence, and referring them to more specialist support services;
Specific support programmes targeting in particular some of the most vulnerable victims of gender-based violence who are refugees and migrants, people with disabilities, Roma, persons belonging to national, ethnic or religious minorities, LGBTI, elderly women, homeless women;
As regards support for victims of gender-based violence and perpetrator treatment: mutual learning, identification and exchange of good practices, development of working methods, including referral methods, which are transferable to other participating countries, as well as their practical implementation;
Awareness-raising activities, training and sharing of best practice among practitioners and/or support services about the rights of victims of gender-based violence and about the protection (including domestic protection orders and possible EU wide-extension on the basis of the Directive 2011/99/EU and Regulation 606/13) and support available, as well as about innovative protection methods (for example through the use of new technologies).
As regards Directive 2012/29/EU, projects should not assess the transposition of the Directive's provisions into national laws but concretely focus on how the Directive is applied in practice for victims of gender-based violence (for example: treatment of victims at the police stations and by other persons coming into contact with them, access to information about their rights and about the case, access to specialised support services, rights to protection according to individual needs).
As regards the instruments of mutual recognition of protection orders (Directive 2011/99/EU and Regulation EU 606/2013), focus will be given to initiatives (e.g. awareness raising, training and sharing of best practices) that contribute to ensuring that protection measures which are legally available in the Member States are applied and enforced in practice.
The proposed projects may allow for adaptations or customisation in line with the situation in individual countries, but the overall objectives and methods must be the same for all participating countries.
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impact on the lives of victims of gender-based violence and possible victims of violence. The main focus of the proposed projects should be on activities that directly improve the protection of victims of violence, the support for victims of violence, and/ or the enforcement of legislation supporting such victims in line with EU law, and serve to better integrate all agencies and components in existing systems.
The projects should be multi-agency and where service delivery involves government authorities or state agencies or other entities mandated by the government, they should include formal government/mandated entity engagement for each participating country in the form of (associate) partner declarations describing the involvement. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals.
The following types of activities will not be funded by the Commission:
- activities supporting individual political parties;
- provision of financial support to third parties;
- legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives;
- mapping of best practices or best practice guides/guidelines;
- the establishment of shelters or other infrastructure
- descriptive research reviews,
- compliance assessments on national transposition of EU law.
Although the continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives may be funded, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions. Proposals are expected to take an evidence-based approach and build on existing knowledge and research, referencing these in the proposal. The establishment of shelters or other infrastructure should not be the main aim of projects. The focus of projects should rather be on capacity-building or developing new mechanisms and methods, and the integration of system components thus ensuring sustainability after the end of projects.
Activities endorsing or reinforcing gender stereotypes or gender norms that are harmful, justify gender-based violence and contribute to victim-blaming will not be funded. Any messages, images, materials or training methods developed in the context of this call should be sensitive, challenge gender stereotypes (for instance, avoid representing women as passive victims and all men as perpetrators) and should in no way stigmatise victims or any specific group.
Child protection
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to. A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in ""Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them"" issued by Keeping Children Safe (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/files/rights_child/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en.pdf).
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate, as codified in Article 24 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. This means embedding the child’s right to express his or her views freely in all matters affecting the child as well as the child's right to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, in accordance with Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. As well as reinforcing and respecting the child's right to be heard throughout all project activities, where possible, and with the necessary safeguards in place, project design should include involve children who are service users. Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. This should go beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and assess how activities and the use of deliverables have led to attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group, e.g. relevant professionals know where to refer victims and collaborate more effectively, or perpetrators are less likely to re-offend. Whenever possible, evaluations should encompass evidence on changes in both attitudes and behaviours, as a change in attitudes might not necessarily lead to a change in behaviour. When gathering evidence on attitudes, the evaluator should reflect on the possible effects of social desirability (i.e. the possibility that respondents do not state a particular opinion if they know that this opinion is not socially accepted).
Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. It should provide reliable results on ""what works"" and ""what does not work"" (for further details please refer to ""Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers"", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion).
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons/professionals/victims reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by gender and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Applications should also include a clear dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results."

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
For the purpose of this call, gender-based violence is defined as violence directed against a person because of that person's gender (including gender identity/expression) or as violence that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately.
Priority 1. Preventing gender-based violence
The focus is on primary prevention of gender-based violence, i.e. changing social attitudes and behaviour, in order to end tolerance of all forms of violence, with actions including (but not limited to): education and awareness raising, training and practical activities to tackle prejudices and gender stereotypes, norms, attitudes and behaviours that encourage, condone or minimise violence. Prevention also include actions focusing on perpetrators, to prevent them from offending again. Actions may focus on developing empowerment and intervention programmes to equip women and men with the tools to call out and stand up to violence as bystanders, and to be role models in the fight against gender-based violence.
Under this priority applicants should apply behavioural insights and practical tools from behavioural sciences in their proposals in view of achieving changes in attitudes and behaviour. A step by step approach can be found below under the Applying behavioural insights heading.
Target groups should be clearly identified and access to them guaranteed either through the constitution of the partnership or by providing support letters.
Priority 2. Tackling online violence against women
The focus is on prevention and response to online violence against women, with actions including (but not limited to): awareness raising of the general public and/or target groups; information and support to (potential) victims to develop coping strategies and claim their rights; information and support to (potential) victims on flagging or reporting harmful content to IT platforms and/or law enforcement agencies; capacity-building for relevant professionals; prevention and treatment of other forms of gender-based violence (including domestic violence) with a cyber-dimension; and tackling prejudices and gender stereotypes and norms that encourage or condone online violence.
In particular, actions may focus on the development of tools for reporting, flagging and/or removal of harmful online violent content against women. Co-operation with and among national audio-visual regulatory bodies, non-governmental organisations, IT platforms, national authorities, equality bodies, and criminal justice systems is strongly encouraged.
Priority 3. Protecting and supporting children, young people and women who are victims and potential victims (including witnesses) of violence
Actions shall focus on early detection, protection and support services for (potential) victims/witnesses of violence, addressing their specific needs. Projects shall aim at fostering multi-disciplinary cooperation and strengthening capacity building for relevant professionals in contact with victims, including – but not limited to - law enforcement, justice system, victim support or social services, health care professionals, care professionals and educators.
Actions may include the design, implementation and facilitation of access to specialised support services aiming at helping victims and witnesses of violence to overcome trauma, mental health issues and psychological harm linked to their experience of violence. Actions can also specifically target children, young people and women in migration.
The target group shall be (non-exhaustive list): social service professionals, health and care professionals, teachers, people working with children and youth, law enforcement representatives, staff in reception centres, or in alternative care settings, staff in detention centres, judicial professionals, helplines and hotlines operators, psychologists and therapists working with children, families, children, young people and women. The proposals should be designed with a victim-based approach, taking into consideration their specific needs, in particular those of the most vulnerable groups, such as refugees and migrants, people with disabilities, Roma, persons belonging to national, ethnic or religious minorities, LGBTI, elderly women, homeless women.
This priority aims to contribute to the implementation of Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime; Directive 2011/99/EU on the European Protection Order; Regulation 606/2013 on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters; and/or the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention), particularly Chapters IV and V related to support and protection measures (including the provisions on child victims/witnesses).
Proposals shall complement the efforts of the EU in the area of support and rights of victims and combating gender-based violence. Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission.
Priority 4. Preventing, combating and responding to peer violence amongst children
Actions shall focus on preventing, combatting and responding to peer violence amongst children (committed by children on children). Actions shall focus on supporting victims, perpetrators and/or witnesses of violence, as well as helping parents, professionals in schools, in youth organisations and clubs, in the health and care sectors, etc. to be better equipped to detect and respond to this phenomenon. Actions shall focus on all forms of violence, including online.
2. Description of the activities
Activities shall include:
awareness-raising and empowerment activities;
capacity-building and training for professionals;
design and implementation of protocols, development of working methods and tools;
design, implementation and facilitation of access to specialised support services;
exchange of good practices, mutual learning.
3. Expected results

(early signs of) violence is detected and reported, in particular increased reporting of violence to the police and other services, with appropriate mechanisms in place to facilitate this;
victims' safety is guaranteed and further violence prevented;
increased likelihood of bystander intervention;
increased capacity of stakeholders and relevant professionals to address issues related to gender-based violence, including through strengthened multi-agency co-operation and tackling of prejudices, gender stereotypes and norms.
Priority 2. Tackling online violence against women
changed attitudes and behaviour as regards the issue of illegal online content targeting women and girls among the general population and particular groups, e.g. relevant professionals, witnesses and bystanders, vulnerable groups;
online violence is prevented before it happens through education about respect and equality;
increased capacity of stakeholders and relevant professionals to address issues related to illegal online content, including through strengthened multi-agency cooperation;
online violence victims' safety is guaranteed and further violence prevented;
increased reporting of violence to the police and other services, with appropriate mechanisms in place to facilitate this.
Priority 3. Protecting and supporting children, young people and women who are victims (including witnesses) of violence
strengthened support and protection systems for children, young people and women victims or witness of violence – including access to specialised services;
increased awareness among groups at risk, relevant professionals and the general public;
increased capacity of relevant professionals in contact with those affected to address problems deriving from violence (such as mental health issues), in particular increased multi-disciplinary and multi-agency cooperation.
Priority 4. Preventing, combating and responding to peer violence among children
families, education, health and social services sectors are supported to detect, deal with and respond to episodes of violence among children;
capacity-building in preventing and responding to this phenomenon is increased for relevant professionals;
children who are victims, witnesses or perpetrators are empowered to recognise violence, speak about it and report it;
awareness is raised as regards the issue of violence among children;
national child protection systems are strengthened.
Practical projects developing and implementing concrete measures are preferred. While research is not excluded, if some research activities are to be part of the project, they shall be strictly linked to the project as a whole. While the projects should build on evidence of what works (e.g., from previous available research), they should have an applied nature and lead to practical applications. Projects should not only develop a sound methodology using available evidence and recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but also include a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits, positive outcomes and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries, and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. All applications should describe how access to the selected target group(s) will be assured, considering, where appropriate, whether it is useful to ground activities to a place/geographical space also, e.g. school, workplace, museums, city, etc. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for children. This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposals should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
Projects for each of the priorities under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players, such as child protection agencies, Barnahus, police, health services, the education sector, the judiciary, victim support organisations, etc. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players. Good quality cooperation among partners will be instrumental in making innovative projects successful. Regardless of whether projects are national or transnational in nature, they should aim to produce results that create or contribute to implementation of standards at European level, or that could be transferable to other Member States.
Applicants are invited to take note of and learn from previously funded projects (see bibliography). The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling-up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with one of the priorities. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
For projects in the area of violence against children, projects must take a rights-based approach[1] and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC). Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.
Support of public authority
It is strongly encouraged to involve a public authority, including regional and local authorities, to actively participate in the projects. For projects related to gender-based violence, these public authorities can be national, regional or local Ministries/agencies/equality bodies responsible for gender equality and/or provision of services to victims of violence or perpetrators; police, judicial, health or education authorities etc., as relevant.
The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project description and implementation.
This support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application and will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project foresees direct contact with children, every beneficiary of funding (including partners) needs to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy (not a cumulative one per consortium).
A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas (for more information please see “Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them” https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en_1.pdf):
policy: how the organisation is committed to preventing, protecting and responding to harm to children
people: clear responsibilities and expectations on its staff and associates and supports them to understand and act in line with these
procedures: the organisation creates a child-safe environment through implementing child safeguarding procedures that are applied across the organisation
accountability: the organisation monitors and reviews its safeguarding measures. What are the mechanisms in place within the organisation.
A child protection policy must include clear information about the recruitment of all staff – including trainees and volunteers, including background checks (vetting).
A child protection policy must include clear procedures and rules to staff, including reporting rules, and continuous training on this should be in place.
The child protection policy should be available online, i.e. transparent to all those who come in contact with the organisation.
The child protection policy document is to be submitted as Annex 4 and will be assessed under the operational capacity criteria.
Applying behavioural insights (priority 1)
For priority 1 - Preventing gender-based violence, applicants are requested to apply insights and practical tools from behavioural sciences in their projects in view of achieving changes in attitudes and behaviour. Below is a step-by-step approach to guide applicants in the incorporation of behavioural insights in their projects.
1) First, applicants should provide a clear description of the issue that will be tackled by the proposed action. If we consider gender-based violence, the description should specify the type(s) of violence (for example physical, emotional), its characteristics (for example prevalence, severity) and the concrete context(s) (for example university, workplace, household) that will be covered by the proposed action. Additionally, the objective(s) of the action should be clearly defined. These should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely (SMART) and should be set ahead of the action.
2) Second, the proposed action should identify the underlying determinants (also called behavioural causes) of the issue at stake.[2] This could be, for example, passive stance of bystanders, low reporting of violence by victims. As the issues identified under point 1 likely have multiple underlying determinants, the proposed action could focus on several of these, or on only one. Each of the different underlying determinants the projects aims to tackle should be clearly indicated in the proposal.
3) Third, the proposed action should encourage a specific target group(s) to perform target behaviour(s) or discourage them from doing so.[3] Actions may aim, for instance, at encouraging victims of violence to report the incidences of violence to the relevant authorities and/or to seek help in dedicated shelters; aim at changing ways of working of professionals to make it easier to report incidences of violence; aim at motivating journalists to avoid stereotypes by changing the way they report on and portray violence against women; or aim at changing men's perception of traditional gender roles, which support the acceptability of violence against women, etc.
4) Fourth, once the target group(s), the underlying determinants and the target behaviour are identified, applicants should describe the solutions (also called behavioural levers) that will be implemented.[4] For example, if the proposed action aims at reducing the social acceptance of gender-based violence, the project could focus on changing social norms (for example, signalling the appropriate behaviour by comparing an individual’s conduct with that of the majority of his /her peers/neighbours/friends), or make use of so-called ""commitment devices"" (convincing the target group to make a public pledge to carry out a certain behaviour/ support the target group in developing a specific plan to achieve a certain goal) as part of the intervention.
5) Fifth, the proposed action should specify the outcome that the proposed solution aims at generating and how the outcome(s) will be measured. Outcomes refer to impact, change in attitudes or behavioural change resulting from the action, and should not be confused with project outputs (e.g. number of leaflets published, number of people reached). If possible, projects should propose a measurable objective, compared to a baseline. For example, if the goal is to increase reporting of violence, a valuable outcome measure would be the number of cases reported to the police following the implementation of the project. If the goal is to change attitudes of a certain group of professionals, projects should not only measure how many attended training, but also ask them about their attitudes before and after the training. All interventions should include collection of relevant data, to be able to compare the situation before and after the project.
6) Sixth, to find out whether the proposed actions will have the desired effects, ideally the project should include a phase of pre-testing the solutions before implementing them in full-scale.[5] Such ex-ante assessment of the expected effect of the intervention will provide valuable insights on whether the proposed action has the intended effects and helps to ensure that, once fully deployed, the action focus is on what works. One possibility would be to use a randomised controlled trial.[6]
7) Seventh, the proposed action should include an evaluation of impact. Such evaluation should be part of the initial project plan, to make sure that the most appropriate evaluation design is used, and to set up valid outcomes measures (together with robust and feasible metrics) that allow the actual impact of the action to be determined. Several evaluation methods can be used such as after-only designs, before-after or pre-post designs, RCTs and field experiments.[7]
Mainstreaming
Projects funded under this call shall also seek to promote equality between women and men and the rights of the child. Gender and rights of the child mainstreaming means integrating a gender and rights of the child perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a project, as appropriate. Consequently, when relevant, the applicant shall take the necessary steps to ensure that gender equality and child-related issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men and of children. It is, for example, essential that projects do not silence, stereotype, stigmatise, lay the blame on or discriminate against women or men. Projects should contribute to empowering women and to ensuring that they achieve their full potential and enjoy the same rights as men.
Non-discrimination
Projects funded under this call shall also comply with the prohibition of discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ""Charter""), in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter. Among others the Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all its staff and team. The beneficiary is encouraged to foster an appropriate mix of people, whatever their ethnic origin, religion, age, gender and ability.
Finally, all projects under this call shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter.
Child participation
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate[8] and all project activities must clearly integrate and protect the child's right to be heard[9]. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral in every stage of the project’s design, implementation and evaluation.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator[10], in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. For priority 1 - Preventing gender-based violence, this should go well beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and consider how best to assess how activities and the use of project outputs impact on attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group(s), e.g. there is lower tolerance of gender-based violence and the target group reports actual intervention or states they are more likely to intervene when witnessing it, or when witnessing a situation that could lead to gender-based violence, victims are more likely to report experiences of violence, the target group uses learned techniques in their daily/working life, etc. Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. For priority 1, it should provide reliable results on ""what works"" and ""what does not work"".[11]
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached. Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

The inclusion of a control group and the use of randomisation allow the comparison of the outcome of in Region A against the outcome in Region B, hence determining whether the intervention was effective, all other things being equal.

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
1. Preventing and combating gender-based violence - Indicative amount: € 7 020 000
1.1. Prevention, protection and/or support of victims of domestic violence[[1]
The focus is on gender-based violence in the domestic sphere, including harmful practices, in line with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention[2]), particularly Chapters III and IV related to prevention, support and protection measures. Such focus will contribute to implement obligations under EU law concerning victims' rights (particularly Directive 2012/29/EU, Directive 2011/99/EU28 and Regulation (EU) No 606/201328).
Projects may tackle this specific form of violence through either/or:
- Prevention: actions such as those bringing about attitudinal and behavioural change and raising awareness of domestic violence (as defined in Art. 3b of the Istanbul Convention); development of tools to help recognise and address early signs of domestic violence such as systematic screening for signs of domestic violence by medical practitioners (or other practitioners in services not directly linked to domestic violence support, for example social or educational services); programmes aimed at empowering victims to report violence, helping to achieve report rates that reflect the real scale of violence;
- Protection: measures such as those aimed at promoting multi-disciplinary cooperation and capacity-building for relevant professionals involved in victim protection and support activities to ensure that timely and effective protection measures are in place to guarantee a victim's safety and prevent further violence; development of methods and protocols for risk assessments and their effective implementation;
- Support: actions such as training and capacity-building of victim support professionals assisting and supporting victims to ensure that victims are fully informed of their rights and referred to the appropriate services (such as legal and psychological counselling, housing, health care and social services); development of programmes to empower victims to gain economic independence (such as providing shelter, child care, education, training and assistance in finding employment).
1.2 Protection and support for victims of gender-based violence amongst particularly vulnerable groups
The focus is on the protection and support for adult victims of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, rape, from particularly vulnerable groups including but not limited to young women, people with a migrant background, asylum-seekers, refugees, LGBTI persons, ethnic minorities (including Roma people), women with disabilities, women living and/or working on the street.
Actions should focus on facilitating access to protection and support services for these victims addressing their specific needs (whether provided by law enforcement, the justice system, victim support services or social and health services) and on multi-disciplinary cooperation and capacity building for relevant professionals in contact with these groups to ensure timely and effective protection and support. Prevention work specifically targeting these groups (such as awareness-raising and communication campaigns) may also be considered.
1.3 Prevention of and responses to sexual harassment
The focus is on the prevention of and responses to sexual harassment, including cyber-harassment. The concept of ""sexual harassment"" refers to any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. Actions may address both physical or psychological offline and online harassment.
Actions should focus on developing tools for reporting incidents: awareness raising amongst groups at risk (e.g. young adult social media users) and victims in order to educate about risks and rights, empower victims to report incidents and claim their rights; developing guidelines and manuals for specialised support services (e.g. in the work place, schools, universities, online); and capacity-building for relevant professionals. Actions with a broader focus such as public awareness-raising to tackle prejudices and gender stereotypes and norms that encourage or condone sexual harassment may also be considered.
Projects targeting a young adult population are encouraged.
2. Preventing and combating violence against children - Indicative amount: € 4 680 000
Violence against children is understood as ""all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect of negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation including sexual abuse"" as listed in Article 19(1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and in alignment with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child's General comment No. 13 (2011) on the right of the child to freedom from all forms of violence.[3] Article 39 of the UNCRC enshrines the right to rehabilitation of child victims. Moreover, the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development[4] 16.2 target aims to “End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children”.
Several EU instruments, including the 10 Principles for integrated child protection systems[5], aim to promote the protection of children from all forms of violence as well as the rehabilitation of child victims.
This priority will focus on three areas:
2.1 Capacity-building for trainee and in-service medical practitioners (including but not limited to general practitioners, dentists, paediatricians, nurses, accident and emergency practitioners), social service practitioners, police and the education sector (including early childhood education and care, schoolteachers, other school/early childhood education and care staff), with the aim of systemising robust prevention, detection, identification and responses to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), with a clear focus on promoting positive and caring relationships to foster resilience. This call does not aim to record or add up ACE scores, but rather to promote awareness of what ACEs are, and their potential impact, and to strengthen caring and responsive support networks. The presence of just one caring and compassionate adult in a child’s life can make all the difference. Any capacity-building should be conducted by expert practitioners in the field.
Adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse, neglect, living with a household member who is an alcoholic or drug user, who has been imprisoned, or diagnosed with mental illness, among others, not only affect children’s development but may also affect their health and wellbeing throughout the life course. Children may be labelled or stigmatised or diagnosed as having ‘behavioural’ issues, without due understanding of and response to the trauma(s) suffered by the child. At the same time, there is a good evidence-base for factors that promote a child’s resilience and mitigate potential harms from ACEs.
2.2 Capacity-building for specialist forensic interviewers for child victims of violence (in line with how the role is assigned at country level: e.g. national child protection systems, the police, the prosecutor, Barnahus, etc), with the aim of systemising forensic interviewing specialists, preventing further trauma to child victims, ensuring a pathway to therapy and improving prosecution rates. Any capacity-building must be conducted by expert practitioners in the field.
Repeated interviews of child victims of violence may cause re-traumatisation and may impede due process. As recognised in multiple international[6], EU[7] and Council of Europe[8] legal instruments and policy documents, interviewers should be trained and specialised in working with children. In some countries, the geographic coverage of specialist forensic interviewers for children is not yet assured and children may have no access to a specialised forensic interviewer or have to travel long distances. Furthermore, specialisation requires access to continuous and expert training, provided by experts according to evidence-based practice and protocols, with a strong focus on taking account of each child’s individual needs and characteristics. Proposals under this strand are expected to take account of the learning from previous EU-funded projects.[9]
2.3 Capacity-building for trainee and in-service specialist practitioners providing evidence-based and trauma-informed therapeutic services and treatment to child victims of violence, with the aim of systemising the adequate national coverage of therapeutic services for child victims, taking account of individual children as well as groups of children and children as a group (e.g. in cases of mass victimisation and/or terrorism). Any capacity-building must be conducted by expert practitioners in the field.
As enshrined in multiple international[10], EU[11] and Council of Europe[12] legal instruments, victims have the right to assistance in their recovery. In particular, children exposed to trauma are entitled to receive child-sensitive support and treatment.
The proposals submitted for funding need to seek to systematise the adequate national coverage of therapeutic services for child victims in a given territory. The capacity-building is envisaged for in-service practitioners and trainee practitioners. The proposals can cover children as individuals, or children as a group (e.g. natural disaster, terrorist attack) where preparedness to meet the needs of child victims may be low). The project rationale should be well explained.
2. Description of the activities
Activities shall include:
- awareness-raising and empowerment activities;
- capacity-building and training for professionals;
- design and implementation of protocols, development of working methods and tools;
- exchange of good practices, mutual learning;
Practical projects developing and implementing concrete measures are preferred. While research is not excluded, if some research activities are to be part of the project, they shall be strictly linked to the project as a whole and be designed so as to not duplicate existing research.
Activities must take place in countries participating to the REC Programme to be eligible for funding.
Support of public authority
It is strongly encouraged to involve a public authority, including regional and local authorities, to be actively involved in the projects. For projects related to gender-based violence, these public authorities can be national, regional or local Ministries/agencies/equality bodies responsible for gender equality and/or provision of services to victims of violence or perpetrators; police, judicial, health or education authorities etc., as relevant. For projects related to children, these public authorities can be Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services, national guardianship institutions, Ministries for children, child protection, education, health, social affairs, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, law enforcement authorities etc). The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project Description and Implementation.
This support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application and will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the beneficiaries of funding (including partners) need to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy if they will be working directly with children (not a cumulative one per consortium). However, given the subject matter of these calls, for all projects concerning children, child safeguarding must be central to project design and implementation, and must be addressed. The applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to in Annex 4 to their application.
A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas (for more information please see “Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them”: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en_1.pdf):
policy: how the organisation is committed to preventing, protecting and responding to harm to children
people: clear responsibilities and expectations on its staff and associates and supports them to understand and act in line with these,
procedures: the organisation creates a child-safe environment through implementing child safeguarding procedures that are applied across the organisation
accountability: the organisation monitors and reviews its safeguarding measures. A child protection policy should include clear information about the recruitment of all staff – including trainees and volunteers, including background checks (vetting).
A child protection policy must include clear procedures and rules to staff, including reporting rules, and continuous training on this should be in place.
The child protection policy should be available online, i.e. transparent to all those who come in contact with the organisation.
The applicant’s child safeguarding/protection policy will be assessed under selection criteria (operational capacity of the applicant and partners).

This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts on the lives of beneficiaries. Research activities are not excluded, but the accent is put on the practical side and projects should include a combination of elements to form a coherent whole. While the projects should build on evidence of what works (e.g., from previous available research), they should have an applied nature and lead to practical applications. Projects should not only develop a sound methodology using available evidence and recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but also include a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits, positive outcomes and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries, and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. All applications should describe how access to the selected target group(s) will be assured, considering, where appropriate, whether it is useful to ground activities to a place/geographical space also, e.g. school, workplace, museums, city, etc. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for children. This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposals should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
Projects for each of the priorities under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players, such as child protection agencies, Barnahus, police, health services, the education sector, the judiciary, victim support organisations, etc. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players. Good quality cooperation among partners will be instrumental in making innovative projects successful. Regardless of whether projects are national or transnational in nature, they should aim to produce results that create or contribute to implementation of standards at European level, or that could be transferable to other Member States.
Applicants are invited to take note of and learn from previously funded projects (see bibliography). The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling-up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with one of the priorities. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
For projects in the area of violence against children, projects must take a rights-based approach[13] and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC). Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.
Applying behavioural insights (priority 1)
For priority 1 - Preventing and combating gender-based violence, applicants are encouraged – wherever possible – to apply insights and practical tools from behavioural sciences in their projects in view of achieving changes in attitudes and behaviour. Below is a step-by-step approach to guide applicants in the incorporation of behavioural insights in their projects. For illustrative purposes, the examples below refer to gender-based violence, though the same reasoning could apply to other issues.
1) First, applicants should provide a clear description of the issue that will be tackled by the proposed action. If we consider gender-based violence, the description should specify the type(s) of violence (for example physical, emotional), its characteristics (for example prevalence, severity) and the concrete context(s) (for example university, workplace, household) that will be covered by the proposed action. Additionally, the objective(s) of the action should be clearly defined. These should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely (SMART) and should be set ahead of the action.
2) Second, the proposed action should identify the underlying determinants (also called behavioural causes) of the issue at stake.[14] This could be, for example, passive stance of bystanders, low reporting of violence by victims. As the issues identified under point 1 likely have multiple underlying determinants, the proposed action could focus on several of these, or on only one. Each of the different underlying determinants the projects aims to tackle should be clearly indicated in the proposal.
3) Third, the proposed action should encourage a specific target group(s) to perform target behaviour(s) or discourage them from doing so.[15] Actions may aim, for instance, at encouraging victims of violence to report the incidences of violence to the relevant authorities and/or to seek help in dedicated shelters; aim at changing ways of working of professionals to make it easier to report incidences of violence; aim at motivating journalists to avoid stereotypes by changing the way they report on and portray violence against women; or aim at changing men's perception of traditional gender roles, which support the acceptability of violence against women, etc.
4) Fourth, once the target group(s), the underlying determinants and the target behaviour are identified, applicants should describe the solutions (also called behavioural levers) that will be implemented.[16] For example, if the proposed action aims at reducing the social acceptance of gender-based violence, the project could focus on changing social norms (for example, signalling the appropriate behaviour by comparing an individual’s conduct with that of the majority of his /her peers/neighbours/friends), or make use of so-called ""commitment devices"" (convincing the target group to make a public pledge to carry out a certain behaviour/ support the target group in developing a specific plan to achieve a certain goal) as part of the intervention.
5) Fifth, the proposed action should specify the outcome that the proposed solution aims at generating and how the outcome(s) will be measured. Outcomes refer to impact, change in attitudes or behavioural change resulting from the action, and should not be confused with project outputs (e.g. number of leaflets published, number of people reached). If possible, projects should propose a measurable objective, compared to a baseline. For example, if the goal is to increase reporting of violence, a valuable outcome measure would be the number of cases reported to the police following the implementation of the project. If the goal is to change attitudes of a certain group of professionals, projects should not only measure how many attended training, but also ask them about their attitudes before and after the training. All interventions should include collection of relevant data, to be able to compare the situation before and after the project.
6) Sixth, to find out whether the proposed actions will have the desired effects, ideally the project should include a phase of pre-testing the solutions before implementing them in full-scale.[17] Such ex-ante assessment of the expected effect of the intervention will provide valuable insights on whether the proposed action has the intended effects and helps to ensure that, once fully deployed, the action focus is on what works. One possibility would be to use a randomised controlled trial.[18]
7) Seventh, the proposed action should include an evaluation of impact. Such evaluation should be part of the initial project plan, to make sure that the most appropriate evaluation design is used, and to set up valid outcomes measures (together with robust and feasible metrics) that allow the actual impact of the action to be determined. Several evaluation methods can be used such as after-only designs, before-after or pre-post designs, RCTs and field experiments.[19]
Mainstreaming
Projects funded under this call shall also seek to promote equality between women and men and the rights of the child. Gender and rights of the child mainstreaming means integrating a gender and rights of the child perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a project, as appropriate. Consequently, when relevant, the applicant shall take the necessary steps to ensure that gender equality and child-related issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men and of children. It is, for example, essential that projects do not silence, stereotype, stigmatise, lay the blame on or discriminate against women or men. Projects should contribute to empowering women and to ensuring that they achieve their full potential and enjoy the same rights as men.
Non-discrimination
Projects funded under this call shall also comply with the prohibition of discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ""Charter""), in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter. Among others the Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all its staff and team. The beneficiary is encouraged to foster an appropriate mix of people, whatever their ethnic origin, religion, age, gender and ability.
Finally, all projects under this call shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter.
Child participation
All proposals relevant to children are expected to respect the child's right to participate[20]. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project: in designing training and protocols, developing working methods, reviewing services, establishing complaint mechanisms, assessing what needs to be changed at system level, empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them, etc.[21].In the context of trauma, according to Dr Bessel Van Der Kolk, “trauma invariably involves not being seen, not being mirrored, and not being taken into account. Treatment needs to reactivate the capacity to safely mirror, and be mirrored, by others, but also to resist being hijacked by others’ negative emotions.”[22] Proposals therefore need to be attentive to what child participation means in the different contexts and to properly address the child’s right to be heard.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator[23], in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. For priority 1 - Preventing and combating gender-based violence, this should go well beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and consider how best to assess how activities and the use of project outputs impact on attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group(s), e.g. there is lower tolerance of gender-based violence and the target group reports actual intervention or states they are more likely to intervene when witnessing it, or when witnessing a situation that could lead to gender-based violence, victims are more likely to report experiences of violence, the target group uses learned techniques in their daily/working life, etc. Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. For priorities 1, it should provide reliable results on ""what works"" and ""what does not work"".[24]
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached. Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

[18]In case quantitative pretesting using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is carried out, this phase includes the identification of the most feasible randomisation unit (i.e., individual or group). For example, the initiative could be delivered in all universities of Region A (the treatment group), keeping the curriculum of universities of Region B (the control group) unchanged (randomisation at the group level). The inclusion of a control group and the use of randomisation allow the comparison of the outcome of in Region A against the outcome in Region B, hence determining whether the intervention was effective, all other things being equal. See « Test, Learn, Adapt » (UK BIT, 2012) for more information on this approach.

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
The priority of this restricted call for proposals for action grants is to support the setting up or reinforcing of national consultation processes in the Member States, through National Roma Platforms convened and managed by National Roma Contact Points (NRCPs).
NRCPs were appointed by Member States, in line with the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/files/roma_nationalcontactpoints_en.pdf) to coordinate the development and implementation of the National Roma Integration Strategy, or integrated sets of policy measures within their broader social inclusion policies (thereafter: NRIS).
The Council Recommendation on effective Roma integration measures in the Member States confirms that NRCPs should facilitate the participation and involvement of Roma civil society in the implementation of NRIS and local action plans. The National Roma Platforms will contribute decisively to this process.
The National Roma Platforms are expected to encourage and facilitate dialogue and exchanges, promote mutual learning, cooperation and involvement in implementation and monitoring, reporting and policy review between all national stakeholders. Inclusion of Roma people, in particular Roma women and youth, in the Platform is strongly encouraged.
The objectives of the Platforms are:
to empower the NRCPs in the process of Roma integration, to give them the necessary visibility towards all relevant stakeholders, whether at national, regional or local level, towards Roma and non-Roma communities;
to ensure effective involvement of all relevant stakeholders (i.e. national, regional, local authorities, Roma and non-Roma communities including Roma youth and Roma women, Roma and pro-Roma non-governmental organisations (NGOs), private entrepreneurs, trade unions, professional associations, academia, Equality bodies, etc.) in decisions that affect Roma, taking into account the roles of each stakeholder;
to improve multi-stakeholder participation, in particular participation of Roma in decisions that affect them;
to strengthen multi-stakeholder accountability, commitment to, as well as ownership and transparency of the process of Roma integration;
to boost the commitment to and effective implementation of integration measures at the local level with a view to improving the effective equal access of Roma to mainstream services and opportunities, as well as to local level community building between Roma and non-Roma;
to address the gaps in the implementation of the National Roma Integration Strategy and the challenges which are specific to the national context;
to feed reporting processes at national and EU level.
2. Description of the activities
This call will fund activities supporting active partnership between stakeholders in the development, implementation and monitoring of the National Roma Integration Strategies or integrated sets of policy measures in the Member States.
Member States using Commission support under the previous calls (REC-RDIS-NRCP-AG) to set up National Roma Platforms should set out how they intend to maintain and further develop them.
Proposals of Member States that have not applied for support under the above mentioned previous calls shall present the methodology to be used for the setting up or reinforcing and restructuring of National Roma Platforms, by inclusive and transparent involvement of all relevant stakeholders with a focus on implementation and monitoring of National Roma Integration Strategies and integrated set of measures, and for the implementation of their activities.
The National Roma Platforms should not be considered as one-off events or conferences but as an ongoing, joint process in which all relevant stakeholders work closely together towards better integration of Roma.
Activities should support nationally led participatory multi-stakeholder processes of working meetings aimed at strengthening partnership across all levels, including government authorities, regional and local authorities, civil society organisations, including Roma youth and Roma women organisations, private sector, academia, etc. The use of participatory methodologies, including with the help of professional facilitators, is encouraged.
Activities may include:
Meetings and events at national, regional or local levels of National Roma Platforms, including their preparation, organisation and follow-up activities.
Evaluation and review of NRIS and Roma integration measures, exchange and transfer of practices that proved effective at the local level.
Transnational exchange between different National Roma Platforms to promote policy learning and transfer of good practices.
The following concrete activities might be included in the proposal:
activities aimed at making stakeholder participation effective, including the identification of stakeholders, capacity building actions, integration of their inputs in shaping policies relevant to Roma integration;
working meetings aiming at ensuring proper communication with all stakeholders;
activities focusing on empowerment and participation of Roma youth and women organisations;
organisation of an opening ""Kick Off"" meeting with participation of all relevant stakeholders (with balanced geographical coverage) in order to explain the process as well as the Member State's approach towards Roma integration;
organisation of topical discussions/focused group discussions/good practices working meetings, notably on education, employment, health, housing and anti-discrimination issues, which would address the needs/priorities/obstacles/challenges at national/ regional/local level;
funding opportunities;
Roma education and how best to advance the education of Roma children, involving educators, Roma parents, representatives of municipalities, social workers, Roma mediators, Roma assistants;
the involvement of trade unions, private sector in increasing employability of Roma and on an integrated approach in the area of housing and health;
activities aimed at facilitating dialogue between Roma and non-Roma communities and local authorities to explain the mutual benefits of Roma integration measures for both communities.
The following types of activities will not be funded by the Commission:
activities supporting individual political parties;
provision of financial support to third parties;
legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives.
This call focuses on national activities.
3. Expected results
increased number of the national Platforms seen as an integral component of the coordination and monitoring activities of the NRCPs to foster the process for dialogue, cooperation and coordination of stakeholders;
increased capacity of national experts to address issues related to Roma integration;
strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent national authorities and all other stakeholders in relation to Roma integration;

1.1. Priorities
This call aims to establish 4-year Framework Partnership Agreements with European networks whose statutory aims are to promote equality between women and men and to advance gender mainstreaming. The annual grants to be signed on the basis of these Framework Partnership Agreements will enhance the capacities of these networks to contribute actively to the development and implementation of the policies in this area.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
The 4-year strategic plan will have to fit with the European Commission's objectives in this field and so be aligned with the 2016-2019 Strategic engagement for gender equality's main objectives. Within this framework, the activities of the networks should contribute to one or more of the following priorities:
supporting the development, implementation and monitoring of gender equality policies and legislation at EU and national levels;
promoting equality between women and men in the implementation of the Europe2020 Strategy and promoting the economic and business case for gender equality across the EU;
promoting gender mainstreaming in EU and national policies and supporting national member organisations' involvement in the promotion of the gender equality aspects of the main EU policies, including the implementation of the gender perspective in the European Structural and Investment Funds;
strengthening the capacity of national member organisations and their knowledge of EU gender equality policies by providing information and advice on European gender equality concerns;
improving the knowledge and understanding of discrimination and inequalities between women and men in Member States (including multiple discrimination);
contributing to an effective legal protection against discrimination on the basis of the various EU-directives implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men;
raising public awareness and disseminating information about women's rights, the rights to gender equality and their benefits to society.
The networks' activities carried over the 4 years should support national member organizations' involvement –at national level- in the promotion of the gender equality aspects in the areas of employment, social inclusion and poverty, education, research, external relations, etc. EU-level networks should also encourage the cooperation between their national members and social partner organisations at national level.
This call will support networks whose activities contribute to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme and who will implement among others: analytical activities, training activities, mutual learning, cooperation, awareness-raising and dissemination activities.
The annual operating grant to be provided based on these Framework Partnership Agreements will finance the expenditure linked to the activities of these networks, insofar as they are in line with the objectives of the Programme in the area concerned and with the annual priorities that may be established by the Commission. The costs of general administrative expenditure necessary for the running of these organisations may also be covered."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The aim of the call is to support projects by Member States that analyse existing gender gaps and develop effective measures to tackle them, in particular the gender gap in pensions. The underlying reasons for women's lower income and women's greater risk of poverty are manifold: women participate less in the labour market, they work fewer hours, and they are paid less than men on average. Also the take up of family-related leaves and time spent on care work have an impact on women's earnings. There are inequalities in study subject choices and careers patterns, and women often face glass ceilings when it comes to accessing decision-making positions. Gendered patterns in education partly explain the gender segregation in the labour market. All this leads to the persistence of the gender pay gap, the gender earnings gap and the gender gap in pensions. Gender gaps in pay, pensions and participation hinder women's economic independence.
The expected impact of the projects is to contribute to reducing the gender gap in pay, earnings and pensions and the higher risk of poverty faced by older women, for example by supporting men and women to make informed choices throughout their life and by combatting obstacles to the economic independence of women. At aggregate level, tackling the gender gap in pensions and its underlying causes contributes to the sustainability of social protection systems: equal economic independence at all ages means that each individual woman/man is able to live out of its own work and is able to fully contribute to the social protection system.
This specific call will also respond to the call of the Council of the European Union to raise awareness on the gender pension gap and to ensure that women and men ""remain in quality employment over the whole life cycle, resulting in higher labour force participation and fuller careers and thus an earnings history that will result in an adequate pension"" (Council conclusions adopted in September 2015).
This call for proposals aims to achieve the objectives defined in the Strategic engagement for gender equality 2015-2019 (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/documents/151203_strategic_engagement_en.pdf) and the European Pact for gender equality (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2011:155:0010:0013:EN:PDF). Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposal is aligned with EU policies and with the documents referred to below.
The annual Report on equality between women and men which takes stock of the EU's achievements and highlights the remaining gender gaps (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/document/index_en.htm#annual_reports).
The opinion of the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men delivered on ""reducing the gender gap in pensions"" (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/opinions_advisory_committee/140213_final_opinion_gpg_en.pdf) which was delivered in 2014.
The Council Conclusions “Equal income opportunities for women and men: Closing the gender gap in pensions"" (http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9302-2015-INIT/en/pdf).
The 2015 Pension Adequacy Report which dedicated a special section to the gender gap in pensions (http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&langId=en&pubId=7828&visible=0).
1.2. Description of the activities
Project activities may include:
testing approaches to tackle existing gender gaps in pay and in pension and their root causes;
analytical activities such as development of ex ante evaluation, impact assessment of measures addressing gender gaps in pensions; or gender analysis of pension reforms;
mutual learning, exchange of good practices, development of working methods which may be transferable to other countries;
exchange and provision of information to men and women on their pension entitlements, in particular on relevant main parameters of employment decisions that affect future pensions, such as part-time work (In Austria an information brochure on pensions aiming at informing women about the effects of part-time and parental leave on their pension entitlement; and raising women’s awareness for this topic was edited in 2015. The brochure provides a comprehensive and understandable overview about the Austrian pension system and consequences of life/career decisions on pension entitlements. Based on the principle of the ""orange envelope"" in Sweden each citizen could be regularly informed of the national pension gap and its underlying reasons. In Sweden, every person who has earned an income receives a value statement from the Pensions Agency – an orange envelope. It shows the balance on accounts for income and premium pensions and for the majority, a forecast of their future national retirement pension);
development of information tools like ICT-based “pension calculators” where people can find out the consequences of different wage levels, hours worked, career interruptions and retirement ages on their future pensions;
awareness-raising activities on the underlying reasons of the pension gap (Such as the Swedish awareness raising campaigns: https://www.pensionsmyndigheten.se/helalivet; http://static.pensionsmyndigheten.se/kampanj/smabarnsforalder/) or equal pension days (Such days already exist in Austria, Germany and Switzerland).
1.3. Methodology
In the preparation and drafting of their proposal, applicants are encouraged to review measures already conducted in this field, their effects and sustainability, and assess the possibility of reproducing the promising and effective ones and developing tools to measure their impact, as relevant. Proposals should show how the applicants learn from previous experiences and build on this preliminary desk research.
The proposal shall provide a detailed profile of the target population and demonstrate the existence of a clear problem and a real need for public intervention in the specific area that the project will cover. It should provide a rigorous description of the activities to be carried out, explaining how these are likely to address the identified need in the countries participating in the proposal and the expected results on the target population. The rationale for project design choices must be clearly explained.
Applicants are encouraged to embed a ""behavioural"" approach in their project, as a solution to the issues at stake often requires behavioural change. Behavioural sciences seek to understand how people make decisions in practice; how their behaviour is influenced by the context in which their decisions are made and how they are likely to respond to certain options. We welcome applications that clearly identify the behavioural element at stake (i.e. the factor(s) that help(s) determining success of a given initiative) (see document annexed for further guidance).
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator, in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. This should go beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, but assess how activities and the use of deliverables have led to attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group and therefore promoted gender equality. Whenever possible, evaluations should encompass evidence on changes in both attitudes and behaviours, as a change in attitudes might not necessarily lead to a change in behaviour. When gathering evidence on attitudes, the evaluator should reflect on the possible effects of social desirability (i.e. the possibility that respondents do not state a particular opinion if they know that this opinion is not socially accepted).
Monitoring and data collection
Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. It should provide reliable results on ""what works"" and ""what does not work"". Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons/professionals/ teachers/companies reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by gender and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Applications should also include a clear dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results.
1.4. Expected results
improved knowledge of the possible impacts of future measures to addressing gender gaps in pensions and of the gender impacts of pension reforms;
effective approaches to tackle existing gender gaps in pension and their root causes tested;
effective approaches to tackle existing gender gaps in pay and earnings and their root causes tested ;

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
A) The aim of the priority is to support projects promoting equality for women and men in public debates, in leadership positions in politics and in the corporate sector.
Women in the EU make up more than half of the population and of the electorate. Equal participation of women and men in public life and in politics is a matter of justice, respect for human rights and good governance. Gender balanced decision-making is also needed to reflect the composition of society, strengthen democracy and add new perspectives into the political debate. However, women continue to be under-represented in decision-making positions in politics at national and European level and progress has been slow and uneven, even if the situation varies greatly between Member States.
Moreover, women continue to be severely under-represented in leadership positions in the corporate sector, even if the economic and business case for gender balance in leadership is well established. Progress has been slow and mostly concentrated in countries that have adopted legislative measures to improve the situation. Supporting of initiatives by stakeholders such as awareness-raising; further development/dissemination of practical tools (European databases of qualified women, training programmes for women candidates, etc.); exchange of good practice and networking between key stakeholders are necessary to complement the Commission's legislative proposal on women on boards and to make further progress on the topic.
Women's voices and expertise are also under-represented in the media and in public debates and when women express themselves in these fora, they are often confronted with stereotypes and sexism. This contributes to further preventing women from participating in public debates.
For this reason, and in continuity with the current practice, activities will be implemented through an open call for proposals addressed to national ministries', NGOs or networks of NGOs, other non-profit organisations, social partners. The call aims to co-fund, inter alia, national/European information, awareness-raising, mentoring and training activities, further developing/dissemination of tools or strategies to support gender balance and networking and testing and exchange of best practice between the relevant stakeholders.
B) The aim of the priority is to support projects aiming at better enforcement of EU law on work-life balance and in particular of protection against dismissal and unfavourable treatment due to pregnancy or parenthood.
Addressing women's underrepresentation in the labour market is the main objective of the Commission's recent initiative on Work-Life Balance for parents and carers, a concrete deliverable of the Pillar, adopted on 27 April 2017, which aims at modernising the current EU legal and policy frameworks for work-life balance. In order to enhance reconciliation between work and private life for men and women, a multifaceted approach is needed. Hence a comprehensive package of measures is included in the Initiative on work life balance for working parents and carers, including a measures to enhance a better share of care responsibilities, the modernisation of family leaves and flexible working arrangements, access to high quality and affordable care responsibilities, measures to tackling financial disincentives for second earners and, last but not least, effective legal protection, for instance in case of dismissal for pregnant workers and workers on and returning from family leaves.
Protection against dismissal and unfavourable treatment is provided under EU law through the Maternity Leave Directive, the Part-time Work Directive, the Gender Equality Directive, the Directive on equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and the Parental Leave Directive. The protection has been reinforced by the case-law of the European Court of Justice. Unfavourable treatment of women when they become pregnant and for women and men due to take leave is still being reported in many Member States. It is therefore necessary to better inform workers and support them in the exercise of their rights to ensure that they are able to enforce them more effectively at the national level.
The Commission has ordered a legal study on dismissal protection in the countries and will organise, jointly with EQUINET, a capacity building seminar for equality bodies and labour inspectorates. The current call for projects aims to co-fund projects to raise awareness, develop tools and new approaches as well as analytical activities with regard to measures to enhance work-life balance and effective dismissal protection for workers with care responsibilities.
2. Description of the activities
Project activities may include:
A)
awareness-raising, communication activities (campaigns, etc);
capacity building, mentoring and training programmes for women candidates (and for journalists);
seminars and conferences;
develop/disseminate practical tools to increase gender balance;
exchange of good practice and successful strategies and networking between stakeholders.
Activities should have an impact on equal opportunities for women and men in public life and in particular leadership positions in politics and in the corporate sector.
B)
awarness-raising activities, communications campaign aimed at:
employers, underlining the economic benefits of unlocking and retaining the talent and experience of pregnant women and new mothers;
employers to better know and comply with their legal obligations;
employees to better know their rights;
testing, developing and disseminating creative approaches to:
attract, develop and retain women in the workforce before, during and after pregnancy;
facilitate the process to report and raise a complaint when a discriminatory practice occurs (clear complaints procedures, lower financial costs);
implement an efficient monitoring (of practices in companies such as recruitment practices and of early conciliation cases);
analytical activities such as development of ex ante evaluation, impact assessment of measures aimed at:
tackling practices such as employers seeking information about women’s pregnancy, motherhood or plans to have children that could be used to discriminate unlawfully during recruitment or white dismissal;
supporting small and medium-sized employers to spread the cost of providing enhanced maternity/parental pay (where they wish to do so) and cover for maternity/paternity/parental leave such as collective insurance schemes.
3. Expected results
A)
The relevant actors (governments, political parties, civil society, social partners, corporate sector, media, general public) are sensitized about the under-representation of women in leadership positions in politics at national and EU level and in private and public companies. They are informed on the benefits of balanced participation of women and men in leadership and on successful strategies to improve the situation. Practical tools are made available and used to support businesses and qualified women aspiring for leadership positions;
Concrete actions are implemented by stakeholders to increase gender balance in politics at national level and/or at EU level. Sexism is less prevalent in politics and public debates;
Concrete actions are implemented by stakeholders to increase gender balance in leadership in the corporate sector. Tools for sensitizing and supporting business and women aspiring for leadership positions to improve the situation are prepared, disseminated and used by relevant stakeholders. The number of women candidates and recruited to leadership positions in the corporate sector is expected to increase.
B)
Better enforcement of EU law on work-life balance and in particular of protection against dismissal and unfavourable treatment due to pregnancy or parenthood;
Employers are aware of their legal obligations towards pregnant women and parents;
Pregnant women and parents are better aware of their rights;
Decrease in discriminatory practices due to pregnancy and parenthood."

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
The restricted call for proposals will focus on the gender gaps over the life-cycle, looking at work-life balance for women and men, including through a better sharing of care. The aim is to support Member States in raising awareness and tackling gender stereotypes with regard to roles in work and in private life, and in particular with regard to reconciliation issues (including the promotion of the uptake of family-related leaves by men), taking into account national specificities, complemented by EU broad common messages.
Indeed, while the gender employment gap is very slowly decreasing and now stands at 11.5%[1], the gender pay gap remains stagnant at 16.2 %[2] and the gender pensions gap is 36.6%. The factors behind the gender pay gap are multiple but one of the main reasons is related to care responsibilities: women more often adapt their work to private time needs, for instance by working part-time, and they do more unpaid work, that is work done in the domestic sphere such as care for children, cooking or cleaning in one’s own house. They also take longer career breaks and their career choices have repercussions over the course of their working life. Comparing working men and women and the time spent on unpaid work in the 6th European Working Conditions Survey[3], women spend on average 22 hours per week on unpaid work while men spend 9 hours per week. More strikingly even is the differences between working men and women with a child under the age of 7 in their household: women spend 39 hours per week in unpaid work and 32 hours in paid work, while men work 19 hours per week in unpaid work and 41 hours in paid work.
This is not always in line with the preferences of workers. In a Eurobarometer on gender equality[4], more than eight in ten Europeans approve of the statement that a men should do an equal share of household activities, with half saying they strongly approve (50%). More than eight in ten also approve of a man taking parental leave to take care of his children with 52% saying they strongly approve of this.
Equally, a Eurobarometer on work-life[5] balances shows that attitudes towards family leaves and flexible working arrangements for family reasons are still problematic for a considerable amount of workers. A quarter of workers say it is not easy for them to take family leave or flexible working arrangements and that they feel discouraged by their employer and nearly four in ten think it has repercussions for their career and this is more the case so for men than for women with regard to family leaves. Financial reasons are also often a hindrance, especially for men as well as being able to take these leaves in a flexible manner, such as in blocks of time. Also, nearly three quarter of Europeans who are currently not in work say that flexible working arrangements would give them a better chance of entering paid work and for two thirds it would allow them to continue working instead of taking extended leaves or retirement.
In this respect, the call for proposals aims to support measures which will not only have consequences on the short term with regard to better work life balance for all workers, but would also allow more women to (re)enter the labour market and tackle the gender pay and pensions gaps.
Ultimately it aims at supporting men and women to make informed choices throughout their life and to promote good practices in companies. At aggregate level, better work-life balance helps men and women to be able to work and continue to work in combination with their private care responsibilities. More equal economic independence at all ages means higher employment rates for men and women and a more sustainable and potentially longer working life for all.
This call for proposals is in line with the current development at EU level following the initiative on work-life balance for working parents and carers of April 2017 and falls under the first and second thematic priority areas of the European Commission Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019.
2. Description of the activities
Whereas several measures and initiatives are listed, it is not requested to include all of them in a single project. Projects with a strong focus are very much valued.
Activities may consist of any of the following:
activities tackling negative attitudes and gender stereotypes with regard to care;
awareness-raising, education and empowerment activities; in particular, at individual and company level, awareness-raising activities on behaviours of men and women, their superiors and colleagues, concerning the combination of work and private care, attitudes towards certain working patterns by men and women as well as work-life balance friendly workplace practices;
exchange of good practice, mutual learning, seminars; in particular, activities promoting good practice examples of companies who address work-life balance for all workers in a comprehensive strategy, including innovative workplace practices in terms of space/time, adapted to different time needs of workers over the life course;
capacity-building and training activities for company actors and authorities.
Activities must take place in countries participating to the REC Programme to be eligible for funding.
3. Expected results
the issue of work-life balance for men and women in practice is discussed, building from a rights based approach into effective actions with regard to reconciliation between work and private life;
company behaviour is discussed and good practice examples are highlighted; addressing work-life balance is seen as strength which helps to retain good workers, increase motivation and productivity and reduce stress, mental health issues, prevent early exit from labour market and increase sustainability of work;
both men and women feel more comfortable in taking up leave arrangements, which, in combination with the use of care facilities, leads to a more equal share of care at household level;
female employment rates will be increased through a smoother combination of work with private life and a possible prevention from long family breaks from work.
Whereas numerous results are listed above, it is not expected for a single project to produce all of them. Projects bringing limited, but effective results are very much valued.
Applicants are invited to take note of previously funded projects.[1] The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling-up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with one of the priorities. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission or referred to below (see bibliography). The degree of relevance to the priorities of the call for proposals will be assessed under the award criterion ‘a) relevance’.
Applying behavioural insights
Applicants are encouraged to apply insights and practical tools from behavioural sciences in their projects in view of achieving changes in attitudes and behaviour. Below is a step-by-step approach to guide applicants in the incorporation of behavioural insights in their projects. For illustrative purposes, the examples below refer to gender-based violence, though the same reasoning could apply to other issues.
1) First, applicants should provide a clear description of the issue that will be tackled by the proposed action. If we consider attitudes and stereotypes with regard to care and workplace practices, the description should specify the type(s) of behaviour (or attitudes) or practices (for instance working time arrangements and practices)that will be covered by the proposed action. Additionally, the objective(s) of the action should be clearly defined. These should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely (SMART) and should be set ahead of the action.
2) Second, the proposed action should identify the underlying determinants (also called behavioural causes)[1] of the issue at stake. This could be, for example, passive stance of bystanders, low reporting of violence by victims. As the issues identified under point 1 likely have multiple underlying determinants, the proposed action could focus on several of these, or on only one. Each of the different underlying determinants the projects aims to tackle should be clearly indicated in the proposal.
3) Third, the proposed action should encourage a specific target group(s) to perform target behaviour(s)[2] or discourage them from doing so. Actions may aim, for instance, at changing men's perception of traditional gender roles, and their environment including the workplace environment, etc.
4) Fourth, once the target group(s), the underlying determinants and the target behaviour are identified, applicants should describe the solutions[3] (also called behavioural levers) that will be implemented. For example, if the proposed action aims at reducing the social acceptance of gender-based violence, the project could focus on changing social norms (if for example, signalling the appropriate behaviour by comparing an individual’s conduct with that of the majority of his /her peers/neighbours/friends), or make use of so-called ""commitment devices"" (convincing the target group to make a public pledge to carry out a certain behaviour/ support the target group in developing a specific plan to achieve a certain goal) as part of the intervention.
5) Fifth, the proposed action should specify the outcome that the proposed solution aims at generating and how the outcome(s) will be measured. Outcomes refer to impact, change in attitudes or behavioural change resulting from the action, and should not be confused with project outputs (e.g. number of leaflets published, number of people reached). If possible, projects should propose a measurable objective, compared to a baseline. For example, if the goal is to increase reporting of violence, a valuable outcome measure would be the number of cases reported to the police following the implementation of the project. If the goal is to change attitudes of a certain group of professionals, projects should not only measure how many attended training, but also ask them about their attitudes before and after the training. All interventions should include collection of relevant data, to be able to compare the situation before and after the project.
6) Sixth, to find out whether the proposed actions will have the desired effects, ideally the project should include a phase of pre-testing the solutions before implementing them in full-scale[4]. Such ex-ante assessment of the expected effect of the intervention will provide valuable insights on whether the proposed action has the intended effects and helps to ensure that, once fully deployed, the action focus is on what works. One possibility would be to use a randomised controlled trial.[5]
7) Seventh, the proposed action should include an evaluation of impact. Such evaluation should be part of the initial project plan, to make sure that the most appropriate evaluation design is used, and to set up valid outcomes measures (together with robust and feasible metrics) that allow the actual impact of the action to be determined. Several evaluation methods can be used such as after-only designs, before-after or pre-post designs, RCTs and field experiments.[11]
Mainstreaming
Projects funded under this call shall also seek to promote equality between women and men and, if relevant for the project, also the rights of the child. Gender and rights of the child mainstreaming means integrating a gender and rights of the child perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a project, as appropriate. Consequently, when relevant, the applicant shall take the necessary steps to ensure that gender equality and child-related issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men and of children. It is, for example, essential that projects do not silence, stereotype, stigmatise, lay the blame on or discriminate against women or men. Projects should contribute to empowering women and to ensuring that they achieve their full potential and enjoy the same rights as men.
Projects funded under this call shall also comply with the prohibition of discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ""Charter""), in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter. Among others the Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all its staff and team. The beneficiary is encouraged to foster an appropriate mix of people, whatever their ethnic origin, religion, age, gender and ability.
Finally, all projects under this call shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust, appropriate and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring (for further details please refer to ""Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers"", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion – see bibliography. See also “Turning the Curve: outcomes-based accountability” always in the bibliography).
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The aim of the pilot project on ""Europe of diversities"" is to enhance the motto of the European Union: ""United in diversity"" especially on local and regional level. With the pilot project EU citizens in regions with multicultural and multilingual background, or where minority groups are particularly excluded or subject to discrimination, would receive the possibility to understand better each other's culture, language and identity. Mutual understanding, acceptance and tolerance is a core element of fruitful coexistence of different ethnic, religious, national and linguistic groups, as well as of different generations and minority groups more generally. The pilot project would contribute to the work which has been already done in the field of non-discrimination, education and language learning, however the objective is to reach different groups of the society and to foster the multicultural dialogue between the EU citizens on local and regional level on one hand, and through the exchange of opportunities on EU-level on the other hand. One of the strengths and richness of the EU is in its diversity. Therefore it should be adequately promoted and made understood that it is an added value to the EU.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
The pilot project aims to:
finance trainings, seminars, workshops, and conferences on how to maintain the uniqueness of Europe of diversities and how to promote unity in diversity;
promote the exchange of good practices in fighting discrimination and promoting diversity at local and regional level;
help to identify and target discriminatory practices at local and regional level and build understanding between majority and minority societies.
Target group: local and regional stakeholders, in particular public authorities (cities, regions, municipalities), NGOs, youth organisations, schools, civil society and businesses.
While national projects are eligible, successful proposals should aim to produce results with EU added value.
The indicative available budget under this call for proposals is EUR 1.000.000.
The requested grant should preferably not be higher than EUR 250.000 or lower than EUR 150.000. The aim is to be able to co-fund at least four transnational projects. The Commission reserves the right not to award all available funds, depending on the projects received and the outcome of the evaluation procedure."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
European society has changed considerably over the last 25 years as EU citizens increasingly live and work in other Member States. EU citizenship gives these mobile EU citizens the right to vote and stand in elections to the European Parliament and to municipal elections under the same conditions as nationals of their host State. Mobile EU citizens may also wish to exercise their right to vote in their home states. Political participation is central to citizenship, and it is essential to legitimising decision making in government. However, EU citizen's political participation can be affected by red tape and outdated voting procedures. At the same time, low turnout in elections, including European Parliament elections and particularly among young people, is a challenge for democracies. To address these issues, ways should be explored to stimulate participation in elections for all citizens by making it easier to vote, including by making best use of modern technologies.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
The activities funded under this pilot project's call for action grants aiming to:
explore the role of internet services and applications in stimulating democratic participation and to investigate how digital tools can contribute to the stronger and longer-term democratic engagement of citizens;
elicit a broad range of proposals especially but not exclusively targeting young people and mobile EU citizens.
Stimulating democratic participation and contributing to stronger and longer-term democratic engagement should be understood in terms of (sustainably) increased voter turnout and voter engagement in the political process, and the activities which support this, such as accessible, efficient voting and registration processes, accessible and engaging political processes (such as involvement in candidate selection, debates etc), and accessible and transparent voter information. The results of these projects will contribute inter alia to a tele-voting good practice guide aiming to help make voting procedures more accessible to mobilise a broader group of voters and thus enhance democratic participation at the EU level. All projects must be prepared with a specific, though not necessarily exclusive perspective on the 2019 European Elections.
While national projects are eligible, successful proposals should aim to produce results with EU added value.
Projects must address the overall priority of exploring how digital tools, applications or internet services can be used to stimulate democratic participation and/or contribute to sustained engagement in citizens. Projects should be targeted and practical and aim to provide a demonstrable benefit for democratic life in the EU. Benefit in these terms is to be understood as potential to mobilise voters – particularly from the two groups indicated above – or sustaining, facilitating or strengthening their participation, through improved information, greater or smarter access to information (including political media literacy), analytical assistance (such as voter information tools), streamlined processes, accessibility aids, and tools, digital processes or good practices to support electoral authorities. Projects targeting tele-voting should consider how the secrecy and independence of the vote can be secured, alongside considerations of streamlining and accessibility. Projects targeting mobile EU citizens should reflect an awareness of EU initiatives and policies in this area, and the acquis on citizenship. Projects targeting young people should also be considered in the light of the aims of the current study procured by the Commission on the impact of internet and social media on youth (democratic) participation and youth work [see http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/about-eacea/calls-for-tender-eacea/study-impact-internet-and-social-media-youth-participation-and-youth-work_en].
Projects must be based on recognised, sound methodology. All project proposals must describe their success measures, and the methodology used to evaluate the benefits projects will deliver will be considered alongside the methodology used to deliver the projects themselves when evaluating their suitability.
Projects can approach providing benefit through investigation of the effectiveness of existing/newly developed interventions/tools/practices (as above), or by supporting the development of new interventions/tools/practices, or by supporting the use of existing/newly developed interventions/tools/practices through training, promotion or information. Projects which pursue the development of new interventions/tools/practices must propose how they will be used in the Member States, and proposals for training, promotion or information must consider how the widest possible dissemination/access to trained individuals will be achieved. Projects which investigate existing/newly developed interventions/tools/practices must explain how their outcomes will enhance their usefulness or otherwise achieve benefit in the terms set out above.
Projects which include interagency or multidisciplinary cooperation or collaboration will be valued positively, if that collaboration can be shown to deliver benefit in the terms set out above. The involvement of national or local authorities is likely to be needed for any successful project, and the specific authorities involved should be appropriate to the project's aims. However, there may be approaches to delivering benefit in terms of democratic participation which do not require official involvement or where direct official involvement is not appropriate.
Projects which target accessibility of the voting process or of democratic participation in a more general sense should clearly identify the groups that they are targeting and their needs which the project aims to address. Weight will be given to proposals which can demonstrate a direct impact on voter turnout. Projects which include information or promotion campaigns should set out specific agendas for when such campaigns will be carried out, their duration and expected impact, and the methodology by which such impact can be assessed.
The indicative available budget under this call for proposals is EUR 700,000.
The requested grant should preferably not be higher than EUR 350,000 or lower than EUR 75,000. The aim is to be able to co-fund at least two transnational projects. The Commission reserves the right not to award all available funds, depending on the projects received and the outcome of the evaluation procedure."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The identification and exchange of best practice will assist Member States’ authorities in ensuring the correct and full implementation of the EU Framework Decision on combatting certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law. Increased support in these actions also represents a follow up to the conclusions of the Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights of 1-2 October 2015 and reflects the priorities identified in the European Agenda on Security and in the conclusions of the Justice Ministers’ discussion on the justice response to the migration crisis, held at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 8-9 October.
The priority of this call for proposals is to promote the identification and exchange of best practices among public authorities which bear a responsibility in implementing the provisions of national legislation on hate crime and hate speech, and in particular provisions transposing the EU Framework Decision on combatting certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will mainly fund activities on mutual learning, exchange of good practices, strengthened cooperation and coordination between national authorities as regards the recording, investigation and prosecution of hate crime and hate speech incidents under relevant national provisions on hate crimes.
Projects bearing a direct relevance for the effective implementation of national provisions transposing the EU Framework Decision on combatting certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law are of particular interest.
Priority will be given to projects focusing on:
Concrete actions including training aiming at setting up and improving a methodology of recording incidents and data collection on hates speech and hate crime.
enhancing investigation and prosecution, through training, exchange of best practice and networking, involving especially law enforcement and judicial authorities, including prosecutors.
monitoring of online hate speech, especially those projects focusing on strengthening or setting up monitoring tools at national level
coordination and cooperation between national authorities and civil society organisations.
promoting diversity and countering discriminatory attitudes by police forces
providing respectful treatment, recognition and support of victims of hate crime.
General requirements:
Cooperation of different actors, including non-State actors such as civil society organisations is encouraged where relevant.
Cooperation with other existing projects in the EU should be properly ensured; outcomes of the past projects should be taken into account.
Proposals ensuring maximum practical benefits and impacts for the target groups will be more favourably assessed than projects consisting mainly of research and other analytical activities.
Proposals providing for conformity assessments of transposition of the above instruments into national law are not a priority of this call.
Proposals under all priorities must make provisions to document the number of persons/professionals reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by gender and by age and must describe in their grant application how this will be done.
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the applicant must describe the child protection policy it will adhere to (see Annex 4 )
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of children, parents, teachers/educators/guards/care staff reached, provide anonymised data
The following types of activities will not be funded by the Commission:
activities supporting individual political parties;
provision of financial support to third parties;
legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The restricted call for proposals is aimed at assisting Member States’ authorities in developing tools and practices to effectively prevent and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, and in particular hate crime and hate speech. The call is targeted at public authorities who bear a responsibility in implementing legislation and policies on preventing and combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, and in particular hate crime and hate speech. Projects involving law enforcement authorities and judicial authorities, including prosecutors, will be prioritised. Projects contributing to ensuring a more effective implementation of national provisions on hate speech and hate crimes, in particular those transposing the EU Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law, are of particular interest.
Increased support for national authorities also ties in with the work of the new EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, including dedicated work on assisting Member States developing a common methodology on recording and collecting data on hate crimes.
While proposals do not need to be transnational, the added value of projects involving organisations from more than one participating country is of particular interest.
The restricted call for public authorities will support:
- projects focusing on improving the effective investigation, prosecution and on ensuring the adequate sentencing of hate crime and hate speech cases;
- projects focusing on addressing underreporting and ensuring adequate support to victims of hate crime and hate speech;
- projects aimed at improving methodologies for recording and collecting data on hate crimes, also to contribute to enhanced comparability of Member States’ data and statistics;
- projects aimed at developing comprehensive strategies to prevent and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, including, where relevant, by focussing on specific grounds.
1.2. Description of the activities
In relation to the above mentioned priorities, the call will fund activities on:
mutual learning and exchange of good practices between Member States, with a view to build capacity and assist national authorities in replicating and adapting to different national contexts effective tools, measures and policies to address racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. Projects in this area should include a strong component related to ensuring transferability of practices and building capacity to ensure long-term sustainability;
development of tools and practices to improve responses to these phenomena, including but not limited to means of criminal law. This may include, for example, the development of protocols, practical toolkits, IT systems and programmes, educational material, trainings and action plans, aimed at supporting the work of competent authorities in the field of law enforcement and criminal justice, but also other relevant areas such as non-discrimination, education and culture, health, sport, social inclusion and integration, or a combination of these.
supporting victims of hate crime and hate speech and addressing the issue of underreporting, including trust building between communities and national authorities. Projects contributing to the effective implementation on the ground of relevant provisions of the EU Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime are of particular interest, including as regards victims' rights and awareness, access and referral to specialist victim support services and the individual assessment on vulnerability and specific needs. Projects aimed at improving reporting rates of hate crime and hate speech to the competent authorities are equally of particular interest, as well as projects focussed on improving and strengthening trustful relations and cooperation between national authorities (such as police, prosecutors, health authorities and educational personnel) and relevant groups or communities, including through the establishment of formal or informal agreements or partnerships.
capacity building and training activities, including but not limited to the area of criminal law. Projects in this area should be focused on the design and delivery or implementation of capacity building and training programmes, which may be addressed to public authorities and bodies across different areas of interest (such as justice, law enforcement, education and culture, health, sport, social inclusion and integration). In the area of criminal justice, areas of particular interest in this respect are: methodologies for recording and collecting data on hate crime and hate speech; investigation, prosecution and sentencing of hate crime and hate speech incidents; promoting diversity and countering bias and discriminatory attitudes; providing respectful treatment, recognition and support to victims of hate crime. In this respect, a reference to the key guiding principles on hate crime training for law enforcement and criminal justice authorities developed by the EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance will be an added value. Projects involving civil society organizations will be of particular interest, as well as projects fostering cooperation between different national authorities and bodies.
achieving strengthened cooperation and coordination between key actors (such as different national and/or local authorities, civil society organisations, targeted communities) through theestablishment or the development of multi-actor and multi-sectorial partnerships aimed at achieving relevant objectives related to better preventing and countering racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance (for example, monitoring and data collection, data sharing, awareness raising activities and campaigns, etc.).
1.3. Expected results
increased capacity of competent public authorities to effectively investigate, prosecute and adequately sentence hate crime and hate speech cases;
improved knowledge and awareness of competent public authorities of the impact ofracism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, and in particular hate crime and hate speech, of current trends and better understanding of the various forms of intolerance and of the legal framework, including rights of victims of hate crime and hate speech;
improved methodologies on recording and collecting data on hate crimes, and enhanced comparability of data and statistics across the EU;
strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent national authorities as well as other key actors such as civil society organisations and community representatives in the area of preventing and combating hate crime and hate speech;
development and implementation of comprehensive strategies to prevent and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, including, where relevant, by focussing on specific grounds;
improved support to hate crime victims, better awareness of the rights of victims of hate crime and hate speech and increased number of reported hate crime and hate speech incidents;
curbing manifestations of racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance across the EU, including incidents of hate crime and hate speech."

Public authorities bear the primary responsibility of ensuring an adequate response to racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance by designing and implementing laws, policies, tools and practices to prevent, counter and, where relevant, sanction their manifestations, in particular hate crime and hate speech, and ensure justice, protection and support for victims. This responsibility concerns first and foremost law enforcement and criminal justice authorities, including police, public prosecution authorities and the courts. Other public authorities, including those in charge of equality, non-discrimination, education, health or social welfare, have also a role to play to contribute making responses comprehensive and effective.
Against this background, this call is aimed at supporting projects by public authorities of the Member States, be it at national, regional or local level, aimed at preventing and combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, and in particular improving the authorities' responses to hate crime and hate speech, by:
- designing and implementing policy actions, action plans and strategies at national, regional or local level to effectively prevent and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance;
- developing tools and practices for the public authorities to achieve better implementation on the ground of relevant national legislation, in particular by ensuring effective identification, investigation, prosecution and sanctioning of hate speech and hate crime, and for enforcing the rights and ensuring a fair and adequate treatment of victims;
- improving recording and data collection on hate crime at national, regional or local level.
Projects contributing to the correct and full implementation of national legislation transposing the Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA on combating Racism and Xenophobia by means of criminal law are of particular interest.
Proposals are where relevant expected to build on the work of the EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance (http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item-detail.cfm?&item_id=51025).
Public authorities may decide to target projects to address the specificities of particular forms of intolerance, such as Antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred, homophobia and transphobia, antigypsyism, xenophobia and anti-migrant hatred, Afrophobia, hate crimes against persons with disabilities.
2. Description of the activities
In relation to the above mentioned priorities, the call will fund projects by public authorities of the Member States focused on one or more among the following activities:
- achieve better coordination and strengthened cooperation among public authorities and other key actors, including through the design and implementation of targeted policy actions, action plans and strategies and/or cooperation protocols and practices or the setting up and functioning of coordination bodies or entities involving different national and/or regional and/or local public authorities, civil society organisations, targeted communities;
- build capacity of public authorities, in particular law enforcement and criminal justice authorities, to be able to effectively investigate, prosecute and adequately sentence hate crime and hate speech cases and to adequately interact with victims and ensure respect of their rights through training activities, taking into account the key guiding principles on hate crime training for law enforcement and criminal justice authorities developed by the EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance (http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=43050);
- develop and set up tools and practices at national, regional or local level to ensure support and protection for victims of hate crime and hate speech, including through the development and strengthening of victim support services, the setting up of protection protocols, initiatives aimed at addressing the issue of underreporting and initiatives aimed at building trust between communities and public authorities, taking into account the key guiding principles on hate crime victims' access to justice, support and protection developed by the EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance (http://http//ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?doc_id=48874);
- build a solid system for effective recording and data collection on hate crime at national, regional or local level, building on the work of the EU High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance and in particular the key guiding principles on improving the recording of hate crime by law enforcement authorities (http://fra.europa.eu/en/news/2017/improving-recording-hate-crime-law-enforcement-authorities).
Mutual learning activities and exchange of best practices between public authorities of different Member States are welcome to be included in the proposals where this can bring an added value.
3. Expected results
Curbing manifestations of racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance across the EU, including incidents of hate crime and hate speech;
Development and implementation of comprehensive policy actions and/or strategies to prevent and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, including, where relevant, by focusing on specific grounds;
Strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent public authorities as well as other key actors such as civil society organisations and community representatives in the area of preventing and combating hate crime and hate speech;
Improved knowledge and awareness of competent public authorities of the impact of racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, and in particular hate crime and hate speech, of current trends and better understanding of the various forms of intolerance and of the legal framework, including rights of victims of hate crime and hate speech;
Increased capacity of competent public authorities to effectively investigate, prosecute and adequately sentence hate crime and hate speech cases;
Improved support to hate crime victims, better awareness of the rights of victims of hate crime and hate speech and increased number of reported hate crime and hate speech incidents;
Improved methodologies on recording and collecting data on hate crimes, and enhanced comparability of data and statistics across the EU."

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
One of the fundamental issues to tackle in order to reach gender equality is the persistence of gender stereotypes. From a very young age onwards, children are exposed to gender roles that shape their self-perception and influence their academic and professional choices as well as expectations of their roles as women and men throughout their life. Furthermore, gender stereotypes keep on influencing choices with regard to employment and combination of work and private life. Digitalisation can in this respect both offer opportunities and challenges to address gender stereotypes.
This call for proposals shall focus on actions in order to raise awareness and tackle gender stereotypes in education, in particular in early childhood education and care and in schools, and in educational and occupational choices in a digitalised world. Therefore, priorities shall be on:
1. Tackling gender stereotypes in education and early childhood care, focusing on measures such as those aiming at changing attitudes, behaviours and practices that hamper progress towards equality and restrict the potential of girls and boys. They shall target specifically childhood environments (kindergartens, pre-schools and schools), in terms of those who are delivering care and in the messages delivered, the choices of tools, pedagogical material, or the design of settings, etc.
One of the crucial elements is the awareness of professionals of the early childhood care and education sectors of their own unconscious bias affecting their interactions with boys and girls, and their active involvement in ensuring a gender-transformative environment for girls and boys and their families. Capacity-building and training activities are therefore encouraged.
2. Tackling gender stereotypes in educational and career choices in a digitalised world, focusing on the opportunities and challenges of ongoing digitalisation on tackling gender stereotypes. Particularly, on how digitalisation can benefit all students and workers/employees (e.g. new forms of work, upskilling for workers), to positively impact gender equality and to help break gender stereotypes. Furthermore, proposals shall address how the risks of reproducing gender stereotypes through digitalisation (e.g. algorithms, artificial intelligence) can be mitigated.
By combatting harmful negative gender stereotypes and discriminatory practices in education and early childhood care, and in addressing the potential and pitfalls of digitalisation on educational and professional choices, proposals are to impact positively on girls and boys perception of gender roles.
The call for proposals aims to raise awareness of gender equality issues from an early age, to fight differential treatment of girls and boys and of women and men according to gender assumptions in order to ultimately overcome gender stereotypes with regard to roles of women and men at home, at work and in society.
The call for proposals is in line with current policy developments at EU level, including the initiative on work-life balance for working parents and carers of April 2017, the Gender Pay Action Plan of November 2017 and falls under the first and second thematic priority areas of the European Commission Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019.
2. Description of the activities
Activities shall include:
1. Tackling gender stereotypes in education and early childhood care
- activities tackling negative attitudes and stereotypes with regard to gender roles in early childhood education and care systems, and educational and career choices;
- awareness-raising, education and empowerment activities; in particular awareness-raising activities for professionals of pre-school and school systems on an education, work and life free of stereotypes, including gender roles and attitudes towards domestic work, care, work and public life.
2. Tackling gender stereotypes in educational and career choices in a digitalised world
- activities focusing on the impact of digitalisation on career and professional choices, highlighting its opportunities and tackling potential hindrances as well as mitigating the risks that certain digitalised instruments bring about in intensifying gender stereotypes (e.g. gender bias through use of algorithms for recruitment procedures);
- exchange of good practice, mutual learning, seminars, in particular, activities promoting good practice examples;
- training activities for professionals of childhood care in the education sector and in the world of work; or with regard to overcoming gender stereotypes and roles in early childhood environments and in a digitalised world.
Support of public authority
It is strongly encouraged to involve a public authority, including regional and local authorities, to be actively participate in the projects. This support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application and will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
These public authorities can be: Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services), Ministries for children, child protection, social services, social protection, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, etc. The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project description and implementation.
To ensure complementarity with other EU funded actions, proposals may consider similar activities supported via other EU programmes such as the Framework Programme for research and innovation - Horizon 2020.
3. Expected results
gender stereotypes and negative gender roles are tackled, through awareness raising and training of those who are in daily contact with children, in early childhood education, care systems, schools and companies or bodies which foster educational and professional choices;
increased knowledge and practices are shared with regard to more informed educational and occupational choices in a changing world due to digitalisation;
both boys and girls and men and women develop their skills without stereotypes gender prejudices and feel more comfortable in an equal sharing of care and domestic work at household level, and they are able to develop their skills and training which will lead to less gender segregation in career choices and occupational choices.
* * *
Applicants are invited to take note of previously funded projects.[1] The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling-up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with one of the priorities. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission or referred to below (see bibliography). The degree of relevance to the priorities of the call for proposals will be assessed under the award criterion ‘a) relevance’.
Applying behavioural insights
Applicants are encouraged – wherever possible – to apply insights and practical tools from behavioural sciences in their projects in view of achieving changes in attitudes and behaviour. Below is a step-by-step approach to guide applicants in the incorporation of behavioural insights in their projects. For illustrative purposes, there are references included to examples related to gender-based violence in the footnotes, as this methodology has been developed and applied often in this context, though the same reasoning applies to other issues, such as tackling gender stereotypes in this context.
1) First, applicants should provide a clear description of the issue that will be tackled by the proposed action. If we consider attitudes and stereotypes with regard to education, educational and career choices , the description should specify the type(s) of behaviour (or attitudes) or practices (for instance s) that will be covered by the proposed action. Additionally, the objective(s) of the action should be clearly defined. These should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely (SMART) and should be set ahead of the action.
2) Second, the proposed action should identify the underlying determinants (also called behavioural causes)[1] of the issue at stake. This could be, for example, different expectations of teachers from girls and boys or from their mothers and fathers.. As the issues identified under point 1 likely have multiple underlying determinants, the proposed action could focus on several of these, or on only one. Each of the different underlying determinants the projects aims to tackle should be clearly indicated in the proposal.
3) Third, the proposed action should encourage a specific target group(s) to perform target behaviour(s)[2] or discourage them from doing so. Actions may aim, for instance, at changing girls and boys career choices (e.g. more girls in ICT, more boys in care, etc).
4) Fourth, once the target group(s), the underlying determinants and the target behaviour are identified, applicants should describe the solutions[3] (also called behavioural levers) that will be implemented. For example, if the proposed action aims at reducing the social acceptance of gender roles and gendered choices in life and in the world of work, the project could focus on changing social norms (if for example, awareness of indirect stereotypes in behaviour or expectation towards girls and boys, women and men) by for instance professionals dealing with the target groups as part of the intervention.
5) Fifth, the proposed action should specify the outcome that the proposed solution aims at generating and how the outcome(s) will be measured. Outcomes refer to impact, change in attitudes or behavioural change resulting from the action, and should not be confused with project outputs (e.g. number of leaflets published, number of people reached). If possible, projects should propose a measurable objective, compared to a baseline.. For example, if the goal is to change attitudes of a certain group of professionals, projects should not only measure how many attended training, but also ask them about their attitudes before and after the training. All interventions should include collection of relevant data, to be able to compare the situation before and after the project.
6) Sixth, to find out whether the proposed actions will have the desired effects, ideally the project should include a phase of pre-testing the solutions before implementing them in full-scale[4]. Such ex-ante assessment of the expected effect of the intervention will provide valuable insights on whether the proposed action has the intended effects and helps to ensure that, once fully deployed, the action focus is on what works. One possibility would be to use a randomised controlled trial.[5]
7) Seventh, the proposed action should include an evaluation of impact. Such evaluation should be part of the initial project plan, to make sure that the most appropriate evaluation design is used, and to set up valid outcomes measures (together with robust and feasible metrics) that allow the actual impact of the action to be determined. Several evaluation methods can be used such as after-only designs, before-after or pre-post designs, RCTs and field experiments.[6]
Mainstreaming
Projects funded under this call shall seek to promote equality between women and men. Gender mainstreaming means integrating a gender equality perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a project[7]. Gender mainstreaming entails incorporating a gender equality perspective in core activities and processes, to ensure that project outcomes support and promote equality between women and men. Gender mainstreaming is the responsibility of the actors normally involved in the project work. Consequently, the applicant shall take the necessary steps to ensure that gender equality issues are taken into account, throughout the project, by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men. Projects should promote equality between women and men, contribute to empowering women and ensure women enjoy the same rights as men, and do not discriminate either women or men.
Projects funded under this call shall also comply with the prohibition of discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ""Charter""), in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter. Among others the Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all its staff and team. The beneficiary is encouraged to foster an appropriate mix of people, whatever their ethnic origin, religion, age, gender and ability.
Finally, all projects under this call shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. (for further details please refer to ""Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers"", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion) – see bibliography. See also Turning the Curve: outcomes-based accountability in the bibliography.
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

[5]In case quantitative pretesting using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is carried out, this phase includes the identification of the most feasible randomisation unit (i.e., individual or group). For example, the initiative could be delivered in all universities of Region A (the treatment group), keeping the curriculum of universities of Region B (the control group) unchanged (randomisation at the group level). The inclusion of a control group and the use of randomisation allow the comparison of the outcome of in Region A against the outcome in Region B, hence determining whether the intervention was effective, all other things being equal. See « Test, Learn, Adapt » (UK BIT, 2012) for more information on this approach.

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
Dialogue and exchange of best practice will assist Member States and national practitioners in fostering tolerance and mutual respect including through the correct and full implementation of the provisions of the EU Framework Decision on combatting certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law, and in developing tools and practices to effectively prevent and combat bias-motivated crimes. Increased support in these actions also represents a follow up to the conclusions of the Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights of 1-2 October 2015 and reflects relevant priorities identified in the European Agenda on Security and in the conclusions of the Justice Ministers discussion on the justice response to the migration crisis, held at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 8-9 October 2015.
The priorities of this call for proposals are:
Grassroots projects on preventing and combating Antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred and intolerance (as a follow up of the 2015 Colloquium on Fundamental Rights event);
projects on preventing and combating homophobia and transphobia;
projects promoting the development of tools and practices to prevent (counter-narratives), monitor and combat online hate speech, including but not limited to means of criminal law (as a follow up of the Colloquium);
Projects to create better understanding between communities, including religious communities, and prevent and combat racism and xenophobia through interreligious and intercultural activities.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will fund activities on:
mutual learning on tolerance, respect and non-discrimination, exchange of good practices and strengthened cooperation between key actors, including representatives of the communities;
development of monitoring and transparency tools on hate crime and hate speech. In particular, projects should focus on developing tools to report and monitor online hate speech and/or enhancing transparency of the notifications made by users to the Internet companies and social media platforms will be a priority. Priority should be given to languages of the countries where the extent of the problem is considerable but no solutions are being genuinely developed;
capacity building and training activities for key stakeholders, including representatives of communities and youngsters;
dissemination, awareness raising activities and campaigns (e.g. production of counter and alternative narratives) aimed at preventing Antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred, xenophobic or anti-migrant sentiment, homophobia and transphobia and other related forms of intolerance.
supporting community leaders and local authorities to fight against racism, xenophobia and other related intolerance through community building, creation of networks, interreligious and intercultural dialogue, initiatives serving the community and boosting self-esteem, creativity and a sense of belonging, breaking of stereotypes and the developing of counter-narratives.
General requirements:
Cooperation of different actors, including non-State actors such as civil society organisations is encouraged where relevant.
Cooperation with other existing projects in the EU should be properly ensured; outcomes of the past projects should be taken into account.
Proposals ensuring maximum practical benefits and impacts for the target groups will be more favourably assessed than projects consisting mainly of research and other analytical activities.
Proposals providing for conformity assessments of transposition of the above instruments into national law are not a priority of this call.
Proposals under all priorities must make provisions to document the number of persons/professionals reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by gender and by age and must describe in their grant application how this will be done.
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the applicant must describe the child protection policy it will adhere to (see Annex 4)
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of children, parents, teachers/educators/guards/care staff reached, provide anonymised data.
The following types of activities will not be funded by the Commission:
activities supporting individual political parties;
provision of financial support to third parties;
legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The call is aimed at supporting projects contributing to prevent and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. Proposals under this call may explore the use of all available tools and forms of cooperation between national authorities, non-governmental organisations, communities and international organisations and bodies, and are encouraged to be developed on the basis of a holistic approach. While proposals do not need to be transnational, the added value of projects involving organisations from more than one participating country is of particular interest.
The call to prevent and combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance will support:
projects focusing on preventing and combating Antisemitism
projects focusing on preventing and combating anti-Muslim hatred and intolerance
projects focusing on preventing and combating xenophobia and anti-migrant hatred
projects focusing on preventing and combating other forms of intolerance, such as homophobia and transphobia (also as a contribution to the implementation of the Commission’s List of Actions to advance LGBTI equality, anti-gypsyism, Afrophobia, hate crimes against persons with disabilities
1.2. Description of the activities
In relation to the above mentioned priorities, the call will fund activities on:
mutual learning and exchange of good practices between Member States, with a view to build capacity and assist national authorities and practitioners alike in replicating and adapting to different national contexts effective tools, measures and policies to address racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. Projects in this area should include a strong component related to ensuring transferability of practices and building capacity to ensure long-term sustainability;
development of tools and practices to improve responses to these phenomena, including but not limited to means of criminal law. This may include, for example, the development of protocols, practical toolkits, IT systems and programmes, educational material, trainings and action plans, aimed at supporting the work of competent authorities in the field of law enforcement and criminal justice, but also other relevant areas such as non-discrimination, education and culture, health, sport, social inclusion and integration, or a combination of these. The involvement of relevant national authorities will be considered an added value in this context.

They need to be better integrated at institutional level to reach the critical mass that would enable the EU to be better positioned with regard to its main competitors.
Scope: Proposals should pool the necessary resources from national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint transnational call for proposals with EU co-funding on observing and monitoring changes affecting the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere and landscapes, with human activities being a major driver of these changes in the domain of climate, environment and resource efficiency.
The joint call should address the issue of the coherence of European participation within the Group on Global Earth Observation (GEO) and should also provide a research and innovation component to the Copernicus programme.  International European interest organisations[1] conducting research activities in the domain of Earth Observation, such as the European Space Agency, may participate in this ERA-NET.
The action is targeted at publically-funded research performing and business innovation support organisations. Their participation must be mandated by the national/regional authorities in charge (normally the responsible Ministry). The co-funded call for proposals must be based on in-kind contributions from their institutional funding and the beneficiaries will carry out the transnational projects resulting from their call for proposals fully or partially themselves. Exceptional cash contribution could be provided through this ERA-NET by international European interest organisations, resulting in grants to third parties and allowing a broader participation of researchers.
Expected Impact: In the short-term, reinforced European leadership within GEO post-2015. In the medium-term, effective coordination mechanism and integration of major European research and innovation Earth Observation programme as a contribution to Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and Copernicus. In the medium-term, significant improvement of shared Earth Observation architectural components and related information infrastructure, improved, open and unrestricted data sharing across borders and disciplines, and interoperability amongst observational, modelling, data assimilation and prediction systems to maximise value and benefits of Earth observation investments. Significant use of the GEO resources in decision making in the domains of climate, environment, resource efficiency and natural hazards.

","16 September 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Maximum benefit should be made of the investments made in Earth Observation data and information when developing terrestrial and marine ecosystem models and sustainable ecosystem services, in order to deliver major benefits to citizens, businesses and governments. To achieve this, there is a need to develop innovative solutions that will provide open and unrestricted access to interoperable ecosystem Earth Observation data and information. This demanding task is rendered more difficult by the still fragmented and limited ability to collect, store, integrate, analyse and share the required Earth Observations. Overcoming this challenge will contribute to assessing the status of our planet's biodiversity and developing sustainable ecosystem services and natural capital. 
Scope: Proposals should focus on recovering existing data, supporting new measurements and observations, synthesis and interpretation of data for making all information and knowledge available to scientists, policy makers, citizens and other concerned stakeholders to provide a full picture of the state and temporal evolution of ecosystems in existing internationally recognised protected areas. The scope of the action should include enhancing participation of all players in social and political decisions regarding the protection and management of key ecosystems and the definition of future protected areas. They should undertake pilot actions in selected protected areas to further develop the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and foster a knowledge base regarding ecosystem observations for the Copernicus (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) initiative.
Proposals should, as far as possible, include the participation of pan European organisations with a remit in the domain of Earth Observation in order to facilitate access to the necessary data for projects. Proposals should include coordination to avoid duplication with the ESA Climate Change Initiative, as well as measures to find synergies.  
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: By 2015 strong European support and leadership within the GEO Ecosystem tasks. Documented monitoring methodology to define ecological status of future protected areas. Significant contribution to the research requirement for the Copernicus operational services. By the end of the project: new prototype products and ecosystem services, based on improved access to (notably via GEOSS) and long-term storage of ecosystem Earth Observation data and information in existing protected areas, tested, evidence-based environmental policy making and administrative efficiency, and contribution to transparency in public administration and the provision of better public services concerning natural resources management. Improved evidence-based environmental policy making and political decisions.

Many countries are facing similar challenges in the field of mineral raw materials as the EU, including dependence on supply of raw material from international markets, shortage of knowledge on raw materials and their flows for decision making by authorities, industry, financial sector etc. Understanding of the global nature of raw materials value chains and ensuring sustainable supply of primary and secondary raw materials for the EU requires knowledge of materials flows at a global level and relevant skills. At present, there is a shortage of specialists in the EU in some areas related to primary and secondary raw materials production and raw materials markets. This is a challenge that needs to be addressed at the EU level together with the relevant countries around the world having expertise in the field. In addition, the global nature of raw materials value chains requires common approach and solutions at a global level in order to ensure fair and unrestricted access to raw materials worldwide. There is therefore a need for a more active involvement of the EU in relevant initiatives and closer collaboration with competent international organisations in the field of raw materials.
Scope:
Proposals should address one of the following:
a) Demand-supply forecast and raw materials flows at global level (2016): Proposals should develop a common methodology to mineral raw materials flows at global level which could be agreed and used at international level. As a pilot case, focus should be on critical raw materials and in particular the ones used in low-carbon technologies. The methodology should incorporate models on demand-supply forecast in order to allow for dynamic analysis of global materials flows. Proposals should provide recommendations and feed into future policy developments.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international co-operation is required with the US and Japan in the field of Materials Flow Analysis. Where appropriate, synergies with the relevant EU Member States initiatives are to be explored and fostered.
Proposals should build on the outcomes of the Study on Data Inventory for a Raw Material System Analysis and on related studies performed by the International Resource Panel.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Advancing the idea of a World Forum on Raw Materials (2016): With a view to contributing to the fair and unrestricted access to raw materials worldwide, this action should cover all the following points:
develop an EU-based platform of international key experts and stakeholders that would advance the idea of a World Forum on Raw Materials and enhance the international cooperation among G20 Member countries as well as the other third countries active in the mining and other raw materials sectors;
foster sharing of experience with a view to increasing understanding of all aspects of trade in raw materials and strategies to leverage natural resources for wider growth and development in close co-operation with the OECD to contribute to the OECD policy dialogue;
where appropriate explore and foster synergies with the relevant EU Member States initiatives;
identify common needs and threats, and develop and promote on international fora recommendations on possible actions to consolidate the efforts of the countries involved towards a more joint and coherent approach towards raw materials policy and investment;
involve relevant organisations, in particular OECD, International Study Groups, CONNEX, the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, UNEP Resource Panel, in the planned activities.
In line with the strategy for EU international co-operation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international co-operation is required, in particular with G20 Member countries as well as the other third countries active in the mining and other raw materials sectors, and international organisations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c) International network of raw materials training centres (2017): Proposals should create a self-sustainable long-term lasting international network of training centres for professionals. The proposals should involve educational and research institutions in the EU and the leading counterparts in third countries, based on specific country expertise in the primary and secondary raw materials sectors. The network should map skills and knowledge in the EU and the third countries, identify key knowledge gaps and emerging needs, develop roadmap for improving skills and knowledge, as well as establish common training programmes in the raw materials sectors.
In line with the EU's strategy for international co-operation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international collaboration is required. Where appropriate, synergies with the relevant EU Member States initiatives are to be explored and fostered.

","04 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
In order to accelerate users' uptake of open Earth observation (EO) data and information for the benefit of Europe, there is a need to develop a coordinated and comprehensive EO data exploitation initiative within the larger GEOSS landscape. The challenge is to demonstrate the effective use of European EO resources (including space, airborne, in-situ measurements and citizen observations) to prepare for operational environmental forecasting, and for mitigation and adaptation actions through building on Copernicus services and GEOSS initiatives and flagships.
Scope:
This action should be an application-oriented initiative, aimed at showcasing and promoting existing European 'GEOSS' actions and scaling them up to deliver services relying on existing strengths in Europe. The focus should be on a coordinated approach to promote collaboration amongst the GEO members and participating organisations within the European region. Based on the core use of a variety of data available within GEOSS, actions should scale up and develop a comprehensive suite of products, services or solutions delivering economic, social and policy value to European citizens, making use of state-of-the-art data integration and fusion techniques. This work should be performed in close collaboration with the European EO programme Copernicus and be in compliance with the INSPIRE Directive, and build on the European GEOSS Data Hub currently developed through the Horizon 2020 project NextGEOSS..
'EuroGEOSS' should also facilitate the access to and integration of untapped national in-situ Earth observation data with research-based data and different sources such as Copernicus, the European research infrastructures, citizen science initiatives and others, into user oriented applications. EuroGEOSS should focus on delivering information for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other GEO engagement priorities in a European context. 'EuroGEOSS' should further advance the GEOSS data sharing and Data Management Principles across Europe.
A plan for longer term sustainability (beyond the life of the project) of the applications developed through the 'EuroGEOSS' action should be elaborated in close coordination with the EuroGEOSS initiative of the European GEO caucus.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
delivering economic, social and policy value to European citizens through a comprehensive and coordinated suite of services;
a strengthened Earth observation capacity focused on the European region;
the strengthening and promotion of links between GEOSS and Copernicus, showcasing mutual benefits. This also includes European national contributions to and benefits from GEOSS;
the coordinated downstream data exploitation of European EO datasets available through the GEOSS (such as Copernicus data sets, data sets from the different European research infrastructures, citizen science initiatives, and national databases of in-situ observations).
coherent data management, through the use of GEOSS Data Management Principles and best practices (INSPIRE-compliant);
significant advances in Earth System Science modelling and downstream product development;

Proposals should be supported by the competent Minister, evidenced in a letter included in the proposal. In order to ensure high political and strategic relevance, the active involvement of the competent national authority/authorities will be positively reflected in the evaluation under the ‘impact’ criterion.
In agreement with the Commission services, projects should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.10 million and EUR 0.30 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately, depending on the size of the event (number of participants). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one action will be funded per Presidency (possibly covering more than one event).
Expected Impact:
The action is expected to result in:
improved visibility, in particular in the hosting country, of the areas covered by Societal Challenge 5;
identification of policy options and priorities via review and assessment of developments, and sharing of information and comparison of points of views;
efficient networking of various stakeholders and supporting their activities, e.g. natural scientists, social scientists, researchers, industrialists, investors, local authorities, environmentalists, museums and schools."

","Pre-Commercial Procurement
","08 November 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Soil contamination is typically caused by industrial activity, mining and smelting practices, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste and is increasingly becoming a very serious environmental and health problem. Member States are making efforts to establish national decontamination/remediation strategies which are generally very costly. It is therefore crucial for public authorities to be able to identify the most fit-for-purpose and cost-effective innovative solutions.
The challenge is to address the lack of public demand driven innovation in the soil decontamination sector in Europe. This is needed to close the gap between supply and demand for innovative solutions. Pre-commercial procurement (PCP) has the potential to be an effective demand side innovation action par excellence.
PCP enables a buyers' group (consortia of procurers) to procure research and development to create innovative solutions, speed up the time-to-market and provide best value for money.
Scope:
Launch of PCP – i.e. a joint procurement of research and development services – to find common innovative and sustainable solutions for soil decontamination/remediation, avoiding 'dig and dump'. The proposal is expected to bring radical and innovative improvements to the quality and efficiency of public soil decontamination services, processes and products.
The core of the consortium should be a qualified 'buyers group' (public procurement consortium), able to implement the action. Additional partners such as business/SME support organisations, innovation agencies or sectoral organisations may be included, to assist procurers in knowing what is available on the market through market consultations.
Proposals shall describe the jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into the mid-to-long-term innovation plans of the consortium, why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs, and put forward concrete targets for the desired functionality/performance improvement in the quality and efficiency of their public services. Activities shall include: (1) networking relating to preparation, management and coordination, (2) joint research activities relating to the validation of the PCP strategy and (3) activities for the follow-up of the joint procurement, such as activities for awareness raising, networking, training, evaluation, validation and dissemination of results. Proposals should explain clearly how the creation of jobs, economic growth and new businesses will be assessed as an integral part of the project.
The PCP should deliver successful innovative and fully tested product(s) and/or service(s) that meet the common needs of the buyers' group and that is therefore ready to be marketable. The final aim of the action is to develop innovative and fully tested solutions, which are fit-for-purpose and cost-effective, for soil decontamination/remediation.
Proposals should build on and take care to avoid duplication of the activities undertaken by the BRODISE project[1].
Project(s) should have a maximum duration of 2 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The funding rate for Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) actions is limited to 90% of the total eligible costs (PCP is procurement of R&D services) to leverage co-financing from the procurers.
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to contribute to:
deployment of innovative solutions to deal effectively with soil contamination that respond to the common needs and beyond state-of-the-art performance targets of the buyers group;
reduced fragmentation of demand for innovative solutions by enabling public procurers to collectively implement PCP in the area of soil decontamination challenges, which, due to their nature, are better addressed jointly, or which they would not have been able to tackle independently;
new opportunities for wide market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side through the use of joint specifications, wide publication of results and – where relevant – contribution to standardization, regulation or certification to remove barriers for introduction of innovations into the market;
creation of new products, processes and/or services ready for market uptake, leading to viable new businesses, jobs and growth;
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 3 ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’ and SDG 15 'Protection, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss'.

","Coordination and support action
","10 November 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Pre-commercial procurement (PCP) and public procurement of innovative solutions (PPI) are effective demand side innovation actions, since they enable public procurers to drive innovation from the demand side by acting as technologically demanding first buyers. This helps to improve the quality and effectiveness of public services and at the same time stimulates opportunities for companies to create, maintain or take international leadership in new markets.
Innovation-oriented public procurements (PCP and PPI) are key to fostering lead markets and generating a critical mass of demand for solutions and services addressing climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials challenges. Barriers to these kinds of public procurement include the absence of cross-border coordination and lack of access to best practices and to knowledge of close-to-market innovative solutions.
Scope:
Actions should prepare for PCPs and/or PPIs, which would be suitable for launching in 2018-2019. All areas covered by Societal Challenge 5 are eligible.
The action should deliver all the necessary elements in preparation of the PCP or PPI as described in part E of the General Annexes to this Work Programme.
Proposals should lead to the establishment of buyers' group(s) of public procurers to overcome the fragmentation of demand for solutions and services and to lead to a more rapid market uptake of such solutions and their early deployment. Procurements could address entire value chains in the areas(s) covered.
Proposals should engage public and/or private procurers from each country participating (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area(s).
The network(s) of public procurers/buyers' group(s) created should investigate the feasibility of, test and prepare the launch of joint or coordinated procurements (PCP or PPI), which would ultimately develop innovative, fully tested, fit-for-purpose and cost-effective solutions to address specific challenges in the areas covered by Societal Challenge 5. These solutions should be based on a complete set of common specifications.
Duplication with on-going activities should be avoided, namely the project(s) resulting from WASTE-5-2014 and SC5-26-2017.
Preparation activities for the joint or coordinated PCPs and/or PPIs will be supported, but not the costs of the procurement resulting from any PCP and/or PPI procedures.
Project duration should be 12 months.
Proposals may target delivery of more than one PCP and/or PPI.
The Commission considers that a contribution from the EU of around EUR 50 000 per procurement (PCP or PPI) investigated and prepared would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to contribute to:
creation of a critical mass of procurers of solutions and services in the area of Societal Challenge 5, which would be able to penetrate the market;
leverage of additional investment in research and innovation;
increased awareness and successful use of public procurement by procurers to boost innovation;
reduced fragmentation of public sector demand via creation of a network(s) of public procurers capable of collectively implementing PCPs and/or PPIs.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Nature-based solutions (NBS) have a high – but largely untapped – potential for delivering multiple ecosystem services (such as carbon sequestration, soil and water retention and purification, pollination, increased human well-being… ) to address diverse societal challenges with a systemic and innovative approach. An effective and self-sustainable multi-stakeholder platform that fosters dialogue, interactions, knowledge and information sharing, collaboration and think-and-do-tanks among relevant stakeholders is necessary to support the understanding and promote the use of nature-based solutions and speed up market up-take. Stakeholders include science, policy, administration, business (including SMEs), society (including NGOs, CSOs, and citizens as appropriate), public and private investors.
The establishment of such platform is currently being undertaken by ThinkNature[1], with support from Oppla[2] and Biodiversa[3]. ThinkNature is an ongoing CSA funded under SC5 WP 2016 that is due to terminate end 2019. The Oppla portal is developing as the EU NBS knowledge repository, supporting access, sharing and marketing of nature-based solutions knowledge, including from NBS EU-funded projects.
Scope:
The action should aim to build upon the achievements of ThinkNature and further develop and consolidate an effective and self-sustainable EU community of innovators and practitioners and think-and-do-tanks to promote the design, development, replication and upscaling of nature-based solutions at the European and global scale.
The action should, on the basis of continuous and strategically driven stakeholder dialogue, exchanges of practices and experiences and sharing of expertise related to the various social, economic, financial, environmental, educational, institutional, regulatory and cultural NBS-relevant aspects, across multiple scales (local, regional, national and EU):
further develop and maintain an online open source stakeholders platform that would facilitate the interactions;
develop a business plan to make such a platform financially self-sustainable;
identify specific domains and priorities where further research and innovation is needed for marketable nature-based solutions;
establish NBS hubs and organize communication and outreach campaigns and regular events in all Member States, involving, as appropriate, international networks and environmental communicators and targeting all relevant stakeholders involved, including the scientific community, in the overall NBS value chain;
facilitate the clustering of current and upcoming EU-funded nature-based solutions relevant research and innovation projects and other EU or national initiatives;
assist the European Commission in organizing science-policy workshops and drafting briefings and contributions to EU policies related to nature, environment, climate, water, etc. Appropriate links with other relevant policy platforms such as Climate-ADAPT[4] and BISE[5] should be ensured;
develop guidelines for practitioners with state-of-the-art NBS design practices, protocols and standards;
facilitate the development and mainstreaming of NBS-related professional training and the inclusion of NBS in high-education curricula (as, for example, NBS for architects and urban planners; ecosystem services for engineers, etc.), and Masters;
promote international cooperation with key strategic international partners[6];
proposals shall address all of the above points. The platform must ensure that all evidence, data and information will be accessible through the Oppla portal.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million for a period of up to 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to lead to:
effective and self-sustainable EU community of innovators, practitioners and think-and-do-tanks; identification of knowledge gaps and user needs; assessment of market potential for NBS;
enhanced awareness among public authorities, the private sector and society at large about the advantages and any risks of NBS and therefore a wider use of these solutions as opposed to or in combination with grey infrastructure;
improved cooperation and synergies with key strategic international partners and the emergence of a global market for nature-based solutions.

Impact is one of the keywords of Horizon 2020. The Horizon 2020 Regulation[1] establishes performance indicators aimed to facilitate and measure the overall impacts of the funded actions. The Work Programme 2014-2015 listed the expected impacts of each specific topic, which were used as criteria to evaluate proposals and select the projects to be funded. Nevertheless, despite this emphasis on impact, the overall performance indicators defined in Horizon 2020 are not sufficient to fully capture and assess the outcomes and impacts of projects; in particular in relation to innovation performance and its effects on resource efficiency, environment and climate change. In a context of tighter budgets and more public attention on the effectiveness of public funding and EU-funded research, there is a need to assess the performance, impact and effectiveness of actions funded by Horizon 2020.
Scope:
The action should assess the impacts of all the Research and Innovation Action (RIA) and Innovation Action (IA) projects funded by Societal Challenge 5 under the 2014-2015 Work Program through in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis (87 projects in total).
The action should apply an existing methodology, or develop a more suitable one, to measure and better understand the progress made by and achievements of these projects. The projects' impacts should then be compared with the expected impact statements in the Work Program for each of the relevant topics. Among others, the impacts assessed should include: state-of-the-art, knowledge creation, scientific progress and filling knowledge gaps,; impacts on environmental and climate objectives; support and contribution to the European policy targets; improving resource and energy efficiency; better air, soil and water quality; creation, implementation and deployment of technological and social innovative solutions; creation of new market opportunities; market and social up-take, replicability of innovative and sustainable technological and non-technological solutions; enhanced competitiveness; leverage of additional investment in research and innovation in green solutions; and contribution to the SDGs.
The assessed projects could achieve relevant impacts not explicitly mentioned in call text. For these cases the action shall identify and assess the additional impacts.
The proposals should identify the actions needed to achieve the impacts planned in the grants agreements of funded projects, as well as any barriers to their achievement. Best practices and recommendations for effectively and realistically enhancing the potential impact of actions funded by future work programmes should also be proposed.
The action should engage in active communication and promotion of its results, including a final dissemination workshop.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 0.6 million and with a duration of 12 months would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or duration.
Expected Impact:
the action is expected to contribute to:
maximising the impact of Societal Challenge 5 projects on environmental (including climate), social and economic objectives;
enhancing the outcomes of future Work Programmes, through a better understanding of the relationship between the Work Programmes and project impacts;

Scope:Today the standards are developed for specific components or areas such as smart meters, smart grids, ICT etc. With the development of integrated solutions of Smart Cities and Communities a system approach is needed. Furthermore through standardisation the solutions identified by smart cities and communities can envisage costs reductions. It is expected that this work is carried out by the industries cities and communities contributing to the Smart Cities and Communities European Innovation Partnership in cooperation with the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN, CENELEC, ETSI) as well as other Standard Developing Organisations (SDOs) responsible for technical specifications in the area of Smart Cities.  Social acceptance of developed solutions might be considered.
The process for developing smart cities and communities standards should ensure
interoperability of solutions, i.e. adaptability of solutions to new user requirements and technological change as well as avoidance of entry barriers or vendor lock-in through promoting common meta-data structures and interoperable (open) interfaces instead of proprietary ones;
open and consistent data, i.e. making relevant data as widely available as possible – including to third parties for the purpose of applications development – whilst using common, transparent measurement and data collection standards to ensure meaningfulness and comparability of performance/outcome measurements.

Performance measurements should consider the solution's impact on greenhouse gas emission reductions, improved energy efficiency and increased integration of RES into a city's energy mix. Moreover quantification of economic, and possibly even social, performance of the solution at hand has to be included to evaluate the potential value for money and consumer engagement. In short, key performance indicators are to be developed at least along the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability.
The work has to consider existing European initiatives such as the Reference Framework for sustainable Cities and the international dimension, notably the CityProtocol and ITU (International Telecommunication Union) initiatives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 to 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Involvement of society in data management processes of cities according to the value of information and improvement of level of trust of citizens.
Stimulate market for data-enabled services/solutions (supporting entrepreneurship).
Improved territorial knowledge for smart city planning.
Recommendations to policy makers for collecting new sources of data and possibly form the basis for policy recommendations for a 'smart city index'.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The EU policy and regulatory framework in the sectors of energy, transport and ICT supports the development of sectoral solutions, i.e. solutions with a limited degree of integration. However, for successful and accelerated implementation in real environments such as urban ones - that also have to take into account local specificities the test of integrated measures will pave the way for faster market roll-out of technologies. The key challenges for Smart Cities and Communities are to significantly increase the overall energy efficiency of cities, to exploit better the local resource both in terms of energy supply as well as through the demand side measures. This will imply the use of energy efficiency measures optimising at the level of districts, the use of renewables, the sustainability of urban transport and the needed drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas - within economically acceptable conditions - while ensuring for citizens better life conditions: lower energy bills, swifter transport, job creation and as a consequence a higher degree of resilience to climate impacts (e.g. urban heat islands effects) etc.
Scope:To identify, develop and deploy replicable, balanced and integrated solutions in the energy, transport, and ICT actions through partnerships between municipalities and industries.
These solutions at the intersection of the three sectors will have a holistic approach and are still facing first mover risk. These will be the lighthouse projects as identified by the Communication on Smart Cities and Communities. Lighthouse projects will target primarily large scale demonstration of replicable SCC concepts in city context where existing technologies or very near to market technologies (TRL 7 and more, see part G of the General Annexes) will be integrated in an innovative way.
The proposals should address the following main areas:
         (Nearly zero) or low energy districts: through the integration and management of: i) the supply of energy with predominant exploitation of local resources (e.g. waste heat, renewables, storage) and the active participation of consumers (e.g. use of aggregators); ii) the cost-effective refurbishment of existing buildings without significant disruption for tenants (use of sustainable materials) with a special focus on residential buildings  iii) the cross-cutting ICT solutions for the design and overall management of energy/ transport systems  
         Integrated Infrastructures: through the integration of physical infrastructures such as core networks, street scenes, lighting, industrial sites etc to create new forms of value through re-use and repurposing. This should lead to quantifiable benefits such as reduction of capital /operational expenditure as well as reduced carbon / energy footprints. This might also imply exploitation of synergies between requirements for smart grids, broadband infrastructures and in general poly networks (e.g. district heating and cooling).
         Sustainable urban mobility: through the integration of energy/ fuelling infrastructure with vehicle fleets powered by alternative energy carriers for public and private transport, including logistics and freight-distribution. Implications on energy management, and in the case of electromobility, the impact on the electricity grid, of the deployment of high numbers of vehicles and/or the alternative fuel blends performance must be assessed. 
The proposed proposals should address in addition to the main areas presented above a strategy that addresses appropriate enabler actions to support the commercial exploitation of the proposal. This includes (indicative list): commitment of authorities (even if changes of politicians/ majority, in the course of the project); citizens' engagement and empowerment; optimising policy and regulatory frameworks; open, consistent data and performance measurements; dissemination and unlocking the market potentials worldwide.
According to the Communication on Smart Cities and Communities the light house projects should look for creating partnerships between industries, academics and cities, empower citizens and ensure the replicability of the solutions, ensure the funding from various sources[1].
Therefore each project should:
Be realised in 2 – 3 cities or communities (light house cities or communities);
include industry, city planning authorities which should also reflect the view of the consumer organisations, research community, local Small and Medium Size Companies (SMEs);
In addition each project should co-involve 2 - 3 follower cities i.e. cities willing to contribute to the process though the replication of solutions at the end of the project and having access to the knowhow and results of the project and a privileged contact with the project's partners. The involvement of the follower cities should be relevant (e.g. participating in definition of user requirements and methodology of transferability of solutions, data collection etc.).  The follower cities should aim at improving their energy performance or the share of use of renewables (e.g. 60% reduction of primary energy for buildings, 20 - 30 % RES use for electricity as well as for heating and cooling). EU geographical coverage conditions should be also applied. The quality of the work programme of follower cities will be part of the overall evaluation.
Ensure that all proposed activities are a part of ambitious urban plan. These activities should also lead to the development of integrated urban plans. For the lighthouse cities or communities these plans should be finalised before submission of the proposal (e.g. those compiled for the Covenant of Mayors, Sustainable Energy Action Plans, plans committed under the Green Digital Charter etc., but without limiting to this list of initiatives). The urban plan shall integrate buildings planning, energy networks, ICT, transport/mobility planning; additional issues may be addressed as well if relevant for the city. These plans shall be submitted with the proposal as a supporting document(s).
In order to ensure the success of the lighthouse projects, the funding for the other parts of the programme or initiative in which the lighthouse projects are embedded should be secured from other sources, preferably private ones, but also other EU funding sources (European Structural and Investment (ESI) funds for example), national or regional funding.
Projects should demonstrate and validate attractive business plans that allow large scale replication of fast economic recovery in cities of varying degrees of economic conditions (from very poor to very rich), varying sizes but significant urban areas  and varying climatic conditions to ensure high impact and replication potential.
The industrial partners and municipality authorities should engage in replicating successful demonstration in their own and other cities, notably 'follower cities'; the replication plans are compulsory and are part of the evaluation.
Consortia must have a clearly defined structure with roles and responsibilities properly spelled out for all involved entities for lighthouse cities and for follower cities.
Besides economic sustainability, proposals must also commit to scientific and technical requirements in support to reliability:
Open and consistent data and interoperability of solutions in order to avoid locked –in customers.
Contribution to common data collection systems (e.g. as those developed by European Commission under SCC2 of this Work Programme), measurement and disclosure methodology, in order to facilitate a common footprint calculation methodology and other metrics (especially for energy saving; CO2 reductions, financial savings, number of jobs created, environmental impact etc.).
The performance monitoring should last for a period of at least 2 years. Longer term commitment (e.g. 5 years) will give an added value to the proposal. Consortia should develop an integrated protocol for monitoring energy, infrastructure, mobility and governance practices in the lighthouse projects, enabling documentation of improved performance over short and long term periods. The monitoring protocol should be robust and viable also after the end of the project, supporting and increasing municipal capacity over time Participants may be asked to introduce performance data into existing data bases (e.g. CONCERTO technical monitoring data base).
The grant will be composed of a combination of the reimbursement of eligible costs, and flat rate financing determined on the basis of unit costs[2] only for the building-related demonstration activities.
The building components of the proposals will be supported through the unit cost/m⊃2;.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 18 to 25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposals are expected to have the impacts described below:
deploy wide-scale, innovative replicable and integrated solutions in the energy, transport, and ICT;
trigger large scale economic investments with the repayment of implementation costs in acceptable time lines (to facilitate the bankability of the projects);
increase the  energy efficiency of districts and of cities and foster the use of renewables and their integration energy system and enable active participation of consumers;
increase mobility efficiency with lower emissions of pollutants and CO2;
reduce the energy costs;
decarbonise the energy system while making it more secure and stable;
create stronger links between cities in Member States with various geographical and economical positions through active cooperation.
It is envisaged that the proposals will also bring societal benefits:
reduction of energy bills for all actors and especially for citizens and public authorities;
Increase quality of life by creating  local jobs (that cannot be delocalised) in cities;
Increase air quality.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems are the building blocks on which air traffic management operates. Despite many activities in the CNS domain there remain a number of areas where more research is needed. This topic looks at CNS for GA.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 1.2 topic c).
The GA community is large and operates a wide variety of aircraft types, ranging from para-gliders costing under 2,000 € to multi-engined aircraft costing several million Euros. As CNS technologies become more complex to support the needs of the commercial aviation community, the GA community can find it hard or impossible to afford the many complex certified systems that are being developed. One possible solution is to allow smaller non-certified technologies, developed specifically to be used by the GA community, to be used alongside the more-expensive full specification, certified devices.
Scope:
Research projects are expected to propose ideas for combining existing on-board, new and evolving technologies and ground equipment for enhancing CNS capabilities for GA and rotorcraft. The target community for this research is at the lower end of the capability, where many operators are private with a real need for low-cost devices. Ideas should include not only technological issues, but also how use of such equipment could be enabled through an appropriate measure of standardisation, certification and regulation.
Research ideas shall address CNS solutions for GA and rotorcraft communities, which are combined due to the similar needs for miniaturization and integration capabilities. However, it should not be assumed that all ideas will be appropriate for both communities, and differences, where identified, should be clearly addressed.
Applicants are free to select areas of research, but the following ideas are presented to stimulate thinking:
In the communication domain, 3G and 4G (and maybe 5G) mobile telecommunications networks could be used to deliver a low-cost data link capability to enable flight, aeronautical and meteorological information to be shared with the pilot in flight.
In the navigation domain innovative research ideas, concepts and technologies for small aircraft are needed as a suitable back-up/continuity system for GNSS (e.g. affordable inertial systems and use of ‘other’ signals (signals of opportunity) for navigation integrity). The options for advanced alternative PNT systems should also be considered.
In surveillance, ADS-B is being widely adopted, and benefits to pilots and ATC are clear. However, take-up in the GA community is low, mostly due to the cost of certified GNSS units and transponders. Projects could investigate how non-certified units could be used to provide the benefits to the GA community and to ATC, at a reasonable cost, without adversely affecting other airspace users or the wider ATC environment.
GA pilots sometimes lack the training and experience of their professional counterparts, and so the introduction of an array of new technologies and displays into the cockpit has the potential to distract the pilot from his/her primary actions. Such information-overload, from new displays such as traffic situational awareness, moving-map displays or data link terminals, could introduce a safety hazard by distracting the pilot from his/her visual traffic scan or from monitoring the primary flight instruments. The project shall also research the safety impact in terms of human factors associated with the introduction of new low-cost devices into the GA cockpit.
Applicants must demonstrate a good understanding of airborne aspects of GA operations and ATC. In addition, they must possess a good technological understanding of the technologies being researched and, where appropriate, spectrum management. Finally, applicants shall demonstrate a good understanding of standardisation, certification and regulation in the aviation domain.
The research activities shall cover the full picture. This includes development of the concept of operations, participation in periodic meetings, production of all the documentation related to the research (most notably including the project management plan and the final report), and results dissemination and communication activities. The demonstration report shall include a full analysis of operational, technological and regulatory issues for each technology researched. Recommendations for standardisation and regulation should be made, and anticipated difficulties should be highlighted.
Expected Impact:
There is a risk that, as the aviation environment becomes more complex and CNS technologies advance, GA operators could be priced out of the market, or their activities could be restricted by not being able to integrate with more advanced aviation stakeholders and environments. This research will help to narrow the gap, ensuring continued safe and unrestricted operations by the GA community."

The current state of the art CNS systems are the result of very slow process where products have performed small incremental evolutions across the years. This process led to an important technological gap between what is implemented in the ATM domain and what is currently available in the public domain.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 1.2 topic d).
Projects should investigate ways to brake this cycle and introduce innovative and disruptive technologies that, when applied to the CNS ATM domain could unlock unforeseen possibilities for the community. The investigated solutions should be compatible with the aviation requirements in terms of safety, security etc.
Scope:
Projects are expected to propose ideas for combining existing on-board and ground equipment for enhancing CNS capabilities. Solution for integrated CNS solutions and the implications of having one technology performing the three services at the same time can be studies (single point of failure..).
In the communications domain future innovative data-link technologies (e.g. high-bandwidth) for ATM going well beyond current ATM developments and taking into account research and development outside ATM should be studied. This should include technology options suitable for the airport domain, continental airspace and oceanic and remote areas (including high latitudes and polar region). Research proposals are expected to address the research issues related to resistance/prevention to jamming and spoofing.
In the navigation domain innovative research ideas for advanced alternative PNT systems should be considered. Furthermore the transition from barometric to geometric (GNSS) altitude for collision avoidance issues can be studied. In addition the re-examination of both vertical and horizontal separation practices are needed in the light of improved navigation accuracy (better than declared RNP performance).
In surveillance domain research projects can address the Surveillance Performance analysis and Quality of Services (QoS) leading to a “performance based surveillance” approach that facilitates adoption of new technologies. Furthermore, research ideas are needed in the assessment of future role of non-cooperative technologies with global coverage (e.g. satellite-based, etc.) for ATM.
Expected Impact:
This research will demonstrate and quantify the potential for CNS developments to improve the efficiency and performance of the ATM system at many levels. Successful research in this topic will have the potential to generate high positive benefits for ATM in terms of resource efficient and fit-for-purpose CNS capabilities as well as improvements in security."

The architecture of the overall ATM system is vast and complex; it has evolved piecemeal over many decades with no single ‘design authority’. Introducing change into this system is often difficult since it needs to take into account the many tight interdependencies that exist across the technical subsystems together with incumbent operational and institutional frameworks. A consequence of this situation is the difficulty to know the full implications of introducing change in any part of the system or on the system as a whole. Failure to properly understand this could mean that changes are introduced that result in uncontrolled system-wide degradation. This could be a particular concern with the increasing dependence on automation.
The challenge is therefore to better understand and model how architectural and design choices influence the ATM system and its various behaviours. This may be done using existing or novel approaches from systems analysis, architecture or complexity science.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 1.2 topic e).
Scope:
Proposals for research activities on ATM system design and architecture may start by capturing the characteristics of today’s system, using an existing or novel method, to then analyse and propose evolutionary approaches aimed at guaranteeing its robust transition towards the future.
Proposals may also take a ‘clean sheet’ approach, exploiting the benefits of an unconstrained perspective. In either case it may be possible to learn lessons from other industries that have used new devices such as, for example, participatory design.
Research projects may propose innovative ideas for ATM system design incorporating flexibility, agility and resilience applying formal mathematical approaches at early phases of system design, or for modelling change. Furthermore, research projects may seek to provide a better understanding of the degree of coupling (loose/tight) among the different ATM subsystems, the nature of these interdependencies and their impact on the overall ATM system. New approaches should normally build on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, with multiple service levels and tailored service provision. Agility should allow the ATM system to scale and adapt to meet different requirements for different times and places. Projects may also investigate the potential use of open-source and commercial off the shelf solutions. Finally, new designs should take into account security threats.
Harmonized infrastructure is a prerequisite for developments such as virtual centers and for the possible opening of the ANS market. Research projects may assess the potential benefits, analyse how the harmonization could be introduced through regulation, incentives and EC grants. It should address transition and standardization aspects as well as the restructuring of ANS and associated cost.
Projects should be careful not to spend time re-doing previous work on architecture that has been done in SESAR or elsewhere.
Expected Impact:
This research will support the ATM industry in better understanding the needs and challenges of developing a harmonised technical infrastructure for ANS, including its operational and economic impacts. Projects may demonstrate through examples and case-based arguments the potential of architecture in providing suitable means of assurance for validation or evidence to support decision-making and strategic thinking. Or the research projects may seek to provide a better understanding of the degree of coupling (loose/tight) among the different ATM subsystems, the nature of these interdependencies and their impact on the overall ATM system."

Keeping aircraft separated from each other is one of the core functions of ATM. In the SESAR concept, ground automation supports air traffic controllers in their task of providing separation management. Separation management starts by strategically limiting the density of potential separation conflicts (i.e. limiting traffic density and traffic complexity), but is ultimately ensured tactically by keeping aircraft separated at or above the pre-defined separation minima. The tactical separation minima are defined for each surveillance environment, and are essentially the same as they were decades ago.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 1.2 topic a).
The exploratory research challenge is to hypothesize and test a set of conditions in which lower tactical separation standards may be safe within the current surveillance environment. Any newly proposed separation scheme needs to be assessed against the risk of collisions and the probability of disruptive wake vortex encounters.
Scope:
This is an applications-oriented research topic. Proposals submitted for this topic should clearly formulate a hypothesis that tactical separation minima can be reduced below current minima under a specific and clearly defined set of conditions without safety being degraded, and explain what their rationale is.
Even though this topic is not addressing collision avoidance, it is expected that a collision-risk assessment must be conducted whenever a reduction of separation minima is considered. It is also expected that wake-encounter risk assessments be carried out in support of any proposed reduction to the minima. Project proposals should explain whether they will conduct the wake-encounter risk assessment, the collision risk assessment, or both, explain the rationale for their proposed approach and describe the methodology that they will use for collecting input data and for conducting the analysis. The proposal must also explain the validation techniques they plan to use in their research. It is expected that the validation techniques include any of the validation techniques that are commonly used for concepts at low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), including expert groups, and model based validations. Innovative validation approaches may also be proposed. The objective of the project will be to either confirm or reject their hypothesis.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential areas for research:
The use of Time-Based Separation (TBS) on final approach has already been validated in SESAR. In headwind conditions TBS are lower than Distance Based Separation (DBS) thus maintaining capacity that would otherwise be reduced. At higher altitudes, winds are usually stronger, which may result in a larger difference between TBS and DBS than in final approach. Exploratory research projects may analyse the potential benefits of defining TBS minima in environments other than final approach. Research into the use of TBS may include the definition of speed-based minima (i.e. separation minima as a function of aircraft speed), potentially considering the higher resistance to wake vortex of slower propeller-powered aircraft.
Current tactical separation minima are defined either as a lateral or as a vertical minimum. Exploratory research projects may investigate the possibility of defining separation minima that combine lateral and vertical minima. Combined separation minima would specify lateral and vertical separation minima that are individually below the existing vertical and lateral minima, but when attained simultaneously are as safe as current minima (e.g. in an environmment where aircrafts are currently separated 5NM laterally or 1.000 ft. vertically, separate them X NM laterally and Y feet vertically, with X less than NM and Y less than 1.000 ft.).
The concept of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) brings with it the capability of clearly defined and predictable navigation performance. Projects may investigate the contribution that PBN and the associated navigation applications, specifications and technologies could make to the revision of separation minima (e.g. by reducing applicable minima when two aircraft are known to be established on tracks that they will conform to as per a specific
RNP value).
Expected Impact:
Applications-oriented projects in this topic are expected to contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of how separation minima can be reduced without compromising safety. The reduction of separation minima will allow for an increase of airspace capacity, which is one of the key objectives of the SESAR programme."

The sharing and management of trajectory information provides consistent information which allows the use of each flight’s agreed trajectory as a unique, common reference for decision-making. In a trajectory-based environment, the starting point for a flight’s agreed trajectory is the Extended Flight Plan (EFPL) that has been accepted by the NM and distributed to all concerned Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP). The agreed trajectory is the trajectory that the Airspace User (AU) agrees to fly and the ANSP agrees to facilitate, and it is used as the basis of the tactical prediction of traffic demand. However, in Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO) constraints on the flight trajectory are not systematically applied unless it is necessary to do so to fulfil an Air Traffic Management (ATM) function (i.e. separation, arrival sequencing, etc.). For this reason, the agreed trajectory is not a 4D contract that the AU is expected to adhere to within specific tolerances, and when a deviation larger than a pre-defined value is detected the agreement will be automatically updated. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature of the ATM system, the ANSP may be unable to facilitate the trajectory as agreed; in such cases a Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) revision process will be triggered. The uncertainty over how the agreed trajectory will be executed is translated into an uncertainty on the prediction of the volume and complexity of traffic demand that is used as the basis for DCB.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 1.2 topic b).
The exploratory research challenge is to explore how the two types of uncertainties associated with the agreed trajectory (AU-originated uncertainty and ATM-originated uncertainty) affect the quality of the prediction of traffic demand, and how their impact on the quality of the predictions and on the effectiveness of DCB processes may be mitigated.
Scope:
This is an applications-oriented research topic. Consortia applying for this topic shall formulate a new operational improvement in their proposal, explain the rationale for their expectation that it will provide benefits, and develop how the project would perform an initial validation of their proposed concept. It is expected that the validation techniques include any of the validation techniques that are commonly used for concepts at low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), including expert groups, and model based validations. Innovative validation approaches may also be proposed.
The research may propose new prediction models and metrics for better understanding current and predicted traffic patterns. For example, projects may develop methods for the continuous and automatic monitoring of post-operations data in order to identify where the quality of the prediction of demand is affected by divergence between the trajectories that were actually flown from the trajectories that were agreed, and possibly identify patterns that allow the anticipation of where new divergences may happen in the future and derive correction factors that will allow an improvement in the quality of the predictions.
Projects may also propose new methods for using trajectory data for evaluating the complexity of a particular flight-list in order to improve the prediction of controller workload, and explore new concepts for Short Term Air Traffic Control Flow Management Measures (STAM) for fine-tuning the agreed trajectories in order to limit complexity or in order to bound specific uncertainties with the objective of improving the quality of the prediction. Projects may also develop innovative TBO processes for modifying already agreed trajectories in order to solve a demand and capacity imbalance, or consider how TBO processes can support innovative dynamic sectorisation concepts.
Expected Impact:
The research will contribute to the improvement of the effectiveness of DCB processes in a trajectory-based environment. This will have a positive impact on the safety and cost-efficiency of the ATM system."

Increasing the Automation in ATM is considered as a key to significantly improve ATM performance. However, ATM is a continuous 24-7 set of services where the complexity of the ATM system, its fallback modes and necessary recovery steps has proved to be a major challenge for the introduction of further automation, and this has consequently slowed down the advancement of automation in ATM, especially in the most congested areas of Europe. The latest progress in the domain of Artificial intelligence and in particular Machine Learning may open new possibilities for further automation in ATM in high-density operations and some new applications have already been developed in SESAR.The application of Machine Learning for Automation in ATM also comes with new challenges, including sound assurance arguments that need to be solved to avoid a negative impact. In particular safety, business continuity and cyber security issues need to be proposed at an early stage of development of the automation concept.
One challenge of increasing automation is related to transparency of the automated system. Any automated assistance system needs to be able to provide the human operator with all information necessary to enable an understanding of the reasons for its behaviour and/or decisions. Otherwise the system may not be accepted or trusted by the operator, thus negating the theoretical benefits of the automation.
Another challenge is the Generalization of results from Machine Learning methods. Differences between the data used for training and the data feed to a trained algorithm can lead to unexpected results, including that not all situations can be anticipated during the training. Additionally, due to this behaviour, the system might not be able to adapt to changes of behaviour of other actors that could
not be anticipated during the training of the system. In order to certify systems based on Machine- Learning, methods are needed to demonstrate that in delegating the control to these system sufficient assurance can be provided that it does not raise safety risks beyond what can be mitigated by other measures. Moreover, concerns have been raised that this behaviour may add uncertainty or unexpected behaviour to the ATM system.
Scope:
Proposals should select a specific ATM operational environment, present a vision of a higher level of automation in this operational environment (which may include the delegation of control to the automation) and address one or more of the specific challenges above that hinder the application of machine learning methods for the further automation of ATM (e.g. Transparency, Generalization). Proposals should aim at providing a better understanding of this challenge(s) and investigate innovative methods to address the(se) challenge(s) in ATM. Proposals may make assumptions about the availability of technology and/or operations enablers (e.g. data link), but need to state them clearly. This topic covers ground and airborne automation that impacts ATM.
Projects addressing the Transparency of automated systems incorporating machine learning methods required for cooperative human machine systems should identify which information needs to be provided to enable the human operator to cooperatively work together with the automation. Based on the identified information requirements, the project should select or develop and assess suitable machine learning methods for ATM automation that are able to provide these kind of information and assurances. The project may investigate the applicability of methods from the domain of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).
Projects addressing the Generalisation and the adaptation of the algorithms to changes in the operational environment, should investigate methods to estimate and increase the ability of an automated systems to handle a situations that were not foreseen during the development and training. These methods should enable automation to adapt to changes of the environment, like the change of behaviour of some actors (e.g. modification of operational procedures), the entrance of new actors or unforeseen traffic or weather situations. Projects may explore the possibility to apply algorithms able to learn during operation in order to adapt to optimise operations based on changes in the environment. Projects may also investigate the effects of uncertainty added to operations by these new methods.
Research activities may take aspects related to certification into account as required. However, this shall not be the primary focus of research in the proposal as this will be addressed in topic SESAR-ER4- 09-2019.
Proposals can also suggest to address other challenges of applying AI machine learning for ATM Automation other than these mentioned above if justification is provided.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to provide principles that could enable higher levels of automation that are predicted to lead to an improvement of ATM performance, in particular cost efficiency, capacity and safety."

According to the SESAR vision outlined in the European ATM Maser Plan, advancing the automation in ATM is the key to significant performance improvements across many aspects of ATM and development and implementation of higher levels of automation will enable handling the predicted increase in air traffic demand and contribute significantly to achieving the SES High-Level Goals.
The ATM system is currently designed to rely upon relatively high levels of human intervention to manage the air traffic safely and efficiently. This role of the human is being challenged and it is expected to change towards more of a supervisory role yet also maintaining the human as a critical and an integral element of the ATM system. Experience from ATM and other domains shows that increased dependence on automation makes it important to consider automation failure scenarios, system resilience and the challenge of maintaining a skilled and competent workforce. There will be a need to assess the human performance issues for ATC in a similar way to those that are known to affect flight-crew performance in the glass cockpit. These include the need to prevent the risks associated to moving the human operator into a monitoring role: stress, lack of attention, loss of situational awareness and de-skilling.
A promising approach to preventing these issues is to progressively evolve the ATM system into a Joint Human Machine Cognitive System following an integrated design that optimises the collaboration of actors in view of optimising system performance. Development and implementation of higher levels of automation will require careful consideration of the strength of human and automation systems as well as the identification of new human roles in parallel with the development of ATM concepts and use of technology.
Scope:
Proposals for research in this area should target an ATM system with a medium to high level of automation in which the human operator is working cooperatively with advanced automation as a digital assistant. Both, ATM-related airborne and ground systems are in scope.
Research may address human performance aspects related to higher levels of automation (i.e. stress, lack of attention, de-skilling, complacency…) and resilience, e.g. by developing new approaches for defining suitable task allocation strategies enabling a cooperation of ATCOs and/or other ATM actors and automation. This may include the use of adaptable or adaptive automation concepts. Projects may in particular focus on potentially required hand-overs between automated systems and human operators as well as handovers between human-human and machine-machine in normal and degraded modes of operation. These new approaches may build upon the existing legacy and SESAR solutions in the pipeline, or they could take a clean-sheet approach to automation. These proposals should validate the proposed design of ATM systems automation, focusing of expected future roles and procedures. They may consider approaches focusing on the front-end of automation and using a human to operate the automation in the background (e.g. Wizard-of-Oz approach) or even use a predefined reaction of the automation.
Proposals may also address the implications of the expected future role of the human and the foreseen introduction of new support tools on training requirements and develop appropriate training concepts. Projects are encouraged to take into consideration the opportunities enabled by the current advancement of technology for the design and delivery of training.
Proposals may also focus on specific aspects of these new systems. For example, proposals may investigate the application of psychophysiological measurements like neurometrics or the detection of facial expressions for applications like stress management systems, fatigue declaration, new training techniques or adaptive automation. Proposals may also consider to investigate potential application of activity trackers available on the consumer market. Proposals planning to investigate the application of psychophysiological measurements need to propose a specific application within the ATM system.
Proposals addressing this topic should not only consider normal operating situations but also take into account system failures and degraded modes of operation. This requires identification of system failure states and definition of appropriate procedures.
Proposal addressing this topic should take into consideration the results of SESAR WP-E projects, in particular HALA!, and ER1 projects (AUTOPACE, MINIMA, STRESS). Under this topic, there is also substantial scope for learning from other transportation modes and other industries and it is expected that proposals will build upon an established body of knowledge and apply this into the challenges of ATM.
Expected Impact:
The concepts for Joint Cognitive Human Machine systems and/or innovative Training concepts developed in these research are expected to enlarge the body of knowledge that is needed to make it possible to safely introduce higher levels of automation in ATM, which should provide substantial benefits for capacity and cost-effectiveness, safety and security of ATM operations."

Due to the rapidly developing techniques of data science it is possible to analyse large data sets and to detect new correlations and relationships. In fact, data science techniques are already having a huge impact in many application areas. The application of innovative methods of data science in the ATM domain could provide new insights to measure and improve the performance of the ATM system.
Scope:
Proposals should select data-driven methods that allow to identify so far unknown patterns, correlations or even cause-effect relationships in ATM data or allow for improved predictions on different levels (e.g. trajectories, sectors, and network). Proposals may suggest to use model-based approaches as a complement to data-driven methods, including a ‘data-twin’ representing reality.
Research activities should consider potential sources of uncertainty (e.g. partial observations, inaccurate information, incomplete knowledge inherent random nature, etc.) and their impact on the potential conclusions. Research activities may aim to provide improvements to the whole data workflow including data acquisition, cleaning, processing, and analysis.
Research activities addressing this topic should aim at providing new insights into the performance of the ATM system and investigate how the findings can be used to support strategic or real-time decision making in order to improve ATM performance. They should develop specific case studies and aim to identify actionable indicators or develop innovative visualisation techniques for complex data to support decision making.
As a part of their activity, projects may also define and make available standardised data-sets for training statistical models and a 'gold standard' (e.g. best theoretical classification of input data).
For example, proposals could offer to study how data science can be used to provide new insights into optimising airspace management (e.g. sector design and configuration, demand and capacity balancing, separation management), for example by studying delay sinks and amplifiers.
In case research activities investigate safety critical applications, potential safety issues (determinism, certifiability, etc.) raised by the selected method must be addressed.

Due to the increasing Digitalisation of ATM, more and more data is being recorded and even more data will be recorded in the future. This data could be used to improve operations e.g. by creating a common situation awareness among stakeholders and support their collaborative decision making towards measuring and communicating about ATM performance attributes, safety, security etc. and contribute more efficient organisation of the entire mobility system. Additionally, data can be used for research and development purposes, like comparing new concepts with current operations. However, there is historically some technical barriers and reluctance to make data available to other stakeholders for various reasons, e.g. concerns regarding the costs of making data available, insights into business decisions that may be revealed or lack of knowledge how data can be shared while protecting privacy.
The challenge is to overcome the barriers for the benefit of stakeholders and the ATM system as a whole.
Scope:
Proposals should develop innovative concepts supporting and simplifying storing, cataloguing and sharing of data between stakeholders and address this from different perspectives: operational, technological, economical and legal. Different types of data could be considered, e.g. operational data, performance data or safety data.
Research activities should identify the benefits that could be achieved by sharing data between stakeholders. They should investigate which technological solution should be used and which architecture would be appropriate for a potential platform to allow for a cost-efficient and secure provision of data. Proposals should explore potential business models of making data available taking into account the related costs of preparing and proving data and the ownership of date.
Proposals may also investigate the need for regulations for generating, distributing and exploiting ATM data (i.e. enforcing more open data). Additionally, they may investigate concepts for allowing the use of private data while respecting the confidentiality of the data sources, i.e. the usage of secure computation methods and other cryptographic approaches that allow data to be processed without disclosing the information (e. g. zero- knowledge outsourced computation).
Research activities could also investigate how data could be made available for research and third-parties and would allow prototyping of innovative data-driven applications.
Proposals should investigate one or several use-cases. For example, proposals may investigate sharing of operational data like planned and historical runway configurations, LIDAR readings on final approach, STARs in use, sector configurations, AMAN and DMAN planned time or radar data. Proposals may also investigate how performance relevant data could be shared across stakeholders and with the general public to communicate and increase the awareness of ATM performance.
Proposals may also focus on accident and incident data, study the availability in different European states and other counties and investigate how the availability of this data could be increased in order to improve safety. This research may include sharing of safety data through EASA and/or the NSAs, or propose complementary channels.
Expected Impact:
Depending on the selected use case, research activities could contribute to improving ATM performance in different Key Performance Areas like safety, cost-efficiency, capacity or others.

Air traffic management has an important role to play in reducing the environmental impact of aviation, in addition to the improvements to be derived from new aircraft and engine technologies. Research is needed to better understand the ways in which ATM can help reduce the impact of aviation on the environment, considering not only fuel burn but other aspects such as CO and NOx and contrails.
Also, over the last few years important improvements in observational (e.g., satellites, LIDARs) and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in the atmospheric sciences have taken place leading to improved meteorological products, however they are not in systematic use by ATM actors. Increasingly weather is becoming a significant causal factor for delay, in the Network Operations Report for 2017 (issued by the Network Manager) it is stated “A great number of en-route weather events combined with capacity and staffing issues in some ACCs accounted for much of the delay in 2017. En-route weather delay increased by 30% compared to 2016 and was the double of 2015 weather delay. Airport ATFM delay decreased by 3.6% in 2017. Airport capacity and weather contributed to 83.9% of the total airport delays”. Global and/or long-term phenomena such as climate change, the frequency and severity of extreme weather may even further increase this effect in the future.
Scope:
Proposals may investigate innovative operational changes to ATM aiming at reducing the environmental impact from aviation. These activates should considered different aspects of environmental impact, e.g. climate impact through CO2 and other emissions, local air quality and noise and the effect this will have in the context of global and/or long-term phenomena such as climate change, global warming, and changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather or ash-cloud formation on ATM operations.
Also proposals may research to secure the proper integration of existing and possible new meteorological products into ATM for example to reduce the vulnerability of the ATM system to local weather phenomena and to improve the prediction of 4D Trajectories and network forward planning to enable a minimisation of consequential weather-related delays.
Research activities may focus on the development of a concept for using very high-resolution, very short-range forecasts using numerical weather prediction models and observational data assimilation, and assess the need of new MET data/products. The incorporation of ensemble weather information into decision-support tools, adapted for different ATM stakeholders may also to be investigated.
With respect to the local (airport) operations, the accurate prediction of weather conditions (e.g. visibility, glide-path wind) influencing airport arrival and departure operations along with a consolidated climate risk assessment methodology may be investigated.
This topic is linked to ACARE Challenge 3.
Expected Impact:
The environmental research should enhance the understanding of how the environmental impacts of ATM operations can be reduced during different phases of flight.
The Meteorological research should contribute to enhance ATM efficiency by integrating meteorological information and by leading to a better understanding of the resilience of the ATM system to local weather and global and/or long-term phenomena to better manage consequential delays in the Network."

Safety is inherent to ATM, so safety of operations has always been the highest priority and consequently ATM has reached a very high level of safety. However, research is necessary to maintain or increase this level in the future while capacity and cost-efficiency are also being increased. Additionally, upcoming challenges like increased digitalisation and the foreseen increase of automation can change the way organizations deliver services and thus could impact upon safety and resilience. A better understanding of this influence/impact is necessary to support the design of a safe and resilient future ATM system.
Scope:
As safety is the result of the complex interaction between processes, technology and people working together, the introduction of automation can have more implications on safety than just technical reliability. Proposals can research how increasing the level of automation in ATM could affect the delivered safety levels and develop guidelines for organizations and their respective interactions as well as research and development activities on future automation. These research activities should take into account the state of art on the research on High Performance and High Reliability Organisations and related disciplines.
Proposals may also aim at identifying future research needs related to safety by analysing performance or safety recordings, in which case proposals must demonstrate that they have access to this data. In particular, research activities may aim to identify safety challenges through a large scale analysis of accident and incident data. These activities should evaluate how well identified safety challenges are expected to be addressed by existing SESAR solutions or candidate solutions and, if necessary, may propose at the end of the project new potential SESAR solutions to address the identified and not yet covered safety challenges.
Proposals may also address the increasing need to consider resilience during system design and take into account the three complementary resilience capacities: absorptive capacity, restorative capacity and adaptive capacity. Projects working in this area should analyse the resilience of today’s ATM system and assess how envisioned changes might impact its resilience in the future. In today’s system, humans are a key element for system resilience through team-work, coordination and learning. The expected increase of automation is likely to impact the role that humans are able to play in supporting resilience, thereby requiring an evolution. As there is a huge potential to learn from other sectors (e.g. public safety, banking), projects are encouraged to investigate how resilience, in particular disruption management, is addressed in these domains and to identify approaches and asses their potential for transferring them to ATM to address current or future needs. Projects may consider multiple possibilities and compare and benchmark them against each other and todays ATM systems and procedures. Modelling and simulation might be used for assessing the resilience of selected approaches.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to contribute to increase the body of knowledge of Safety and Resilience of the ATM system by identifying areas of improvement, providing design guidelines and identifying future research needs and in doing so supporting decision making regarding the research and the future design of the ATM system."

Due to growing demand, new regulations, the emergence of new market entrants and innovation in business models there is an increasing market pressure and a need for increasing operational resilience and agility with continued pressure on Europe-wide cost efficiency for aviation and air traffic management. New technology advancements could provide the necessary improvements but the process from innovation to deployment in ATM is currently slow. Research is need to better understand the economic barriers and to identify mechanisms (including, but not limited to, regulations) to accelerate the Research and Innovation (R&I) lifecycle.
Scope:
The range of research that could be covered in this topic is broad and topics mentioned here are only indicative. Research proposals may target and challenge existing SES economic, regulatory and legal frameworks within the timeframes set-out in the Flightpath 2050 vision document.
Research activities should study potential measures to speed up/shorten the R&I lifecycle. This includes changes driven by regulation or derived from natural or forced economic incentives. As introducing new ATM operational improvements often requires the deployment of enabling ground and airborne technology, the adoption of novel technologies in ATM is also determined by the pace of ground system and avionic updates cycle. In particular, proposals may investigate how to accelerate the avionics update cycle. Research activities should study the state of the art practices in ground system and avionics update cycle, explore potential benefits of moving to shorter cycles and identify and evaluate mechanisms to speed-up the spread and adoption of novel technologies or accelerate and lighten any certification and/or approval processes. Proposals may, for example, investigate the feasibility and the potential impact of introducing best equipped or best performing – best served rules through case studies and extract lessons learned.
Proposals may also explore ideas and measures to shorten the R&I lifecycle by focusing on the gap between R&D and deployment. For example, projects may analyse case studies of previous successful or unsuccessful deployment experiences in order to extract lessons learned and develop innovative ways for aligning technology investment and business needs that could help reducing the time between these two phases. Projects may also analyse the challenges associated to the deployment of a specific SESAR solution, be it an already mature solution or one that is still in the research phase.
Proposals may investigate the feasibility of setting up a framework for assessing the impact that regulations will have in practice (e.g. via pilot projects or regulation restricted to a limited area). Although models and simulations are available to assess the effect of policy decisions and regulations in advance, the validity of these approaches remain limited and policy decision still have to be made under high levels of uncertainty regarding their effects. A regulatory testbed should allow to test policy decisions while limiting their potential negative impact. Projects investigating this possibility may analyse the state-of-the-art and best practices in other domains and assess their applicability to the ATM domain.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to contribute to a better understanding of change and barriers of change in ATM and to provide recommendations on how to facilitate change in ATM. This should contribute to accelerating development and deployment of new technologies better fitting stakeholder needs and consequently accelerating the achievement of the ATM Master Plan performance ambition enabled by SESAR solutions."

The application of economic models supports well targeted policy making. However, current economic models applied in ATM are often normative, thus making a number of assumptions about agent rationality that have been demonstrated not to work in practice in several cases. This is because real decision are often not fully rational. An assessment of novel ATM concepts using behavioural economics in ATM at an early design stage could help to predict the actual behaviour of ATM stakeholders and inform decisions about the specific design of the concepts and policy decision making related to their introduction.
Scope:
Proposals and their research activities may investigate the application of behavioural economics to improve economic models in ATM by integrating an improved prediction of actual stakeholder behaviour. These activities should provide insights into how to incentivise desirable behavioural change and enable better decisions though incentives, policies, etc. Proposals should suggest a specific application and justify their selection by explaining the expected benefits of applying behavioural economics for this application.
For example, proposals may investigate suggested business changes that are expected to bring significant benefits to the ATM network and analyse how their introduction may impact the behaviour of stakeholders. The research activities are expected to provide new insights on the expected benefits and recommendations for investigated business changes. In particular proposals may, for example:
Investigate the introduction of new types of legal contracts and changes to regulations required by the concept of the trajectory broker which foresees an evolution of the Network Manager offering trajectory products to Airspace Users and ordering capacity from Air Navigation Service Providers. These projects should cover the relationship between Network Manager and Air Navigation Service Providers and between Network Manager and Airspace Users;
Aim at improving demand forecast models at network or local level by predicting passenger behaviour more accurately, for example by analysing how the modal choice is impacted by airport access time or environmental considerations;
Study existing capacity provision strategies of ANSPs and their impact on airline route choices in order to develop improved demand prediction models or capacity provision strategies. Furthermore, projects could aim at providing a better understanding of perceived fairness and equity of potential upcoming regulations making it possible to plan how to better implement new policies;
Perform a comparative study of existing controller rostering policies, including shift entry and exit times and sector rostering during a particular shift of different ANSPs, analyse their correlation to the capacity offered by the ANSP and provide recommendations for changes. Research activities must consider human performance aspects of controller rostering, as well as the psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social aspects.
These examples are indicative and proposal may suggest to apply behavioural economics to other decision processes if this can be duly justified.
Expected Impact:
The research will make it possible to provide a better prediction of stakeholder behaviour and contribute to inform policy making so that behaviour that improves the overall system performance be realised."

Proposals may in particular focus on systems based on machine learning techniques. Proposals should follow a holistic approach and consider legal and regulatory aspects including privacy as well as the technical aspects (architecture, system performance, reliability, etc.) of the approval/certification jointly to ensure that the different disciplines are aligned. On the one hand, the research activities could investigate and evaluate approaches that can potentially be applied for the approval and/or certification of automation and that allow to demonstrate the safety of automation during normal, impaired operation and recovery phases of continuous and safe service provision. On the other hand, these research activities could aim at providing guidelines for developing advanced automation in order to simplify approval/certification.

Please note that EASA is developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Roadmap planned to be released by mid-2019 which aims at identifying the opportunities, challenges and impact of this emerging technology and to propose a corresponding action plan. Proposals should plan effort to analyse how their research is positioned with respect to the EASA roadmap.
Expected Impact:
The expected outcome is twofold: Projects are expected to provide guidelines for the designing of advanced automation in line with approval and/or certification requirements and to provide new methods for the approval and/or certification of advanced automation. Both should contribute to enabling high levels of automation in ATM while a keeping safety on a high level."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Keeping aircraft separated from each other is one of the core functions of ATM. In the SESAR concept, ground automation supports air traffic controllers in their task of providing separation management. Separation management starts by strategically limiting the density of potential separation conflicts (i.e. limiting traffic density and traffic complexity), but is ultimately ensured tactically by keeping aircraft separated at or above the pre-defined separation minima. The RECAT and Time Based Separation (TBS) activities in SESAR have made it possible to update the separation minima between successive aircraft on final approach, thereby increasing runway throughput and safety. Further refinement of separation minima between aircraft on final approach (Pair Wise Separation RECAT-2) and between departures is ongoing in SESAR 2020 Wave 1 solution PJ.02.01, with important results expected to become publicly available at the end of 2019. However, in en-route and TMA, the tactical separation minima are essentially the same as they were decades ago.
Previous research SESAR exploratory research (R-WAKE project) has developed an initial concept for updating the wake separation minima scheme applicable in en-route and TMA (except where RECAT applies), and a new operational improvement is in the process of being added to the European ATM Master Plan. The objective of this topic is to build on R-WAKE’s work to progress on the definition and initial validation of this concept.
Scope:
It is anticipated that this work will support the development of a future SESAR solutions that will make it possible to move away from 'pre-determined' one-size-fits-all minima that are in use in current operations towards a more dynamic view of separation minima, whereby ATC separates aircraft to an assured minimum risk (dynamically determined for each pair of aircraft depending on the aircraft types, the geometry of the encounter and the atmospheric conditions) rather than a defined distance standard'.
The new separation scheme may include the consideration of reduced vertical separation minima, potentially including the possibility of using a minimum vertical separation of 500 ft. from the ground to unlimited, which may allow the use of intermediate flight levels, e.g. 275, 285, 295, 305…. This reduced vertical separation scheme is referred to as RVSM 2.0, and would dramatically increase airspace capacity both in en-route and the TMA. The new separation scheme may also consider the use of combined separation minima (i.e. XXX feet vertical and YY NM horizontal) in order to increase flexibility and make maximum use of airspace capacity.
In the current environment, the 1.000 ft. or 5NM separation minima prevent most wake encounters, but wake encounters are still possible between aircraft that are separated above the prescribed minima. The new separation scheme may also increase the separation minima above what is applied today (e.g. to 1.500 ft. instead of 1.000 ft.) in certain cases in order to reduce the instances of wake encounters between aircraft that are correctly separated above the minima, thereby increasing safety.
It is anticipated that the development and implementation of new separation minima for en-route will follow a similar step-wise approach to RECAT, in which at first the new minima would be dependent on static aircraft characteristics, and in the future it may be possible to define dynamic minima dependent on dynamic aircraft characteristics (weight, atmospheric conditions, etc.). It is expected that the new static minima would be dependent on the geometry of the encounter and the wind and other atmospheric characteristics (e.g. height of the tropopause).
This concept presents key human performance challenges and for this reason the human performance aspects related to the applicability of a new separation scheme will need to be considered. Like for RECAT-2, it is expected that ATCOs will need support tools in order to be able to apply a more complex separation scheme. It is expected that RECAT EU and RECAT-2 experience and lessons learned in human performance and development of Optimised Runway Delivery (ORD) tools will be useful.
Proposals shall consider altimetry requirements, potentially considering the use of GNSS based geometric altimetry in combination with barometric altimetry to support the reduction of vertical separation minima.
Although the key objective is the redefinition of the wake minima, there is also the need to start researching the potential for reduction of MRS, because where the newly defined minimum wake separation (MWS) is lower than the applicable minimum radar separation (MRS), the new reduced wake minima will only be applicable if MRS can be safely reduced. For this reason, the reduction of the radar separation minima scheme is also in the scope of this topic. This may need to consider minimum surveillance performance requirements, and vertical navigation performance requirements. The new MRS may also be geometry dependent (e.g. reduced separation when in-trail) or include combined separations (e.g. 500 ft. and 1 NM).
The consideration of separation minima between IFR RPAS or between IFR RPAS and manned aircraft is out of scope for this topic.
It is anticipated that the development and implementation of a new separation scheme will be a lengthy process. The solution may develop an interim concept to predict encounters where two aircraft that are separated above the current minima will cross with a geometry where preliminary research results indicate that there is an increased risk of a wake encounter. The research of such an interim concept may need to evaluate the emerging legal/liability aspects.
It is anticipated that the research may require live data collection, big data analysis and use of machine learning.
Expected Impact:
The new separation scheme for en-route is expected to bring large benefits in terms of airspace capacity, in many cases literally allowing capacity to be doubled thanks to Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) 2.0, which will make it possible to use of the intermediate flight levels (…,275, 285, 295, 305,…). Safety will also be increased, by reducing the instances of en-route wake encounters by prescribing new separation minima under certain atmospheric conditions and/or between certain specific aircraft pairs."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This topic explores the evolution of controller/pilot voice and datalink communication concept beyond what is currently covered by the industrial research programme.
In the area of voice communications, the current controller-pilot voice communications concept of operations is a de facto result of the way of working and of the performance of the legacy system (i.e. mainly the analogue DSB-AM VHF radio system). In the area of datalink, the current CPDLC is applicable only above FL285.
The research challenge is to develop the high-level global A/G communication concept of operations addressing how voice and data will be combined in the future to support the future ATM concept, what will be the role of voice exchanges and how they will be managed, and the concept of operations for the extension of datalink below its current scope.
Scope:
The output of this project must be the future global[1] A/G communication concept of operations (CONOPS). The future controller-pilot global A/G communications CONOPS shall cover both the future voice and the extension of datalink communications below FL 285. This CONOPS will be used as an input to the SESAR concept of operations, and also as an input for the future industrial research projects working in these areas.
It is anticipated that the development of the voice and datalink concept of operations will require the involvement of technical experts external to the consortium (e.g. through technical workshops), with the consortium’s main role being that of providing the background information, the operational view and framework, and facilitating the workshops and consolidating the results to produce concept or concepts of operations as the final technical deliverable of the project.
It is expected that the following SESAR Wave 2 industrial research solutions will contribute experts to the CONOPS:
Solution 8, “Dynamic E-TMA for Advanced Continuous Climb and Descent Operations and improved Arrival and Departure Operations”;
Solution 21, “Digital evolution of integrated surface management”;
Solution 56, “Improved vertical profiles through enhanced vertical clearances”;
Solution 57, “RBT revision supported by datalink and increased automation”.
Solution 73, “Flight-centric ATC and Improved Distribution of Separation Responsibility in ATC”; and
Solution 77, “FCI Services”.
The integration of the technical and operational point of view is essential for the success of this project. The consortium must therefore have both operational and technical expertise, and the proposal must demonstrate how the work plan will ensure the continuous coordination between operational and technical experts.
Proposals are expected to first define the global A/G communication concept of operations considering voice and datalink working in combination in the long term (i.e. beyond 2030+), addressing all phases of flight. The research activities will assess how exchanges between pilots and controllers will be performed including which types of exchanges will use voice medium and which types of exchanges will use Data Link medium (i.e. CPDLC services and its future evolutions of CPDLC or equivalent services), in which circumstances each medium will be used and how datalink and voice will be combined in different environments.
Once the global A/G communication concept will be clarified, the project is expected to define in more details the A/G voice (sub-) concept of operations and will provide insight into the following operational questions:
How the future A/G voice communications will be managed (e.g. will they still operate under a broadcast principle? Is the party-line effect still required (like as provided by the current VHF system)? Or future A/G voice communication will be under a point-to-point principle and in which case how a communication will be established? Would A/G communications be a mix of broadcast and point-to-point? Would pilot to pilot voice communication be a requirement?
What will be the performance requirements (e.g. latency, continuity)?
How current and future voice “technologies” will be mixed during transition periods so that it is transparent to pilots and controllers (e.g. within the same areas when transitioning from legacy to new; between two areas (equipped and not yet equipped); supporting a mix of aircraft equipage)?
Which level of security will be required (e.g. encryption, authentication)?
What are the wide-area communications needs (e.g. should voice communication sessions be maintained during a flight between a pilot and the “in-charge” controller in case the flight centric concept would be applied)?
Which are the future automation needs connected to voice communications (e.g. speech recognition, handover, priority call…) and which operational requirements they would support?
Proposals will also address the extension of datalink (including below FL285 and considering the global A/G communication concept of operations as addressed at project start) and how it will make possible to maximise the benefits of many of the concepts currently being researched in the industrial research programme, e.g. dynamic uplink of custom or standard instrument departures (SID) during taxi, dynamic uplink of custom or standard arrival routes when the aircraft has already initiated descent, uplink of enhanced vertical clearances with one or multiple vertical constraints along the way for aircraft flying at any level. However, important challenges have been identified in this area, e.g. increased head-down time for pilots, need for lower latency in the more dynamic lower airspace and airport environment, etc.
The CONOPS for the extension of datalink should provide insight into the following operational questions:
How can the increased flight-crew head-down time be mitigated (e.g. autoload clearances only, HMI improvements, voice-recognition, reduced number of technical/system messages…)?
What would be the acceptable performances (e.g. latency) in the different environments?
Which level of automation should be further introduced? E.g. should in some environments hand-over between different ATSUs become seamless from the flight crew point of view (e.g. connected to ATC, with hand-over being transparent to ATC – no new log-on required when going from one ATSU to another)? Should coupling between Data Link and voice be introduced (e.g. change of voice “channel” be induced through datalink commands)?
Proposals must demonstrate awareness of the future A/G communication infrastructure (which is supported by LDACS, Satcom and AeroMACS operating under a multilink approach) and which will support the future A/G voice and Data Link communications. The selected team will work with A/G communication IR solutions (e.g. Solution 77 which will be the interface with other technical solutions e.g. LDACS) to consider the technical feasibility and technical impact that the choice of the concept of operation choices and each of the operational requirements would have on the future A/G communication architecture. The common operational and technical assessment will consider reducing requirements on aircraft configuration (e.g. reducing the number of or completely removing legacy avionics when installing avionics supporting new concepts).
Bids must demonstrate access to operational data related to the current datalink implementation in higher airspace in Europe and/or the US. A task should be planned earlier in the project to produce a report with the lessons learned from the implementation in the higher airspace and an analysis of what they may need to take into account in the datalink extension. Please note that the analysis of lessons learned should be restricted to the operational aspects (technical lessons-learned are explicitly out of the scope of this topic).
Proposals must also demonstrate awareness of the previous SESAR research in the area of extension of datalink. In particular, the output of the ATC Full datalink (AFD) demonstration project must be considered.
For the voice concept of operations, all operational environments where ATC is provided must be considered, including: en-route in high and low density (including both day and night shifts with band-boxed sectors), oceanic, polar, tower, TMA and approach. Both traditional ATC service based on geographical sectors and flight-centric (sector-less) ATC must be considered.
For the datalink extension concept of operations, all the operational environments of interest must be considered. The operational environments of interest are en-route airspace below flight level 285, TMA and approach and airport surface for operations at the apron after push-back and on the manoeuvring area. Use of datalink for clearance delivery while the aircraft is still at the gate (before push-back) shall also be considered.
Proposals must plan effort to bring the output of their research to ICAO as part of the dissemination of their work.
Expected Impact:
The move towards new ways to support voice exchanges and the extension of the use of datalink beyond what is possible today are part of the digital aviation vision. They will enable the sustainable growth that is necessary to meet the capacity challenge that is described in the ATM Master Plan.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) is one of the fundamental enablers of the ATM as it supports locating and identifying air vehicles, and exchanging information with and between air vehicles. The research and development for the evolution of the legacy Integrated communications, navigation and surveillance systems to a new integrated approach (iCNS) is already under way in the SESAR IR programme. The iCNS will bring ATM to the next level, with a resilient architectural design that combines satellite and ground-based services. The exploratory research challenge is to develop applications that complement or further develop the work under way in IR, with a particular focus on making it possible for a wider AU community (including GA, drones and the military) to access the most advanced iCNS services. There is also a need to plan how to ensure that the future increased demand for connectivity can be fulfilled.
Scope:
The full range of research that could be covered in this topic is broad; the application areas mentioned here are merely indicative. Projects may target implementation in the mid-term or could address timeframes up to those of the Flightpath 2050 vision document.
Please note that this is an application-oriented research topic. Proposals for this topic must describe a concrete new CNS enabler for ATM or a new CNS use for ATM of an existing enabler and describe how they will undertake its initial validation, with the ultimate goal of either proposing its inclusion in the ATM Master Plan for further development or discarding it.
The SJU has identified the following application areas of interest:
Application area 1: Low cost alternative Position, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) for General Aviation and drones
The research aims at defining, developing and validating a concept of alternative positioning, navigation and timing (A-PNT) for small aircraft (GA, Ultra-Light (UL) Aircraft, Very Light Aircraft (VLA), Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)) to meet the requirements in PBN/RNP operations in case of a GNSS degradation or outage. This standard and low-cost A-PNT concept and system would allow the integration of these airspace users in an efficient and non-discriminatory manner while ensuring safety and security levels and the desired performance gains in terms of resilience and cost efficiency.
The research may address, for example:
The assessment of innovative technologies such as inertial systems, low cost atomic gyroscopes and accelerometers and radio altimeters that allow consolidating the on-board computed position as well.
The development of Innovative new vision based navigation system for these AUs consisting of image processing algorithms and their potential combination with GNSS to increase access.
The potential civil-military interoperability and synergies. The potential use of low-cost on-board solutions that meet PBN requirements, on the basis of the reutilisation or adaptation of currently available capabilities, is of utmost importance for State aircraft operations;
The specific requirements for auto land for smaller independent on ILS system, based on GPS, inertial positioning and other sensors to increase the vertical accuracy e.g. radar tracker, LIDAR, radio altimeters or vision based navigation. This shall take into consideration work under WG-105.
This research in this application area may build on previous SESAR ER project NAVISAS or propose alternative approaches. Proposals for work in this area must explain how their work is positioned.
Application area 2: Improving security and resilience against GNSS threats
For the medium and long term, it is expected that Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) will become the primary means of aircraft navigation. However, satellite navigation receivers are vulnerable to intentional or not-intentional threats/interferences (especially to jamming and spoofing) which may cause the total loss of navigation with the subsequent implications for the navigation services based on GNSS (or its augmented derivatives).
The research shall:
Propose solutions to improve security and enhance resilience against these threats;
Develop a new concept for the GNSS interference air navigation threat's management, based on implementing detection and localization of jamming and spoofing on-board the aircrafts.
Assess and validate the proposed algorithms to detect and localize the interference.
The research shall take into consideration the work and results GATEMAN is expected to provide up to the end of 2019.
Application area 3: Improving cybersecurity on CNS services
In anticipation of future more secured performance based CNS, there is a need to make CNS services more secure and resilient against cyber-threats. The research may propose effective and automated solutions for intrusion detection and identify security controls and associated security requirements. The research shall also propose potential mitigation measures in case CNS services are breached.
The solution shall consider (if applicable) the work performed by SESAR solutions on cyber-security as an input to the study and consolidate their analysis on existing and future vulnerabilities.
The scope of the work may be limited to a few selected services e.g. PBN services, surveillance service, etc. and shall complement the top-down vision as defined in Industrial Research activities e.g. PJ.14-01-01 and PJ.14-W2-76.
Application area 4: Manned and un-manned aircraft protection from non-cooperative targets
The increasing number of drones is causing safety and security concerns within the aviation industry. A number of collisions between aircraft and drones have been already reported worldwide, and this number will likely increase in the coming future if nothing changes. This research area covers the development of non-cooperative detection. Proposals for work in this area must demonstrate knowledge of the state-of-the-art in sensors for non-cooperative detection, propose an innovative detection application, and describe how they will undertake its initial validation. The proposals must explain the high level performance requirements they will validate their innovative against and how they relate to an operational need. The work plan must include the derivation of lower level operational requirements and the initial validation of the application. The validation of the avoid manoeuvres is out of the scope for this CNS topic.
Please note that SESAR has previous ER work in this area by project PercEvite, which is ongoing. Proposals for work in this area should review PercEvite’s publicly available material and explain how their proposal is positioned with respect to PercEvite. The proposed work should either build on PercEvite’s work or be complementary to it, but should avoid the repetition of PercEvite’s work. Proposals for work taking a completely different approach from PercEvite are welcome.
Application area 5: Use of 5G for ATM purposes
5G technology is one of the areas that have been more rapidly evolving; it may represent a game changer for connectivity if applied to ATM. Ground-based 5G can release the full potential of satellite based communications, while satcom has also useful properties for 5G in terms of security, resilience, coverage and delivery of broadband. Proposals for work in this application area must propose a satellite and/or ground based 5G application for ATM.
The research in this application area must take into consideration the work done by PJ.14-02-05 on LTE/4G/5G for General Aviation in industrial research and project DroC2om that is working on 4G/5G (and Satcom) in the framework of UAVs. Results from both PJ.14-02-05 and DroC2com are expected at the end of 2019. Projects working in this application area are expected to plan effort to analyse their results and consider how they relate to their work.
Please note that the above list of application areas is not intended as prescriptive. Proposals for work in alternative application areas are welcome, provided adequate justification and background are included in the proposal.
All proposals for work in this topic must consider the top-down iCNS view that is being defined in SESAR’s Wave 1 Industrial Research activities e.g. PJ.14-01-01, whose final publicly available deliverables are expected at the end of 2019, and PJ.14-W2-76. Projects should reserve effort to analyse the output of these IR projects and incorporate them in their research.
Expected Impact:
Successful research in this topic will have the potential to generate high positive benefits for ATM in terms of resource efficient and fit-for-purpose CNS capabilities as well as improvements in security, improved predictability of data link performance, reduced level of air-ground communication issues and improved efficiency of ATM services delivery."

The objective of SESAR is to improve the performance of the ATM system. This topic is aimed at the development applications that improve the assessment and management of the performance of ATM in operations beyond what is already covered by the IR programme. The improvement of the assessment of the performance of ATM concepts during the full R&D cycle is also in scope.
The exploratory research challenge is to propose an improvement to the assessment or to the management of performance in ATM and undertake its initial validation. All proposals must consider how their proposed improvement relates to both the current SESAR Performance Framework and the SES performance scheme.
Scope:
Proposals submitted for this topic should clearly describe an ATM performance assessment or an ATM performance management concept and describe what the expected benefits would be and how they will undertake its initial validation. Proposal should take previous work into account, in particular.
The following non-exhaustive list of potential candidate application areas has been identified as being of interest by the SESAR Joint Undertaking:
Application area 1: Development of digitalization indicators for ATM
SESAR contributes to the EC’s digitalization objectives by bringing digitalization to ATM, in accordance with the Aviation Strategy for Europe. The challenge is to propose and validate digitalization indicators that are relevant for ATM and can be used to assess progress. The research must consider how the proposed ATM digitalization indicators compare to those used by other industries, as well as to the more cross-industry generic indicators and to the ATM digitalization indicators that will be proposed in the next ATM Master Plan (publication expected during 2019).
Application area 2: Improved consideration of resilience by the SES/SESAR performance framework.
Resilience can be defined “as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and re-organize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity and feedback”. The consideration of resilience is part of the SESAR safety reference material, but the consideration of resilience beyond safety in SESAR is limited to the measuring of resilience to capacity (as percentage of capacity loss in non-nominal situations), which is used by projects working on concepts that support disruption management. Delay, fuel efficiency, punctuality and predictability indicators are the same for nominal and non-nominal situations, and SESAR ambitions and validation targets are set based on average values measured in real operations, where outliers may have a disproportionate impact. Likewise, the SES performance scheme sets targets against average values, without differentiating between nominal and non-nominal situations. Research should propose a way forward to improve the consideration of resilience by suggesting different indicators and/or targets for nominal and non-nominal situations, and undertake an initial validation (e.g. show how the assessment of performance would be more meaningful with their proposed methodology). The indicators should be able to capture the three the three complementary resilience capacities: absorptive capacity, restorative capacity and adaptive capacity. Proposals for work in this area must describe how their work is positioned with respect to the research project RESILIENCE 2050.
Application area 3: Development of multi-modal performance indicators and ambition
The Flightpath2050 has set a goal for a maximum of four hours of door-to-door travel time in Europe by the year 2050. There is a need to better understand how to work towards the achievement of this ambition, by breaking down the total travel time indicator between different modes of transport and different phases of travel within each transport mode (e.g. for air travel total travel time could be broken down into check-in time, baggage collection time, in-airport walking time, travel time to and from the airport...), and then benchmark each of the phases and set ambitions for each of them. Proposals must focus on measurements that affect air transport, but may include the consideration of other modes of transport if their relevance to ATM is justified in the proposal (e.g. travel to and from the airport, travel times in other modes of transport for comparison with flight-times and potential consideration by ATFM or for the route charging scheme). The consideration of the trade-offs in performance between passenger travel time and transport mode travel time is also in scope for this topic, e.g. to consider when an aircraft waits for delayed connection passengers (arriving by air or by another transport mode) the trade-off between the increased delay of the flight and the decreased delay of the passengers (compared to whether the flight had not waited for them and they had had a longer wait until the next flight).
Proposals in this area must plan effort for coordinating with projects awarded under topic - Innovation in Airport Operations” - working on the improvement of airport operations in contribution to multimodality and projects awarded under topic - “ATM Role in Intermodal Transport”.
Application area 4: Development of environmental indicators
The objective is to further develop the assessment of the impact on the environment of aviation, measuring noise, air quality and pollution beyond what is currently considered by the SES regulation and the SESAR performance framework. Indicators may assess, for example, noise impact from traditional aviation and/or drones, NOX, contrails and their impact, local air quality, etc. Projects working in this area should consider how their proposed approach compares to the approach by Clean Sky and refer to the European Aviation Environmental Report.
The research activities may also review the interrelation of the environmental targets set by the SES Performance Scheme for the second reference period (RP2), the PRB Advice to the Commission in the setting of Union-wide performance targets for RP3, the environmental ambition in the ATM Master Plan for 2035, the SESAR Programme validation targets and the environmental ambitions set by Flightpath2050 ACARE for 2050 in order to provide insight on how they complement each other and how the metrics used in SESAR may evolve to best support the achievement of all the aforementioned ambitions and targets.
Application area 5: Further development of the concept of unconstrained reference trajectory against which to calculate additional track-miles or flight-time in the TMA
For the calculation of additional arrival flight-time in the TMA, the current SES regulation uses as a reference the unimpeded trajectory from a distance of 40NM around the airport, which is calculated as the statistical minimum for each aircraft category. For en-route, the reference trajectory is the great circle distance.
The objective of the research is to study potential evolutions of the current SES indicator in order to overcome some of the current limitations, for example:
Limitations due to the reference a trajectory in the TMA being calculated statistically, which may result in situations where an average improvement in track miles counts as a decrease in performance and vice versa.
Limitations due to the great circle not considering the ARES demand that affects the trajectory, which may result in an increase in ARES demand resulting in a decrease of the performance of the ANSP.
Limitations due to the additional time in the TMA not considering departures.
Limitations of the one-size-fits-all 40NM limit between en-route and TMA used in the SES not being tailored for each airports.
Application area 6: Development of arrival delay indicators and targets
From the point of view of the passenger, “on-time” arrival is a key performance ambition, Arrival predictability is also considered key for the efficient management of airport resources. However, neither the SES performance scheme nor the ATM Masterplan, SESAR performance framework or the SESAR Validation Targets include arrival delay metrics, ambitions or targets. Measuring arrival delay is challenging, because of the difficulty of finding a valid reference (e.g. airline schedules often include buffers). Moreover, limiting the number of flights arriving outside a certain interval is more relevant than measurements of mean or variability, but the interval of interest may be different depending on the stakeholder (e.g. from the passenger perspective, arriving a few minutes early is not a problem, but early arrivals may disrupt airport operations). Improvements to the predictability of the in-block time may not only come from aircraft flying closer to their planned trajectory, but also from improvements in the planning that make it more realistic (e.g. planning that considers the SID or the STAR, planning that considers the statistical flight-time with usual DCTs…). Project working in this area must consider all stakeholders, and also consider how their proposed approach compares to the FAA’s fifteen-minute delay criterion (where aircraft arriving earlier than fifteen minutes after their scheduled time are considered to be on time). In order to cater for different stakeholder needs and priorities, multiple indicators and targets may be proposed and validated.
Application area 7: Further development of civil-military cooperation and coordination indicators
Civil military cooperation and cooperation indicators in the SESAR performance framework allow a limited assessment of the improvement of civil-military coordination concepts in terms of increased civil and military flight efficiency, as well as of the effectiveness of the coordination processes (by measuring the volume of reserved airspace that is not used) and the effectiveness of the process from the military mission perspective (for optimizing the ARES volume). There is a need to further develop these indicators, as well as to research into the interaction between the impact of the demand of reserved areas on the achievable flight efficiency. In addition, there is a need to understand the apportionment of SESAR ambition to increase flight efficiency between projects working on the improvement of civil-military coordination processes and projects working in other areas.
Application area 8: Development of flexibility metrics, ambitions and targets
The flexibility KPA has indicators aims at measuring the flexibility of the ATM system, e.g. measuring the delay for late-filing flights or flights which request a change over their original plan, or allocation of airspace reservation at short notice. There is a need to further develop flexibility metrics and targets. Research in this area should identify demands for flexibility among stakeholders, propose and validate relevant metrics and perform a preliminary benchmarking.
This list of potential application areas is not prescriptive; proposals addressing application areas beyond those listed above are welcome, provided adequate background and justification are provided in the proposal.
Expected Impact:
Improvements in the area of performance assessment, benchmarking and ambition/target setting and trade-off between indicators will enable an improved management of the performance of the ATM system in operations, and a better assessment of performance in R&D."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Although the European Operational Concept Validation Methodology (E-OCVM) has been successfully applied in industrial research activities in SESAR, there is a need to explore potential improvements to the methodology in order to ensure a more flexible and adaptable approach that could facilitate a rapid development and progress towards the future ATM. The vision for this future ATM considers significantly higher levels of connectivity and automation than today and this may need adaptations in the current human performance methodologies to be able to address these challenges.
Scope:
The scope of this topic covers the following aspects:
Application area 1: Macro-modelling applied to Air Traffic Management
A macro-model is a theoretical or conceptual model that is able to reproduce the behaviour/trends of the whole system, rather than that of its individual elements, and that aims at addressing large-scale, global and/or systemic factors.
Research activities shall develop potential solutions that are able to use in practice the knowledge on emergent behaviour detection and overcome the limitations in this area of the current E-OCVM. In particular, the research may address the following areas:
Investigate new methodologies and techniques/tools for macro modelling and assess their feasibility and applicability to ATM identifying main advantages and limitations.
Develop a macro-model of the ATM system (using techniques/tools identified above) and demonstrate:
The model capability to assess the potential performance impact of future concepts/solutions (still under validation in Industrial Research, under Exploratory Research, or new ones) at ECAC level The proposal shall describe the reference scenario (ATM system without implemented solutions) and the solution scenario(s) (ATM system with implemented solution(s)) that are intended to be used as test cases to validate the model and demonstrate its capabilities.;
The model capability to address trade-offs between alternative concepts/solutions, between KPAs and stakeholders;
The model capability to support the decision making process.
The capability to address emergent behaviour analysis, in order to allow analysis of impact of new concepts on all stakeholders at the same time, and macro-safety cases based on the emergent behaviours that are detected with the new methodology.
Relevant simplifications and assumptions made for building the macro model should be documented and be delivered with the modal.
Assess the potential use of models (e.g. agent-based models) in order to consider how uncertainty can impact the output of R&D activities: Run model-based simulations to quantify potential rare event instances (in particular for non-nominal situations) and consider how this can be used in the development cycle in order to identify where uncertainty must be reduced to obtain the target safety level;
Align to key reference material from SESAR programme i.e. SESAR Performance Framework and SESAR Solutions catalogue (e.g. if the solution is already under development in ER or IR, the proposal shall be aligned to the latest applicable solution description or document any deviation with respect to that baseline). The research may deviate from these references but any deviation shall be documented and its impact on the results evaluated;
The proposal shall build on the results and work under exploratory projects such as Domino, evoATM, and VISTA, etc. where relevant.
The technical proposal shall facilitate an iterative and incremental approach towards the objectives, to allow (if required) re-orientation or adaptation of scope, objectives, etc.
Application area 2: Evolution of European Operational Concept Validation Methodology (EOCVM) for ATM
The research aims at performing a critical review of the European Operational Concept Validation Methodology (E-OCVM) and propose concrete improvements to the methodology. These improvements should be well detailed in order to facilitate the transfer, integration and training activities.
In particular the research shall:
Consider the applicability to ATM of other validation methodologies (that may be used in other domains) e.g. principles of agile development for reducing the duration of R&D phase in ATM, facilitate the identification of emerging solutions that could quickly progress from low maturity levels (V0/V1, typically under the scope of exploratory research) to higher maturity levels (V2/V3, typically under the scope of industrial research) and then towards deployment;
Critically assess the E-OCVM case based approach, and in particular the safety case, and propose the required improvements so through the application of the methodology it would be possible to identify as soon as possible any safety issue that if un-detected may imply important costs at a later stage e.g. deployment;
Review the roles and responsibilities in the validation methodology e.g. between development and validation roles;
Propose ideas to better integrate technical validation of technological solutions (enablers) and technology readiness levels (TRL) into E-OCVM;
Review the SESAR maturity criteria and propose improvements to the list of criteria and the means of compliance;
Address the analysis of differences between the validated results e.g. performance benefits at the end of the validation cycle (V3/TRL6) and what happens when solutions are finally implemented and in operations, and extract lessons learnt that could help to improve the E-OCVM and the validation process in general;
Explore how pilot implementation projects could be used to collect operational data and detect emergent behaviours that could be used to provide feedback to solutions/concepts at lower level of maturity.
Application area 3: Evolution of Human Performance Assessment methodology
This research area aims at developing and validating concrete improvements to the SESAR Human performance Reference Material that can be input in the next cycle of Industrial research, in particular considering environments with higher degrees of automation. Note that Human performance is not only linked to safety but also related to training needs, cost efficiency and workload and that is why this is kept separated from the previous application area. The improvements could cover, for example:
less invasive techniques for collection of HP data; large-scale data collection of impact of automation on HP;
innovative use of human performance data collection techniques e.g. speech recognition, brain wave measurements, eye-tracking, etc.;
human behaviour modelling, e.g. for Fast Time Simulation Fast Time simulation (FTS).
The research shall address the potential use of more advanced HP assessment tools in future R&D work. The research may consider as well behavioural sciences.
Note that the research shall take into consideration both SES performance scheme and SESAR performance framework, and latest applicable version of the SESAR Human Performance Reference Material (HPRM) as the ”as-is” reference.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the research in this topic will identify concrete improvements to the methodologies applied in industrial research in SESAR in order to: better consider the challenges derived from the future vision for ATM, to optimise the validation process and to allow the rapid put into operations of innovative ideas with high potential performance benefits."

ADS-B-in equipage delivers precise information of the surrounding traffic in the cockpit. Airlines have already starting equipping their fleets with ADS-B-in in order to take advantage of the initial applications that are already operational (ATSAW and Oceanic ITP). A number of additional ADS-B-in applications are currently under research in the Industrial Research Programme. The objective of this topic is to investigate additional applications beyond what is covered in IR to leverage ADS-B-in equipage.
Scope:
The SESAR concept of operations is ground-based, but even in a ground-based concept ad-hoc delegation of separation responsibility from controllers to pilots may bring benefits. Airborne Spacing – Interval Management (ASPA-IM) and CDTI Assisted visual separation (CAVS) are currently under research in the Industrial Research Programme. In addition, the industrial research programme also consider use of ADS-B-in capabilities by airborne safety nets, SURF-A and ACAS X (extended hybrid surveillance). Bids in this topic should propose a new ADS-B-in application and propose a plan to develop a high-level concept of operations and an initial validation (from TRL0 to TRL2) with the objective of assessing whether there would be value in including it in the ATM Master Plan.
The following two innovative applications of interest have been identified by the SJU:
Application area 1: Formation flying
In formation flying operations, an aircraft is positioned in a specific area closely behind another aircraft on the same route, where the wake vortices generated by a leading aircraft push air upwards, so the follower aircraft can benefit from this lift and therefore reduce the engine thrust and, at the same speed, significantly reduce the fuel consumption (initial estimate is that savings for the follower aircraft can be up to 8-12%), with the associated reduction in CO2 emissions. A positive impact in terms of increased airspace capacity (more aircraft in the same portion of airspace) may also be possible. It is envisaged that the concept will allow the creation of strings of aircraft, each benefitting from the wake of the previous aircraft. Fuel savings are realised in the follower aircraft, and the concept has neither a negative nor a positive impact on the operational performance of the aircraft being followed.
The avionics requirements for the follower aircraft are ADS-B-in with a station keeping capability for the follower aircraft to allow it to maintain the prescribed separation with the aircraft ahead. It is expected that the development of the station keeping capabilities will leverage previous SESAR research on airborne spacing, which already enabled a follower aircraft to stay a specified time or distance behind a leader. The leader aircraft does not require any equipage other than ADS-B-out, which is already a requirement by the regulation.
Management of the rendezvous, formation-flying phase and split of military formations is already routine in European skies, but the concept is not directly applicable to civil formations. There is a need to develop a high-level concept of operations of how to manage civilian formation flying. The concept may include some strategic planning (e.g. to allow reduced fuel upload requirements for a flight that is planned to take advantage of formation flying) or be exclusively tactical (i.e. controllers identifying opportunities for formation flying to equipped aircraft that have reported that they are looking for a leader for fuel savings purposes, potentially with the support of the ATC ground system). Like in military formation flying, the concept must include the delegation from controllers to the flight crew of the responsibility for separation between leader and follower.
Application area 2: Use of ACAS logic for separation
In the current SESAR concept of operations, aircraft can manoeuvre based on their picture of the traffic obtained from SSR or ADS-B-in only for collision avoidance when in an ACAS manoeuvre. Previous SESAR ER project AGENT [52] has examined the possibility of aircraft manoeuvring earlier, in the separation provision layer rather than in the collision avoidance layer, with clear criteria being established for allocating separation responsibility to either air or ground agents. Projects working in this application area may build on AGENT’s approach, or take a different approach, e.g. a ground-based concept with ad-hoc ground-to-air delegation of separation responsibility.
Please note that this list of innovative areas is not intended as prescriptive; bids addressing alternative ADS-B-in applications are welcome, provided adequate justification and background are provided in the proposal.
The output of the project must include a high-level concept of operations describing an innovative ADS-B-in application. The objective of the concept of operations is to provide a vision of how the innovative concept will work within the current system and how it will change the operations from the point of view of all stakeholders. By its nature, the final concept of operations deliverable must be public. It is expected that intermediate deliverables supporting the development of the concept of operations (e.g. literature reviews, reports of workshops or interviews) will usually also be marked as public unless there is a specific reason for not doing so. Bidders for this topic marking any deliverables as confidential in their bid are strongly advised to provide adequate justification for the need for confidentiality in the bid.
Expected Impact:
In the era of digital aviation, ADS-B-in applications will enable the involvement of flight-crews in the air traffic control task by taking advantage of the digital vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity. Leveraging ADS-B-in equipage will allow airlines to get best value for money for their investments in avionics."

The future ATM architecture is distributed, and will make extensive use of digital technologies to enable a more efficient organisation of the entire mobility system. The implementation of this model provides opportunities for increased efficiencies through the consolidation of services, and increased resilience by increasing the flexibility in the design of fall-back solutions but will face challenges that need to be addressed e.g. cyber security. Securing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all ATM operations, in particular in the face of rapidly increasing cyber security risks, will be an inherent and collaborative element for civil and military stakeholders in the design, development, deployment, operations and maintenance of ATM capabilities.
Scope:
Proposals must describe a specific application supporting the improvement of the ATM architecture, with a particular focus on adapting it to better support digital technologies. Proposals must also describe a work plan to undertake the initial validation of their proposed improvement.
The following application areas of interest have been identified by the SJU:
Application area 1: ATM cyber-crisis management
The cybersecurity requirements of the ATM data systems are very high, but it is nevertheless necessary to ensure that if a cyberattack were to be attempted, the system would be ready to ensure the safety of the system at all times, and resume normal operations as soon as possible. Bids must propose one or more cyber-crisis management strategies that include the whole crisis lifecycle (readiness, response and recovery), and a plan to validate them. It is expected that the network analysis models used in other industries can be useful for ATM. Projects working in this area must consider the business aspects of their proposed applications.
Application area 2: ATM data management
The decentralization of the ATM system will bring with it the distribution of data management responsibilities among multiple actors. There is a need to establish requirements that ensure that the data are correctly stored and that the transmission of data is carried out in a secure and fully traceable way. Bids should describe a specific ATM data management challenge and hypothesize one or more novel ways to store and transmit ATM data so that the security and traceability is improved above what is considered in IR (with the SWIM profiles), and propose a plan to validate their hypothesis. It is expected that the generic data encryption solutions that are in use in other industries (e.g. block-chain, smart contracts, quantum-based cryptography, etc.) will be useful for ATM.
Application area 3: Collaborative cybersecurity awareness
The concept of the aircraft downlinking to the ground CNS cybersecurity status information (e.g. jamming, spoofing) is included in the scope of IR Wave 2 (Candidate Solution 110). Bids could propose additional applications that extend this concept, e.g. aircraft sharing cybersecurity status with other aircraft rather than the ground, or to a commercial cybersecurity monitoring service (not necessarily the ATM system).
Application area 4: Interaction between cybersecurity management and safety management in ATM
Similarly to what is done through safety management systems in the area of safety, there is a need to share cybersecurity information in order to ensure that the information and lessons learned from previous incidents is used for the continuous improvement of the system. However, unlike for safety, access to cybersecurity-related information needs to be controlled in order to avoid that sensitive information ends up in the hands of potential attackers. In addition, in the aviation there is a need to consider the trade-off between security measures and safety requirements, e.g. an encrypted ADS-B-in may be more secure if used by the ground, but may become unusable by other aircraft for ADS-B-in applications. Bids should elaborate on one or more of the challenges posed by the interaction between cybersecurity and safety in ATM, hypothesize one or more potential solutions and describe a plan to validate their hypotheses. The output of the project should be a public deliverable with detailed guidance material on how to address these issues.
The above list of potential applications is not intended as prescriptive; bids addressing applications not listed above are welcome, provided adequate background and justification are provided in the bid.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the research in this topic paves the way for a future distributed, service oriented ATM architecture that will make extensive use of digital technologies while respecting agreed safety targets and defence and security needs."

Automatic air-ground trajectory synchronization is a cornerstone of the SESAR vision. This topic explores the evolution of the operational concept of air-ground synchronisation concept beyond what can be achieved with ATN B2.
Scope:
The automatic sharing of data between the airborne systems and the ATM ground systems in the Industrial Research programme is limited to what is possible with the ATN B2 standard; it includes the downlink of the Extended Projected Profile (EPP) and the interrogation/reply related to the ETA min/max window over a waypoint, as well as the data that are downlinked via SSR Mode-S. The evolution from ATN B2 and current Mode-S will further extend the scope of automatic air/ground data exchange. This could include, for example:
Automatic update of the FMS trajectory with the ATC ground plan when a clearance is not yet possible, allowing the airborne systems to better optimise against that plan (e.g. more efficient descent profiles thanks to the information on the ground expected clearance).
Automatic uplink and update of the AMAN planned times, so that the flight crew can be aware at all times of what the arrival time that ATC has planned for them, and optimise the flight accordingly.
Automatic uplink and update of the relevant arrival and departure sequence, to increase the situational awareness of the flight crew (so that they know who their flights preceding and succeeding them on the sequence are) and facilitate ADS-B-in applications (no need for the controller to give aircraft-to-follow callsign).
Automatic “instantaneous” (e.g. via Mode-S or ADS-B) downlink of the flight-mode (managed-manual/selected), to improve the interpretation by the ground-system of the EPP information, e.g. for the ground to be able to predict the next level-off.
Evolution of the EPP standard, e.g. to include the vertical constraints that have been entered in the FMS, selected approach procedure, planned stabilisation speed (in support of compression management on final approach).
The main output of this project must be a high-level “Automatic air-ground trajectory synchronization CONOPS”, which must be included together with its supporting documentation in a deliverable marked as open for public dissemination. The “Automatic air-ground trajectory synchronization CONOPS” will be used as an input to the SESAR concept of operations, and also as an input for the future industrial research projects working in these areas.
The exchange of information that is not directly related to the ATC plan for the flight or to the trajectory itself is out of scope, e.g. downlink of aircraft as a sensor information is out of scope.
The project team must include both technical and operational expertise. Bids must demonstrate basic awareness of the future A/G communication infrastructure (which is supported by LDACS, Satcom and AeroMACS operating under a multilink approach) and which will support the future A/G voice and Data Link communications.
There is a dependency between this CONOPS and the controller-pilot communications CONOPS, which will be developed by a project in this call awarded under topic 23 Proposals addressing this topic should plan effort to coordinate with projects potentially awarded under topic 23. The project must also plan effort to bring the output of their research to ICAO as part of the dissemination of their work.
Expected Impact:
Improved automatic air-ground synchronization will increase the predictability of flight operations on the ground, enable the optimisation of flight profiles in order to reduce fuel consumption and contribute to a more efficient organisation of the entire mobility system."

Even though the remote pilot of an IFR RPAS may be located anywhere in the world, control from a ground station that is not in direct radio line-of-sight will generally increase communication latency, which may require ATC to apply extended separation buffers for RPAS, especially during approach, take-off and landing, where ATC is more dynamic, or it may even render TMA operations impossible. The challenge is to integrate IFR RPAS in the busy TMA and airport environments, beyond the level that is currently being research in the industrial research programme.
Scope:
The industrial research programme is researching the accommodation and integration of IFR RPAS in the airspace and at the airport, with a focus on accommodation and integration of the demand expected in the 2025-2035 time-frame. Research being conducted in Wave 1 by PJ.10-05 and the awarded scope of work in Wave 2 are expected to be publicly available at the end of 2019. This comprises almost exclusively IFR RPAS that operate from either military bases or dedicated airfields, where the remote pilot can control the aircraft via a radio line-of-sight C2 link. For take-off and landing, it is expected that large separation buffers may be required. The research that will be carried out in this exploratory research topic will pave the way for IFR RPAS to be able to fly to and from any airport in full integration with manned aircraft, i.e. eliminating or greatly reducing the separation buffers.
The aim of the research is to establish high-level requirements to allow the control of IFR RPAS for flight in the TMA, take-off and landing to allow enough flexibility for the IFR RPAS to safely operate in busy environments, even if some separation buffers above those applicable for manned aircraft are applied. The research must include the consideration of all the instructions that are usually issued by ATC in a busy airport (considering in particular take-off and landing clearances) and TMA environment (e.g. headings, speed control, approach take-off and landing clearances, stop-take-off instruction after take-off roll has been initiated, missed approach clearances, late go-around clearances, etc.).
C2 latency is always a key consideration for the integration of IFR RPAS in any airspace, because it has an impact on how quickly an ATC instruction can be implemented. In order to get low-latency control during take-off and landing, the traditional split operations concept requires the command and control for take-off and landing to be carried out by a local flight-crew using a line-of-sight C2 link. This system poses limitations to where the IFR can fly (a flight-crew and their supporting infrastructure must be line-of-sight from the departure and destination airports). The research could explore the possibility of establishing a C2 gateway at the airport to enable that the C2 communications be routed from a pilot located anywhere in the world via ground-ground communications into the airport RPAS C2 gateway, from which they would be routed through a line-of-sight radio link. This will enable the control of the aircraft from take-off at one airport to landing at another airport from a single ground control station, while enjoying line-of-sight C2 at both ends.
The research may also research the impact of RPAS using automatic take-off and/or landing systems, i.e. which added buffers may be needed for IFR RPAS that are untethered (no human-in-the-loop) during routine take-off and landing, but where a human may be available to intervene in non-nominal cases.
Research into DAA and RWC is out of the scope for this topic.
The output of this project must include the high-level operational requirements to support the operation of IFR RPAS in the (busy) TMA environment in integration with manned aircraft, and include performance quantification and a proposed technical architecture.
Consortia bidding for this topic must have both technical RPAS C2 expertise, operational RPAS expertise and air traffic control expertise. The research may include mock-up simulations/demonstrations involving controllers and remote pilots.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that the research in this topic paves the way for the integration of IFR RPAS with manned aviation in the TMA and tower environment beyond what is currently being research in the industrial research programme."

SESAR industrial research is working on the accommodation and integration of IFR RPAS in airspaces A-C, where the separator is always ATC. This topic explores the integration in airspaces D-G, where for IFR aircraft the separator may not always be the controller.
The aim is to provide the technical capabilities or procedural means to allow IFR RPAS to operate in airspace Class D to G where not all traffic may be known to ATC and/or where VFR traffic operates with less predictability (i.e. even if they are known their intentions may be unknown).
Scope:
For an IFR RPAS to be able to safely operate in airspace classes D-G, cooperative and non-cooperative Detect and Avoid (DAA) systems are required for avoidance of other traffic, but there is no need to consider obstacles or weather, as these are covered by normal IFR provisions. The research must be focused on the development of the DAA functions that are required for IFR RPAS to be able to fly among manned VFR aircraft but are not required to fly among manned IFR aircraft.
Collision-avoidance work shall cover both cooperative and non-cooperative conflicts, including, where appropriate, interoperability with ACAS-Xu and TCAS. Research should consider the relay of resolution advisories to the remote-pilot station, as well as the possibility for the system to implement such advisories without reference to the remote-pilot station. In both cases, all aspects concerning system and link performance should be researched, as well as the technical and human implications of greater degrees of automation.
The capability that needs to be developed is the Remain Well Clear (RWC) function for IFR RPAS. RWC aims at allowing IFR RPAS to execute RWC manoeuvres to maintain separation against cooperative and potentially non-cooperative traffic. It must be noted that this RWC function is neither a safety net aimed at last-minute collision avoidance nor a mere display of the surrounding traffic for situational awareness, but an operational concept to allow IFR RPAS to self-separate from other aircraft just like VFR pilots separate from other aircraft based on their out-the-window view.
EUROCAE has published an operational concept [83] for how the RWC function for IFR RPAS will use these capabilities in airspaces D-G. Proposals must describe how their project will undertake the initial validation and refinement of the concept in EUROCAE document. The role of autonomous decision-making and the system performance requirements, including end-to-end requirements for the link (RLP), must be considered.
Please note that the RWC function addressed in this topic is not aimed at allowing the pilot to discharge the responsibility for the safety of its own aircraft described in ICAO Annex II, which refers to collision avoidance only and display of surrounding traffic information (also referred to as RWC, but not allowing the remote pilot to manoeuvre unless it is for collision avoidance purposes). The ICAO Annex II responsibilities for IFR aircraft are fully discharged with the collision avoidance solution is expected to be developed in IR Wave 2 (candidate solution 111) being developed, which are being researched in the SESAR Industrial Research programme.
The research must consider how the European concept will be impacted by the existing difference between Europe and the USA concerning the responsibility of IFR pilots when operating with unknown VFR aircraft in class E. Both rotary-wing and fixed-wing RPAS must be considered.
The research may consider the definition of a new framework with different airspace classes for which there are different non-cooperative detection requirements, e.g. depending on the requirements for equipage for manned aviation or for non-IFR drones. Special considerations may be needed to accommodate drones that may transition from IFR flight rules to non-IFR rules to fly using U-space services or vice versa.
Development of non-cooperative detection is out of the scope of this solution (it is in the scope of topic 24, CNS)
The relevance of previous research undertaken in SESAR in the area of ASAS and CAVS will be considered.
The research will need to develop minimum performance requirements for non-cooperative detection, and may need to develop enablers that meet those requirements.
The project must consider the following references: EUROCAE WG-105 documentation, EUROCAE WG-75 documentation, documentation from EDA projects MIDCAS, DASA and RPS, JARUS documentation and ICAO RPAS Panel. The output of this project should propose a refinement of the WG-105 DAA for airspaces D-G CONOPS (EUROCAE ED-258).
The project is expected to reserve effort to participate to standardization and ICAO working groups as part of their communication and dissemination activities.
Expected Impact:
The integration of RPAS in all classes of airspaces is part of the European ATM Master Plan, and contributes to the access and equity key performance area, which aims at ensuring that all airspace users have equal access to the airspace."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research in this topic will develop the procedures for the management of the contingency of an aircraft flown by a single pilot needing ground control support. The concept will contribute to the safety of the operations currently conducted with two crew members that are expected to be conducted by one crew member only, and also enhanced the safety of those flight operations that are today conducted by a single crew member.
Scope:
It is anticipated that the reduced crew operations contingency management concept will require the ATM system accommodation of flights transitioning from a routine manned flight to a flight with limited on-board human action and the management of the flight thereafter. The research must address the management of the transition from manned flight to a (completely or partially) remotely piloted flight from the air traffic management perspective, and the management of the flight until it lands safely in a dedicated aerodrome as soon as possible, rather than on mission completion.
The research should consider how concepts, procedures and technologies from development in RPAS integration could support this activity. Different levels of airborne support function (human monitoring, alerting, crosscheck/confirmation management, auto-emergency aircraft control) may be considered.
Consortia submitting proposals(s) for this topic must have human factors in the cockpit expertise and air traffic control human factors expertise. The research may include mock-up real-time simulations involving pilots, remote pilots and controllers. The research must focus on the ATM aspects only and in the manned to ground-managed contingency management only; research into the wider reduced crew operations concepts is explicitly excluded (note that this is considered in all projects researching the future ATM system).
Expected Impact:
The reduced crew operations contingency management enhances the safety of flight operations with a single pilot."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
It is expected that the introduction of new delivery technologies such as drones, and mobility as a service will alter mobility which will result in large improvements in the quality of urban living. These unmanned aerial systems (UAS) require new kind of services. U-space services provide services to UAS flying without services from ATM, but may take place in airspace shared with manned aviation, some of which may be receiving ATC services. This exploratory research challenge refers to the development of new U-space services (especially in the more advanced U3 and U4 service levels), as well as to the linked regulatory challenges.
Scope:
Proposals must include research activities leading to further development of the U-space concept. The following non-exhaustive research areas of interest have been identified by the SJU:
Application area 1: use of U-space services by general aviation
The objective is to research if U-space services that are being developed for drones may also be useful for manned aviation, including general aviation. This could include access to local weather information, dynamic obstacle data bases, information on planned or active drone activity, geo-fenced volumes or additional services provided to the drone community via a ground-based data communications network.
Application area 2: Common altitude reference
UAS must be able to keep clear of each other, and of manned aircraft using the same airspace. To ensure vertical separation from these aircraft, it is essential that they use the same altitude reference. They must also be able to keep clear of objects on the ground - buildings, cranes, trees, etc. - and of course people and property in general. Their pilots (or their on-board flight controllers) need, therefore, to be able to understand their height above the ground in an unambiguous way, to be able to relate this to databases of objects and terrain, and to the declared altitude of other aircraft.
EUROCONTROL and EASA have published a discussion paper and describes potential solutions, while identifying areas for additional research. Work under this topic should examine the EUROCONTROL/EASA discussion paper and augment its analysis in the light of additional investigation. It should also present final conclusions that propose a justified and tested solution to the common altitude reference issue.
Application area 3: Urban airspace rules
The largest concentration of drones is expected over large populated areas. This has led to the proposal that airspace above urban areas (e.g. up to 1000 ft. above) be declared drone-only airspace, where rules of the air do not apply (because there are no manned flights). Manned flights would still be possible (e.g. security forces, emergency services), but they would need special authorization, and proposals should be described about how this could safely be done without adversely affecting priority manned aviation. There are important challenges associated to this concept, both from the operational point of view and from the societal point of view (noise impact, acceptable accident rate). Research should also cover urban-specific issues such as, inter alia, C2 performance in a heavily built-up area, GNSS performance and the potential impact of micro-climates. Finally, models for the design and management of drone trajectories – fixed or otherwise – should be proposed and analysed to support potentially large numbers of simultaneous drone operations. Bids should review the existing literature and describe how their proposed work would address the existing challenges.
Application area 4: flight-planning and demand and capacity balancing for drones
As demand for drones over populated areas explodes, there will be a need for limiting the density of flights. Research should explore the initial U-space DCB concept, which may require drones to flight-plan and get approval before departure.
Application area 5: U-space separation management service
With increasing numbers of drones in flight, there may be a need to ensure that they remain separated from each other and from manned aviation. Note that this is distinct from the requirement to avoid collisions; this topic considers a formal process whereby drones are separated from other drones and manned aviation according to agreed concepts and minima, equating to the ICAO second layer of conflict management for manned aviation: separation provision. This research topic should consider under what circumstances separation provision will be necessary, and how it could be implemented. There is a need to establish who will be the separator (the drone itself or the U-space service), what the separation minima will be, and what the separation management processes will be. There is also a need to define when separation will be procedural (e.g. two drones on different routes can be deemed separated without needing to check their positions in real time), and when tactical separation will be applied (in which case the surveillance tracks must be separated beyond defined separation minima). For tactical separation, it is necessary to establish who will take the role of the separator (the U-space service or the drone), and what are the performance requirements needed by communications, navigation and surveillance systems to support the provision of tactical separation. For procedural separation, navigation performance requirements will need to be developed. The research should also consider how such separation services should behave when airspace is shared with manned aviation, with and without ATC. Finally, it should consider how separation services relate to complementary collision-avoidance technologies and procedures.
Application area 6: Drone traffic management for airports
It is expected that large airports will operate fleets of drones in support of airport operations, e.g. for runway and lighting inspection. Research will develop an airport drone management concept that ensures that airport drones can perform their function without posing a risk to operations at the airport.
The research should assess the feasibility and potential benefits of large airports operating fleets of drones in support of airport operations (e.g. for transporting spare parts or high value cargo, for runway and lighting inspection, etc.)
In particular, the research must develop of how airport service drones could be managed, de-conflicted, in order to smoothly move around their allocated areas in a safe and efficient manner.
Please note that the development of geofencing aspects are out of the scope of this research topic (they are already covered by GEOSAFE l). However, proposals in this area may develop geofencing requirements specific for airport service drones if they deem them necessary.
The U-space research areas described above do not constitute a prescriptive list; proposals addressing research outside of the research areas on the list are welcome, provided adequate justification and background are provided in the bid.
Projects working in this area must be willing to share information with one another and reserve effort for coordination with other projects in this area and with SJU activities that bring together all U-space research efforts (e.g. U-space demonstrations).
Expected Impact:
Advanced U-space services will enable the safe and efficient operations of large numbers of drones without adversely affecting manned aviation."

There is a need to assess the ATM benefits that can be derived from further usage of TP enhancements for supporting tools (derived from the use of ADS-C data, including EPP), notably in terms of enhancement of conformance monitoring, improvement of predictability, reduction of tactical interventions and improvement of de-confliction of traffic.
Scope:
This VLD will continue the work performed by previous projects (PEGASE, DIGITS/DIGITS-AU) to demonstrate the ATM benefits from further usage of ADS-C reports, including EPP data, that are downlinked from aircraft operating routine revenue (airline) flights across Europe to the ground systems. In Wave 3, the objectives of this demonstration would be to:
Complete the progressive integration of more ADS-C data in operational ground ATC systems,
Derive deeper analysis of the associated operational benefits,
Demonstrate the feasibility of an efficient capture and distribution of ADS-C data to multiple ground consumers, in support of the Service Oriented Architecture vision in the ATM Master Plan,
Demonstrate the use of SATCOM capabilities to for the downlink of 4D trajectory data in ground systems.

The ATM Master Plan (ATM-MP) is the roadmap driving the modernisation of the European ATM system and connecting the different SESAR research and development activities. The ATM Master Plan has three levels (Executive, Planning and Implementation) that require synchronised monitoring and alignment. The related challenges that have to be addressed by the project:
Ensuring seamless transition from R&D results (SESAR Releases) to deployment activities;
Addressing key issues related to the Architecture at MP level;
Achieving consistency between the three levels of the MP;
Maximising levels of complementarity between the MP (“planning view”), Common Projects (“business view”) and the Deployment Programme which will be maintained by the Deployment Manager (“project view”) for those MP elements that will be deployed via “Common Projects”;
Providing sufficient stakeholder commitment to the process and results.

The main scope of the Master Plan Maintenance project is to support the delivery of up-to-date maintenance of the ATM MP and the alignment of its three levels. This includes ensuring that the ATM performance needs and expectations are correctly established at the highest level and can flow into the programme to drive R&I and deployment prioritisation (in close collaboration with the Content Integration project). To that end, the project shall organise the work supporting delivery for the following activities in support and under the leadership of the SJU and its governance bodies:
Master Plan: To support the management of the Master Plan campaign (one campaign is expected to be conducted before 2020) and publish the adopted ATM-MP Editions, starting from the SESAR Solutions outline the essential and other operational and technological changes that will enable SESAR to contribute to achieving the SES high-level goals and to manage the ATM-MP portal;
Deployment packaging and scenario development (incl. incentives): To identify which changes that need to be grouped / synchronised to optimise the benefit of their deployment and to consider incentives principles, regulations and standards needed to secure their deployment;
Performance Planning (Needs): performance needs for the medium to long term time horizons;
Implementation Planning and Monitoring (ATM MP Level 3): translates relevant Level 2 information of the ATM MP into an implementation view (Level 3). While the overall responsibility of the Master Plan is assigned to the SJU, there will be a need for a very strong coordination with the Deployment Manager from this perspective;
Support for definition of Common Projects;
Regulation: identification of the links with existing regulation and potential needs for new regulatory actions and regulatory roadmap maintenance;
Standardisation: assessment of standardisation needs and timelines and standardisation roadmap maintenance;
Business Cases: demonstrate a positive Business Cases (BC) while identifying specific negative BC situations.

At capacity constrained airports traffic demand for runway operations exceeds the runway capacity. With the growth in air traffic there is an increasing number of airports that are becoming capacity constrained for significant periods of each day. This situation becomes more critical when the weather conditions are adverse. Airports are additionally constrained by different operational constraints (European, National and local) aiming at minimizing the noise impact on citizens living around airports. Therefore, there is a key need to improve the efficiency of runway operations. Resilience of operations in visually challenging conditions requires improvement by ensuring consistent runway occupancy profiles across visually challenging conditions. Current static ICAO Wake Vortex separation minima are generic (i.e. the same for all airports), to be more efficient Wake vortex separation minima should be tailored for each airport taking into account their fleet-mix. In order to realise full benefits of reduced wake-vortex and time-based separation (TBS) minima it is necessary to reduce Minimum Radar Separation. Runway Occupancy Time (ROT) is a constraining factor for runway throughput in mixed mode operations. The full integration with ROT, wake, TBS, integrated arrival and departure management (AMAN/DMAN) and system support needs to be achieved. The optimisation of runway in reduced visibility conditions and, more specifically, the planning of operations as well as the way MET information is used in planning need to be addressed.
Scope:
The project “Increased Runway and Airport throughput” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Wake Turbulence Separation Optimisation: The application of reduced separations will require the use of an Optimised Runway Delivery tool so Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) can deal with various runway throughput enhancement concepts.
Enhanced arrival procedures: Mitigation of noise and adaptation of wake avoidance procedures through concepts such as multiple runway aiming points and glide slope increase.
Minimum Pair Separations based on Required Surveillance Performance (RSP): Reduction of separation minima is strictly dependent on the availability of accurate aircraft position data i.e. RSP concept.
Independent Rotorcraft (RC) operations at the airport: development of RC specific approach procedures and Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS)-based Point-in Space (PinS). RC Approach Procedures with Vertical Guidance (APV) and PinS approach procedures to improve access into secondary airports in Low Visibility Conditions (LVC).
Improved access into secondary airports in low visibility conditions: improve access into secondary airports in low visibility conditions through the development of an affordable surveillance solution.
Traffic optimisation on single and multiple runway airports: by increasing predictability of runway capacity, optimizing runway configuration and optimizing arrival and/or departure spacing.
Enhanced Runway Conditions Awareness: Improvement of safety and situational awareness through the prediction of degradation of runway conditions taking into account different data in order to improve the quality of ROT prediction. ROT prediction will be fed to AMAN/DMAN and Surface Management tools.
Enhanced Terminal Area for efficient curved operations: Using geometric vertical navigation guidance in the TMA will remove the workload associated to barometric to geometric vertical navigation transition.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Maintain or increase runway safety levels, increase situational awareness. ATC Workload maintained or reduced;
Airport and Airspace Capacity - Increase runway and airspace throughput (e.g. reducing runway occupancy time, or landing and departure wake turbulence separation) and mitigate the impact of head and cross winds plus reduced visibility;
Improve access to secondary airports. The opportunity to realize higher system robustness, with improved continuity of service under low visibility conditions at the airport (CATII/III) and with expected benefits for resilience, cost-efficiency and providing increased flexibility under non-nominal conditions at the airport.
Predictability - Increasing predictability and airport efficiency (e.g. of the landing rate, of Runway Occupancy Time, runway exit and departure rotation);
Environmental Sustainability - Reducing fuel consumption and noise in the vicinity of an airport."

Current airport infrastructures and services provided to Airport Stakeholders need to be optimised further to support the expected increase in traffic and potential integration of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) preventing a negative impact on the performance of the overall Air Traffic Management (ATM) network. With increases in traffic, airports and airlines need to enhance their abilities to deliver, plan and improve the use of airport resource allocation so that costs, emissions and fuel use can be reduced, whilst improving passenger satisfaction. Further integration of Air Traffic Control (ATC) tools through Surface Management with other systems could enable this. The process is not end to end, and the delivery from Stand to Runway or Runway to Stand could be further optimised through enhanced and integrated Surface management. Arrival and departure planning systems need to fully take advantage of advanced surface management functions or providing optimisations, so the controller is required to manage these separate processes with less ability to react to unknown variances which result in non-optimal delivery. Low visibility conditions impact negatively vehicle drivers as well with consequence of reducing their situational awareness in the aerodrome overall picture. In this context the use of Enhanced Vision System (EVS) and Synthetic Vision System (SVS) is an opportunity, but appropriate ATC procedures are required in order to make ATCOs, pilots and vehicle drivers able to manage safely operations using these technologies.
Scope:
The project “Integrated Surface Management” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Enhanced Guidance Assistance to Aircraft and Vehicles on the Airport Surface Combined with Routing: The procedures for the surface traffic management need to be validated with the new systems. Exchange of virtual stop bar identifier and status between ATCOs and flight crews to improve safety in low visibility conditions. The exchange of information between ATC and vehicles/aircrafts will be improved with the use of airport data link and other guidance means.
Enhanced navigation and accuracy in low visibility conditions (LVC) on the airport surface: definition and evaluation of advanced aircraft automated systems (integration with future ATC surveillance systems is also expected for surface operations). Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmented system can be used to improve the accuracy of aircraft navigation (position, speed and time) in both surface movement and take-off/landing operations. Inside the GNSS augmented system, a secure Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) solution, through the integration of “safety-of-life” / Public Regulated Service (PRS) receivers in the GBAS Ground Station in order to improve the accuracy of aircraft (a/c) navigation.
Enhanced Visual Operations: Enhanced Vision System (EVS) and Synthetic Vision System (SVS) will be developed to enable more efficient taxi, take-off and landing operations in low visibility conditions. This is applicable to all platforms and, even if main airline platforms have auto-land capabilities to facilitate approaches in low visibility conditions, they have no capabilities to facilitate taxi and take-off in order to maintain airport capacity. For Business Aviation, to maximize the benefits offered by System Based Augmentation System with Vertical Guidance SBAS/LPV, EVS and SVS (either head up or head down) to allow access to small airports in close to CAT II, CAT III visibility conditions. Work will address taxi, take-off and landing operations.
Surface operations by Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS): As RPAS enter service their ability to operate on an airport surface alongside manned platforms will become increasingly important. The project will examine the particular requirements of remotely piloted operations, and describe the differences from manned operations, providing operational requirements for technological developments that could mitigate those differences.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Improving flight efficiency in particular under low visibility procedures;
Reduction of fuel emissions per flight by reducing overall arrival, surface and departure delay;
Reduction of pilot workload in case of low visibilities conditions;
Improvement in both pilots’ and controllers’ situational awareness.
Increasing of the aircraft safety on the airport surface, the better situational awareness provided by vision systems in low visibility conditions will reduce the probability of occurrence of hazardous situations."

Runway excursions represent the most frequent accident category for worldwide accidents for the 2004-2009 period (IATA 2004-2009 RE Analysis report). Although a number of actions have been taken in the past to reduce the number of runway incursions, prevent collisions on the apron and taxiway with traffic and fixed obstacles, there is still potential to improve safety, especially as the airport surface becomes more congested. Enhanced safety nets for controllers in particular require improvements regarding conflict resolution functions and integration of weather aspects. There is also a need to consider airports with limited or no surface surveillance capabilities. Traffic alerts provided by the on-board system to the flight crews need to be extended in case of a risk of collision with an aircraft or a ground vehicle on runway and taxiways.
Finally, safety nets are the most demanding applications in terms of core surveillance performances. There is a need to further work on surveillance in order to reduce the false alerts rate including the study of possible new sources such as visual docking (when aircraft are at the Gate and current surveillance is an issue), or video-based surveillance.
Scope:
The project “Airport Safety Nets” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Enhanced Airport Safety Nets for Controllers: Safety alerts for controllers: the system detects potential and actual conflicting situations, incursions and non-conformance to procedures or ATC clearances, involving mobiles (and stationary traffic) on runways, taxiways and in the apron/stand/gate area as well as unauthorized / unidentified traffic.
Conformance monitoring safety net for Pilots: Conformance monitoring safety alerts for the flight crew (either generated by the on-board system or uplinked from the controller alerting system): the system detects non-compliance with airport configuration (e.g. closed runway, non-compliant taxiway, restricted area…) as well as non-conformance to procedure or clearances.
Traffic Alerts for pilots for airports operations: The on-board system detects potential and actual risk of collision with other traffic during runway and taxiway operations and provides the flight crew with the appropriate alert.
Safety support tools for runway excursions: The system provides support and alerts to the controllers and/or pilots in case of risk of runway excursion (take-off and landing).
Expected Impact:
Improve ground and air safety levels."

When SESAR trajectory-based operations and new separation modes are introduced existing ground safety nets should be effective and provide alerts of actual or potential hazardous situations. Current Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) performance requirements are based on present modes of separation and will need to be adapted for the future operations identified by the SESAR Concept. The adaptation of ACAS to new separation modes and to new categories of airspace users has to be studied. There is a need to anticipate the required evolution of ACAS for the future operations in Europe and take into consideration potential adaptations. The current strategy is to contribute to ACAS X development and standardisation. ACAS X is a set of FAA collision avoidance systems currently under development: ACAS Xa for normal operations of Commercial Air Transport (CAT), ACAS Xo for specific operations of CAT, ACAS Xu for RPAS operations and ACAS Xp for GA/RC operations. A priority issue is the analysis of the ACAS X systems operational and pilot acceptability.
Currently alerts that occur in the air and on the ground in close time proximity can lead to overlapping decisions by pilots and ATCOs (e.g. reactions to close Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) alerts and Airborne Collision-Avoidance System (ACAS) resolution advisories). Indeed, existing Ground Safety Nets have been developed independently from airborne Safety Nets (in particular ground-based SNETs have been implemented in a local context while ACAS has been implemented globally) and therefore the operations resulting from their alerts are not always compatible.
Overall, there is a need to adapt the safety nets to the changing environments in order to avoid:
lack of capacity to timely identify hazardous situations which will increase with the traffic;
Insufficient consideration of the new traffic patterns and of operations with reduced spacing, which could result in undesired alerts.
It is required to address the integration of: GA/ Rotorcraft and Civil Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS).
Scope:
The Project “Enhanced Air and Ground Safety Nets” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Enhanced ground-based safety nets adapted to future operations: Adapt ground-based safety nets to future trajectory management and new separation modes through the use of new surveillance means and wide information sharing ensuring the role of last ATC safety layer against the risk of collision and other hazards, while minimising negative operational interactions between ACAS and STCA.
Enhanced Airborne Collision Avoidance for Commercial Air Transport normal operations- ACAS Xa: Improve current Airborne Collision Avoidance for Commercial Air Traffic by taking benefit of optimized resolution advisories and of additional surveillance data, without changing the cockpit interface.
Airborne Collision Avoidance for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems – ACAS Xu: Provide Airborne Collision Avoidance to RPAS taking benefit of optimised resolution advisories and of additional surveillance data, but taking into account the operational specificities of the RPAS. The additional surveillance sources could be ADS-B but also any other sensor installed on the RPAS.
ACAS for Commercial Air Transport specific operations– ACAS Xo: Improve Airborne Collision Avoidance taking benefit of optimised resolution advisories and of additional surveillance data while avoiding unnecessary triggering of RAs in new separation modes, in particular if lower separation minima are considered. (new separation modes include ASAS applications but may include other solutions).
Airborne Collision Avoidance for General Aviation and Rotorcraft – ACAS Xp: Provide Airborne Collision Avoidance to GA/RC, taking into account the limited capability of GA to carry equipment and its operational specificities.
Expected Impact:
The main goal is to increase safety, reducing the number of ATM related accidents and incidents.
The project will provide inputs and influence the work on Ground / Airborne Safety Nets at global and regional standardisation level, within ICAO (in coordination with FAA for ACAS), EUROCAE and RTCA."

The successful integration of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), General Aviation (GA) and Rotorcraft with the Commercial Aviation is a key issue for the SES. A failure in reaching this integration, could result in restrictions to the accessibility for those classes of vehicles, or lead to issues that adversely affect safety (such as airspace infringements).
Currently, RPAS operations are not routinely integrated into the ATM environment and RPAS can only fly in segregated airspace. Moreover, there is a lack of regulations on the subject and the certification and flight-authorisation plans are fragmented and conducted at a national level.
It is required to ensure a cross-fertilisation of technical solutions between RPAS and General Aviation and Rotorcraft (GA/R) and this will be obtained thanks to a technical coordination between the project areas. This project shall focus on technical aspects that are unique to RPAS and GA/R, consistently with the user needs and the operational requirements expressed in other SESAR2020/SESAR1 projects.
Scope:
The technical solutions that will be addressed into the present project cover two main areas: integrated RPAS operations, and (GA/R) operations. It must be noted that solutions to be developed might and should be applicable to both areas.
In the area of enabling integrated RPAS operations:
Airborne Detect and Avoid (D&A) Systems supporting integrated RPAS operations: RPAS Detect & Avoid (D&A) addresses the ability of RPAS to replicate the human ability to see and avoid. It is essential to have this capability as it is one of the cornerstones of aviation called “rules of the air” in which the pilot is ultimately responsible for the safety of the flight.
Regarding systems to enable Integrated General Aviation and Rotorcraft (GA/R) operations in the European Air Traffic Management System:
GA/R Specific Communication Systems: development of future communication enablers that are very specific to GA/R needs and to enable their integration into the ATM datalink environment and to benefit from the datalink applications
GA/R Specific NavigationSystems: development of future navigation enablers that are very specific to GA/R needs and to enable their integration into performance based airspace
GA/R Specific Surveillance Systems: development of future surveillance enablers that are very specific to GA/R needs and to enabling their integration to the future ATM environment
GA/R Specific Information Management Systems: GA/R operations are dominated by single-pilot operations without an operations centre to support.Thus there is a need to ensure that the functions that the SESAR concept expects from an FOC can be reasonably carried out by such airspace users
As far as GA development is concerned, large airplanes with complex avionics are not considered as part of the scope (covered by other projects e.g CNS).
Expected Impact:
Safety: RPAS D&A is a critical component of ensuring safe, integrated operations of RPAS in non-segregated airspace.
Interoperability: RPAS D&A is required to ensure safe operations by unmanned platforms, but such systems must be interoperable with those of manned airspace users and not adversely impact such operations.
Access and Equity: Improve accessibility to airspace and airports for RPAS, GA and Rotorcraft users, whilst maintaining or increasing the safety level of operations.
Cost-effectiveness: Cost is an important driver for solutions in the areas of RPAS and GA."

Future environments of Airport Air Traffic Service (ATS), Terminal Manoeuvre Areas (TMA) and En-Route are anticipated to entail more information and be more complex. Improved Air Traffic Service will require substantially different management (notably using full business/mission trajectories) to work at the optimum efficiency, capacity and safety. Required improvement of Operations connected to an increased number of information sources will require automation and new tools to assist Airport ATS, TMA and En-Route Controllers, providing with all relevant information, at the right time, in an easy and intuitive way.
Possible separation of some ATM Information Providers from ATM Business Services providers to go towards a Virtual Centre (VC) approach requires a clear open and common service-oriented interface based on open architectures and technologies between the controller workstation and the related Information providers.
In today’s situation Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) usually host a monolithic ATM system in each Air Traffic System Unit (ATSU) with very few information services and infrastructure elements being shared between the different centres. In the Virtual Centre approach, the Controller Working Positions are decoupled and may even be geographically separated from the ATM information services that they consume, and these ATM information services may be shared between different ATSUs or even between ANSPs. The main benefits expected from the Virtual Centre approach are cost reduction and more flexibility to support load-balancing between the participating ATSUs. The development of technical services and common interfaces resulting from new technologies, working methods, Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and procedures would also need to address human factors considerations. The proliferation of proprietary systems with proprietary interfaces shall be avoided as well as the use of non-user friendly interfaces.
There is a need to increase the efficiency of using the CWP HMIs by exploiting the latest mature technologies. The project will thus be tasked with a transversal role related to HMI and human performance aspects. In this role, it will in particular need to investigate new HMI needs (response time, appearance and other characteristics) and interaction modes (touch, gesture, voice etc...) in relation to SESAR solutions and support the other ATM solution projects in integrating suitable new user interface technologies.
Scope:
The Project “CWP / HMI” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Work Station, Service Interface Definition & Virtual Centre Concept: This project will develop the ATSU architecture from a service oriented approach with a focus on the technical services and common interfaces. Based on the Virtual Centre concept, the CWP/HMI needs to interface with one or more information service providers or consumers. Open standard interfaces for the CWP will facilitate the achievement of the Virtual Centre, understood as an operating environment in which different Air Traffic Service Units, even across different ANSPs, will appear as a single unit. The Virtual Centre approach requires operational and technical interoperability between the participating units. The amount of exchanges is expected to be very high. A high performing and reliable underlying communication infrastructure may be needed. This solution encompasses En-route and TMA and airport/TWR environments.
Workstation, Controller Productivity: The project will develop guidance and assessment methods regarding HMI, will investigate new HMI needs and interaction modes in relation with SESAR solutions (including new user interface technologies such as speech recognition, multi-touch, gaze detection). The project will focus on technologies and interaction modes that are regarded as sufficiently mature.
Expected Impact:
Assuming that the infrastructure performance in terms of security, data integrity, response time, latency etc. is met, project will support the achievement of the following performance objectives:
Increased safety;
Increased ATCO efficiency;
Increased capacity;
Improved resilience;
Improved HMI and usability and performance of interactions;
Improved interoperability in Airports, TMA and En-Route domains."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The SESAR concept is based upon the fundamental element of trajectory sharing. The ultimate goal is a trajectory based ATM system where actors optimise business and mission trajectories through common 4D trajectory information taking into account users priorities and ATC constraints. The objective is the sharing of the trajectories between the ATM actors including Airspace Users through an iterative process to take into account more accurate data once available (e.g. intentions, MET forecast, current traffic, airspace management). This will allow the Airspace User to choose the preferred way of integrating ATM constraints when required.
The notion of Reference Business Trajectory (RBT) in trajectory based operation is also not well defined. There is a need to agree in more details on the elements that will constitute the RBT and understand how these will be used operationally.
Studies are needed to consolidate the global integration of military users' processes in the network and to consider additional Airspace Users (e.g. RPAS).
The new ATM Solutions will need better trajectory predictions and additional data exchanges between systems.
The ambition of new ATM Solutions is to manage a gate-to-gate trajectory, thus the surface (taxi) trajectory needs to have greater coherency with the airborne part of the trajectory, through better coordination of the stakeholders and systems.
Inconsistencies between various sources for aeronautical (AIM) and meteorological (MET) information will be further removed and so that airspace users, the Network Manager and ATC are enabled to establish a common operating picture with respect to the available infrastructure and the meteorological conditions.
It is required to facilitate the coherent design of solutions for managing flight information across the System of Systems architecture, driven by operational requirements elaborated in the various ATM SESAR solution projects.
Scope:
This project will define the trajectory management services fulfilling the requirements expressed by ATM Solution projects using trajectory aims through the following solutions:
Improved mission trajectories: to enable smooth integration of military operations in the ATM network. Improved and harmonised Operational Air Traffic (OAT). Mission Trajectories will be integrated in Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) environment throughout all phases of trajectory planning and execution (SMT/RMT).
Integration of trajectory management processes in planning and execution: to improve sharing of trajectory information and to clarify roles and responsibilities regarding Shared Business Trajectory (SBT) and RBT revision and update processes. Consolidation and extension of the trajectory and flight plan information exchange technical solution to provide the infrastructure enabling seamless operation and trajectory sharing in response to the need of the SESAR Solutions.
Management and sharing of data used in trajectory (AIM, METEO): to enable the use and integration in trajectory processes of the most up-to-date and suited information, in terms of quality of service requirements.
Performance-Based Trajectory Prediction: through data exchange between air and ground and the use of other sources in order to support all advanced operational processes required in S2020. The solution looks at how the trajectory predictions for ATC, FOC and NM can be improved taking into account all possible data sources (legacy or not).
Expected Impact:
The project will contribute to:
Interoperability by sharing the same trajectory view between air and all ground actors;
Predictability by improved trajectory accuracy and sharing information updates throughout the flight;
Flexibility by matching the trajectory with the Airspace User needs;
Flight efficiency: flight is managed closer to its optimal profile."

A generic principle of the SES and the SESAR programme is that, where services can be delivered in a harmonised manner, they should be done so. A Common Service is a service to consumers that provides a capability in the same form that they would otherwise provide themselves. The advent of service orientation and the use of open standards create opportunities for identifying such common capabilities amongst certain stakeholder groups and encourage their use in the de-fragmentation of ATM. Applicable to any capability supporting Air Navigation Services or their related functions, they can be provided at European, network, FAB, local or other level. The future high level architecture should offer an option for the de-fragmentation of the ATM system through the provision of harmonised or Common Services. Introducing a Common Service will change how a solution is delivered and this is likely to change organisational relationships between the stakeholders due to the provision and consumption of the new service. SESAR 2020 moves from the study phase to the examination of the business and physical impact of providing specific capabilities needed to support a Solution through the provision of a Common Service.
Scope:
The Project “Common Services” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Sub-regional Demand Capacity Balancing Service: the purpose of the Sub-regional Demand Capacity Balancing (DCB) Service is to facilitate an improved usage of the airspace at sub-regional level and facilitate tactical interventions when necessary, ensuring that any potential disruptions could be correctly managed. The scope also includes an AOP Common Service to facilitate the integration of AOP information into the NOP.
Delay Sharing Service: the XMAN Delay Sharing Service operates the AMAN functionalities within an extended horizon to provide local and overall arrival sequences for planning and tactical operational purposes in a cross border environment.
Trajectory Prediction Service: The function of the Trajectory Prediction (TP) Service is to compute and distribute an accurate and consistent 4D trajectory and update it as the flight progresses. The output could be used during different flight phases: to propose an initial reference trajectory in the planning phase, as input for DCM during the tactical phase or facilitate transfers during the operations phase.
Virtual Centre Service: The Virtual Centre Service aims to provide ATS (mainly ER/APP) within the union of airspace areas controlled by distinct ATSUs. By using standardised operating methods, procedures and technical equipment, the Service would be perceived as a unique system from the consumer’s perspective, rather than the current fragmented situation. The range and QoS of the ATS provided shall be the same as now, or even enhanced.
Static Aeronautical Data Service: The function of the Static Aeronautical Data Service is to provide static aeronautical data in digital form to be used by different ATM systems (e.g. Safety Nets). The output is an AIXM-compliant dataset whose subsets can be retrieved by individual requests demanding specific geographical areas, attributes or functional features.
Aeronautical Digital Map Service: The Aeronautical Digital Map Service provides digital maps ready to be used by different ATM systems (e.g. Safety Nets) when performing separation functions. The output is highly customizable in order to meet the different requirements from the consumers and easily convertible among different digital formats, as AIXM, GML, XML, etc.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to enhance the benefit of operational solutions, especially their cost effectiveness, by identifying opportunities to provide them through alternative organisational arrangements. This is achieved through the discovery, definition and validation of common services and their enabling elements in the operational solutions.
The main performance goal is cost-effectiveness achieved through economies of scale in in the provision of commonly required capabilities enabled by standard interfaces to the services that make them available to consumers. This will support lower overall lifecycle costs, including maintenance and training and encourage the introduction of more open markets and competition. Indirectly, the solutions developed within this project will contribute to achieve performance goals in ATM Solution projects related to: Safety, Environmental sustainability (fuel/energy efficiency, noise and emissions reduction), Capacity, Predictability and Security."

Specific challenge: Native and alien pests[1] cause increasing yearly losses to agriculture and forestry and plant production costs. Invasive alien species and new pests and diseases impact negatively on native species (e.g. outcompete), affect food chains, change biodiversity patterns and disrupt terrestrial ecosystems (including inland water bodies) and landscapes, with further impacts on economic and recreational activities. Climate change is expected to favour the permanent establishment of many alien pests and change the distribution of already established pests. The prevention of the entry, establishment and spread of new alien pests is regulated by the Directive 2000/29/EC. More environmental friendly approaches in pest and disease control are sought, in line with the Directive 2009/128/EC. Given the high costs associated with the prevention/controlling of pests and invasive alien species and the reduction of their environmental impacts, there is a need to further develop integrated mechanisms of response measures (practical solutions), ranging from prevention of entry to novel Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following issue (B):
B. [2014] EU-China cooperation on IPM in agriculture
Proposals should cover a number of farming systems (including organic) and aim at increasing productivity while preserving ecosystems and reducing pesticide residues in food. Pests affecting fruits and vegetables are of particular interest, when the exchange of information, best practices and technologies is a benefit for both EU and China farmers/growers and consumers. A variety of IPM practices should be sought to address pests, such as chemical ecology, biological control agents, intercropping, planning tools for farm and landscape, etc. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation and in particular with the implementation of the EU-China dialogue, the participation (also in terms of resources) of Chinese partners in research, innovation and demonstration activities is strongly encouraged[1]. Practical solutions for farmers/growers, close to the market, should be facilitated by the involvement of industry (including SMEs) aiming at IPM related technology transfer.

Specific challenge: Agricultural soils provide the basis for crop and animal production and in turn are impacted by the different types of land use, water quality, management practices, choice of crops, cultivars and genotypes. Effects include not only changes to chemical and physical soil properties but also to the composition of the soil biological community and plant-soil-microbial interactions.

The specific challenge here is to help attain high levels of precision in modern farming through the smart use of robotics. The technological challenge is to develop and demonstrate new robotics technologies in real-world scenarios involving such as automated mobility around irregular farmland areas, accurate sensing of crop and livestock conditions, and dextrous manipulation of farmed produce. Farming is facing many economic challenges in terms of productivity, cost-effectiveness and increasing labour shortage. Precision farming automation will increase farm productivity, reduce manual labour for laborious tasks and help to make farm holdings more sustainable. Many modern farmers already use high-tech solutions, e.g. digitally-controlled farm implements and even unmanned aerial vehicles. There are partially and fully automatic devices for most aspects of agricultural functions from grafting to seeding and planting, from harvesting to sorting, packaging and boxing, and livestock management. However, current systems still have significant drawbacks, in particular in terms of flexibility, efficiency, robustness, high operator cost and capital investment.
Precision farming using robotics technology applied to existing systems on a 1:1 scale where appropriate (the scale may differ according to the specific agricultural application) can lead to more resource-efficient and environment-friendly agricultural production. Roboticised precision farming not only promises to increase yields by optimising growth and harvesting processes, but could also lead to lower fertiliser and pesticide usage and improved soil quality through more targeted interventions. Robots can also gather operational data on a broader basis than human-operated devices. However, there is insufficient cross-over between emerging generic advances in field robotics and the more specific, practical needs of the modern farming community.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions will focus on the design, development and testing of robotics systems for precision farming, including autonomous or semi-autonomous farm vehicles or sophisticated sensors and intervention mechanisms. The actions will prioritise technologies such as selective harvesting, more targeted weed reduction or environment friendly fertilization, and / or livestock management, based on better planning and targeted intervention, using sensors (local and aerial, even maybe earth observation satellite). This will also allow the tagging of agricultural produce or livestock for better traceability and subsequent big data processing, optimizing the whole agricultural process.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

significant increase in farm productivity with more environment-friendly processes (e.g. reduced water use, toxic substance use and soil compaction);
increase in the safety, reliability and manageability of agricultural technology, reducing excessive human burden for laborious tasks.

","15 October 2019
","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
The increasing demand for animal derived food and the mounting pressure on land and oceans is expected to push further intensification and expansion of animal production in certain regions of the world. Contagious livestock diseases impede the efficiency of animal production and lead to economic costs, poor animal welfare, and in the case of certain diseases, have an impact on trade, consumer confidence and public health. While the impact of epizootic diseases and some other regulated contagious diseases is relatively well known due to the regulatory framework, the situation with non-regulated contagious diseases is poorly known, even less for diseases with multiple pathogens (disease complexes). It is up to the private sector to deal with them. There is a need to determine the prevalence of production related diseases, the burden of these diseases and to set up a framework to facilitate monitoring of the situation and enable improvements in risk assessments and prioritisation of disease control measures throughout the animal production chain, for the producers and their organisations, the private stakeholders in the livestock sector (e.g. veterinarians, animal health industry, animal breeding industry, food industry) and the public stakeholders (e.g. risk managers, funders).
Scope:
Activities will aim to harvest the knowledge inherently carried in existing data streams on contagious, non-EU-regulated, animal diseases, including diseases with multiple pathogens (disease complexes) and AMR. The proposals should address at least terrestrial livestock, while including marine and freshwater aquaculture whenever relevant, and should investigate the feasibility of addressing relevant wildlife. Data from different production systems should be included. Activities will look for ways to validate, integrate and process these data, including modelling, possibly generating additional useful information inferred from existing data and identifying new data that could be integrated in data streams. They will focus on identifying and characterising relevant data on diseases (including animals, pathogen and environment, including genomic and metagenomic data), context and consequences (e.g. performance), the various components of data streams and will assess opportunities and barriers to utilising or sharing information across countries and stakeholders throughout Europe. This should improve risk identification and determination of the burden and cost of non-regulated contagious diseases and effectiveness and efficiency of control measures. Relevant geospatial information and data on animal welfare and genetics, in so far as they can be connected to animal diseases, can be included in the planned activities.
Work shall explore the potential of precision farming and “big” data, cloud-based integrated data collection for the detection of hitherto undetected relations between symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, risk factors, control measures and spread of diseases as well as their associated burden and economic costs. They should test the feasibility and potential benefits of an integrated approach to knowledge extraction and decision support based on a specific risk scenario for a disease. Decision-makers involved at different levels in the management of diseases should be considered (e.g. producers, private stakeholders supporting diseases control plans at a collective level, public sector). Possible integration with farm management and information systems and (automated) decision support systems, should be explored. Development or refinement of existing risk-based approaches and early warning systems should be explored. The project will provide a coherent blueprint and a framework for the necessary changes to allow improved data utilisation to protect animal health and welfare, human health and the food chain in Europe. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[1], involving representatives of producers, veterinarians and other professionals from animal production and the food chain, as appropriate, and decision-makers.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Strategic utilisation of existing and development of new data streams will:
allow a clear view on occurrence and cost of disease and relation to welfare;
enable timely and evidence-based decision-making by stakeholders in public and private sectors, and potentially by producers. It will enable a more focused targeting of resources for controlling diseases;
provide a basis for potential rapid and early detection coupled with prediction of consequent losses,
facilitate educational strategies for animal disease and animal welfare management; identify gaps in human capital knowledge.

Specific challenge: Disease prevention and management are essential for the sustainability of the European aquaculture industry. The diversity of species and farming practices throughout Europe involves also a significant number of threats related to a large variety of pathogens that hamper production and require specific preventive and curative practices and tools ensuring a high level of biosecurity of aquaculture production and related seafood products. Among other disease-related threats, parasites and related infections can cause significant damages on farmed fish species and can result in poor growth performance, impaired welfare and death of farmed animals with significant consequences in terms of production and economic performance. Parasites can also affect the end users of aquaculture products and therefore their monitoring and eradication are essential for ensuring the safety of European consumers. The management of diseases is even more challenging in farmed aquatic mollusc where the absence of adaptive immune system further complicates the development of tools and methods allowing mitigating effects of diseases on production. Despite the initiatives that have been implemented to understand, explain and mitigate disease outbreaks affecting farmed molluscs, which seem to have multifactorial origins, the future of the European mollusc production sector is still challenged.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following issue (A):
A. [2014] Scientific basis and tools for preventing and mitigating parasitic diseases of European farmed fish
Proposals should focus on parasites with documented socio-economic impact on European finfish aquaculture production and on trade of products thereof. The main focus should be on the development of reliable, cost-efficient detection and diagnostic tools, as well as, preventive and curative practices, tools, medicines and treatments (adapted to relevant life stages and husbandry practices of related fish species) against (endo- and ecto-) parasites and related infections, for conventional and organic aquaculture. Proposals should also take into consideration parasitic transfer between wild and reared fish species and its mitigation. Finally, they should avoid any duplication with relevant other related research initiatives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 7 million for (A) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","Research and Innovation action
","27 October 2015
","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
Favourable conditions for disease development in the tropics and sub-tropics hit perennial crops[1] particularly hard, especially in uniform plantings. Overall, losses are thought to be 50 to 100% higher in tropical than in temperate regions; estimates of the former range from 30 to 50%.The effects of increased climatic variation are expected to further increase the occurrence of pests and diseases as well resistance against crop protection measures. This threatens to affect the production of many economically important crops and the incomes of small holders in particular.
Scope:
The work proposed will develop integrated approaches to the management of important pests and diseases of perennial tropical and sub-tropical crops. Activities will address gaps in our knowledge on the disease cycle including climatic and cultural factors that influence the cycle and changes in farming practices. They will develop more effective and sustainable management options which are based on a holistic view of agro-ecosystems and a better understanding of the bearing that climatic changes may have on plant diseases and their management. They should propose novel solutions to improve forecasting, monitoring and information on biotic threats. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[2] based on genuine collaborations between producers (including small farmers), researchers, advisory services and the commercial sector. Dissemination and demonstration of findings and outputs shall be given particular attention. The integration of social and economic sciences will support the uptake of new methods and tools in plant disease management and take into account the specificities of farming systems. International collaboration is essential to meet the requirements of the topic (see conditions for minimum number of participants under evaluation procedures in section ""Conditions for the SFS call"")
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Project outputs will result in an increased uptake of integrated disease management approaches. These will benefit sustainable production of important perennial crops in tropical and sub-tropical regions within Europe and elsewhere by:
delivering applicable knowledge on the biology of pests and diseases and on the disease cycle;
expanding the set of sustainable measures and tools available to farmers to prevent and deal with important pests and diseases;
reducing yield losses and stabilising production;
enhancing capacity in conventional and low-input farming sectors (including small holder farming) to apply more complex cultural practices, e.g. in line with integrated pest and disease management principles;
reducing reliance on critical pesticides in farming practices, thereby also supporting product quality and human health (e.g. that of applicators and consumers);
improving capacity of plant health authorities and advisory services to prevent diseases; and
triggering product, technology and service innovations in support of plant health and plant protection.
In the longer term projects will help to secure/increase productivity of important perennials in tropical and subtropical regions and at the same time reducing the environmental impact of agricultural activities. They will thereby strengthen the contribution of the agricultural sector to rural economies as well as overall economic and sustainable development.

Specific challenge: Risk assessment has long been the tool for science-based decision-making and has become an integral part of EU policy development. With regard to chemical hazards, there is increasing concern over the possible ‘cocktail effects’ of combined exposure to multiple food related toxic substances. The complex toxicology of chemical mixtures, and the diversity of the routes of exposure, call for the development of a more mechanism-based and quantitative framework for risk assessment estimating the impact on health, thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of safety evaluations.
Scope: The state-of-the-art frameworks already in place at international level should be reviewed in the quest for a harmonised, evidence- and risk-based approach. Proposals should focus on the health risks of combined exposures to multiple chemicals from multiple sources across differing life stages, while weighing the risks from chemical mixtures in diets against the health benefits from the same foods and taking into account also the gender dimension. New strategies should be developed, implemented and supported by the respectively developed software and databases and tested in operational environments – using, for example, ‘omics’ technologies, bioassay systems, mathematical modelling, quantitative structure-activity relationship models and threshold of toxicological concern – so that tiered approaches for testing can be followed and targeted testing protocols developed. Proposals should address responsible research and innovation aspects by developing strategies that will result in a reduction in the use of animals in toxicological research.

Animal diseases can cause serious social, economic and environmental damage and in some cases threaten human health. An increasing number of major disease problems or threats faced by the livestock industry and zoonoses are global in scale.
Improved coordination of and international cooperation on research is needed to expedite the development of better prevention and control methods, ensure the sustainability of livestock industries and protect human health.
Scope:
This global initiative will consolidate and deepen international research cooperation in the area of animal health, in particular infectious animal diseases, including zoonoses and parasites, and related issues such as anti-microbial resistance. It will build on existing activities of the STAR-IDAZ[1] global network of research programme owners and funding organisations by bringing together researchers and organisations investing in animal disease research (funding bodies) in order to achieve specific targets relating to the prevention and control of priority animal diseases and zoonoses and related issues such as anti-microbial resistance. The action will lead to the setting up of a scientific secretariat to provide organisational support for the achievement of the goals of the global infectious diseases of animals and zoonoses consortium (STAR-IDAZ) in close cooperation with the European Commission, and research-funding agencies in Member States and the third countries involved. It will involve assisting the consortium executive committee, establishing and running working groups on priority diseases and issues, and organising research gap analysis meetings. It will support information exchange among members of the participating organisations at all levels. It will communicate progress on consortium research, including collecting and disseminating pertinent information and results to the researchers funded by the consortium members.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project should contribute to achieving overall STAR-IDAZ goals. It will support cooperation in the consortium, including by organising meetings, internal and external communication, shared data, research results and common databases.
It will help mobilise and coordinate the global research effort to address the existing and emerging disease challenges, including anti-microbial resistance, and so hasten the delivery of new or improved control tools or strategies.
It will support more focused effort through research gap analysis, prioritisation, and alignment of research programmes and coordination of research activities, which over five years will result in new or improved disease-control tools, including vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, and/or critical scientific information informing efforts to control specific target diseases.
More generally and in the longer term, through providing support for STAR-IDAZ activities, it will contribute to the improvement of animal health internationally, to a decreased risk to human health from animal infections and related threats, while improving the efficiency and competitiveness of livestock production, and global food security.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating viral disease of swine which is endemic in Africa and has been present in Europe for several years, after its introduction from Trans-Caucasian countries. It is a transmissible disease that has the potential for very serious and rapid spread, irrespective of national borders. It has a serious socio-economic impact on farming sector and is of major importance in the international trade of animals and animal products. While in the EU, strict control measures including in particular biosecurity, culling of infected pigs, killing of wild-boars, have so far managed to contain the spread of the disease, restrictions on farming and trade remain. The threat is permanent (including incursion of exotic strains from endemic countries) and concerns are raised on the possibility to eradicate the disease without vaccination.
No vaccine is currently available and the development of effective and safe ASF vaccines is urgent as an additional tool to re-inforce control and eradication strategies currently in place. For details of potential strategies and possible research steps for vaccine development, see the blueprint and roadmap[1] produced by the EU Reference Laboratory for ASF.
Scope:
The research proposals will address the necessary steps for developing safe vaccines against ASF for domestic pigs and wild boars. Proposals should build on past or ongoing EU funded research and on current knowledge of the characteristics of the viruses and research gaps, with the overall purpose of developing pilot vaccines and their companion DIVA test. Activities should address vaccination as part of a control strategy in different scenarios and should consider the potential impact on animal production and trade. Particular focus should be put on the European situation and the role of wild boars in the spread of the disease, so the proposals should address at least the ASF viruses circulating in Europe, and may also cover all or the most relevant exotic ones. Wild fauna other than wild boars, that are involved in the epidemiology and for which vaccination may help control the disease, may also be addressed. Participation by non-EU regions particularly affected by ASF is recommended.
The selected project should take into consideration the EU animal health regulatory framework, and follow the policies and contribute to the objectives of the STAR-IDAZ international research consortium[2].
Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[3] and be based on the active participation of stakeholders from research, animal health authorities and the farming and business sectors. Involvement of the pharmaceutical industry is highly recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Pilot ASF vaccines and their companion DIVA tests for the possible prevention and/or eradication of the disease in domestic pigs and wild boars, at target TRL 5-6;
Contribution to international cooperation on animal health research, potentially reducing the threats from the introduction of exotic ASF virus strains in the EU and reducing the burden of ASF in countries outside the EU.
More generally, the selected project will contribute to a reduction of economic losses by the farming sectors and contribute to healthy livestock production. It will contribute to reduce the sanitary barriers to trade in swine and products therefrom.

","11 June 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: The occurrence of biological contamination in various crops is of major concern as it has major implications for food and feed safety, food security and international trade. Worldwide, it is estimated that mycotoxins are responsible for losses of up to 5-10% of crop production. Contaminations are due to a series of events including weather conditions,   possible climate change effects, land use, crop management and varieties as well as harvest and post-harvest techniques. Integrated approaches rather than isolated solutions are required to effectively control the incidence of mycotoxins in crops and reduce contamination throughout the feed and food chains.
Scope: Proposals should aim at reducing the risk of mycotoxin contamination in crops and all along the feed and food chains. They should bring about technical, management and organisational solutions that are effective at the various stages of production as well as at pre- and post-harvest levels and also deal with the safe use of contaminated batches. Proposals should take into account the development of ICT solutions as well as reliable and cost effective control tools and support policies in the area. Proposals should benefit conventional and organic supply chains and fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[1] and allow for adequate involvement of the farming sector in proposed activities. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation and in particular with the implementation of the EU-China dialogue, proposals are encouraged to include third country participants, especially those established in China[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3–5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         a toolkit (plant resources, management tools, technologies) to effectively monitor and reduce the incidence of mycotoxin contaminants in crop production as well as in the food and feed supply chains.

The simple, swift and reliable detection, accurate identification and proper quantification of pathogens and other factors affecting plant and animal health, including zoonotic agents, and correlates of infection (e.g. host-response biomarkers) and/or immunity are critical for the monitoring and control of their introduction or spread. These tools are essential to avoid or reduce costs to the economy, trade disruptions and sometimes even human health risks. The methods are used not only by competent authorities (i.e. the national authorities responsible for organising official controls), but also by private laboratories or directly by veterinarians at the point of care, practitioners and business operators.
In recent years, most research efforts have focused on the developing high throughput, generic, quick and cheap methods, a number of which have been validated on an intra-laboratory basis or through limited ring trials. Before they are used outside research laboratories, these methods often have to undergo additional testing, e.g. further ring tests, development of reference materials, harmonisation or adaptation for implementation in field conditions (sampling methods, multi-targeting, pen-side tests, mobile analysis).
Scope:
The projects aim to harmonise and validate (including through ring trials) existing and new protocols for the detection and quantification of pathogens and other factors of concern for the health of plants and terrestrial animals, and correlates of infection/immunity. Work will build on existing knowledge and resources, and support the further development of promising existing protocols to deliver close-to-market end-products, including swift, portable tools for field testing. Cooperation among stakeholders is encouraged to ensure the use of generic technologies for a broader spectrum of organisms. There should be liaison with EU and international reference and standardisation bodies. As regards livestock, proposals should contribute as appropriate to the objectives of the STAR-IDAZ[1] international research consortium (see SFS-12-2016). Projects should take due account of dissemination to relevant stakeholders to facilitate the uptake of results.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Individual proposals should focus on either plants or animals. Funding will allow for support for at least one project relating to plants and one to animals.
Expected Impact:
Projects outputs will result in:
validated protocols for the detection and quantification of pathogens and correlates of infection/immunity;
support for plant and animal health policies in the form of validated protocols to be used by competent authorities and reference laboratories;
the bringing to the market of end-products, such as swift, portable tools for field-testing by veterinarians, practitioners and business operators.

Genetics is currently one of the important levers for efficient livestock production, not only to increase performance and productivity, but also to ensure resilience and to reduce resource use and environmental impact, to ensure health and welfare of the animals, while maintaining or improving longevity of animals and product quality. Understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning traits, including epigenetic responses to the environment and non-genetic inheritance, remains relatively limited and underexploited, notably when several complex traits need to be targeted simultaneously, while avoiding or reducing trade-offs. In addition, improving livestock breeding programmes in both cosmopolitan and local breeds requires an optimal level of genetic diversity that needs to be measured and exploited. There is a need also for new knowledge and tools to open up new prospects for the measurement, conservation and exploitation of genetic diversity in farm animal species, for optimal genetic diversity in farm animal breeding programmes in both cosmopolitan and local breeds and to inform and develop strategies to provide for cost-effective in vivo conservation of endangered genetic resources.
Scope:
The selected projects will assist in the exploitation of existing knowledge on the genome sequence and its regulation and expression. They will do so by providing (i) analysis of the genome and the epigenome in relation to combinations of traits (including intermediate and/or indicators) important for efficient terrestrial livestock production and (ii) tools to improve breeding schemes, both for cosmopolitan and local breeds of terrestrial livestock, striving to ensure optimal genetic and epigenetic diversity, at least within breeds. The projects will encompass development of methods, tools and models to assist both industry and policy makers as well as to respond to social challenges. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[1], involving representatives of breeders, biodiversity conservation and other relevant professionals from animal production, the food chain and decision-makers, as appropriate.
The activities may address:
Study of the genetic relationship between animal performance traits to tackle some potential trade-offs between different phenotypes of interest that may alter long-term selection strategies to improve lifetime efficiency.
Assessment of the relevance of (i) epigenetic mechanisms as a potential source of phenotypic variance unaccounted by genomic selection, and (ii) improving genomic prediction models with better integration of environmental and non-genetic inheritance factors.
Development of (i) appropriate deep phenotype indicators and their genomic and epigenomic determination that reflect different ways of improving resource-use efficiency, health, welfare, quality and resilience of terrestrial livestock and (ii) multi-trait genomic and epigenomic prediction models that can efficiently utilize these indicators.
Assessment of the potential, including benefits and risks, of both (i) genome editing for cross-species and/or inter-breed transmission of specific traits without affecting other selected characteristics or specificities and (ii) targeted epigenome editing for improved animal welfare and/or product quality.
Study of the opportunity and feasibility of integration of genome editing in genomic selection (specifics and comparison with introgression: theoretical and practical applications).
Development of refined genomic and epigenomic strategies for management of biodiversity.
The projects are encouraged to interact as appropriate with relevant Horizon 2020 projects.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Methods for biology-driven selection of livestock with more balanced performances for production, robustness, and/or quality, taking into account environmental variability.
Set of phenotypes as well as the molecular tools available to farmers and farm advisers to assess and simultaneously drive animal traits related to efficiency, for a long-time evaluation of breeding strategies.
Set of options for conservation of genetic diversity among and within breeds.
More generally, the projects will contribute to the diversity and sustainability of livestock production.

","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
Disease emergence and spread are the result of a number of factors linked to the infectious agent, the host, possible vectors and the environment. The virulence of the pathogen and immunological status and genetics of the host(s) are critical in determining whether the infection develops, remains, spreads or disappears and whether the animal circumvents the disease, becomes sick or a carrier, or recovers. Establishing the biological interplay between pathogen, vectors and host(s), possibly involving other microbiota and reservoir species, is key to understanding the dynamics of infections/diseases and developing control and prevention strategies. There is a growing body of evidence on the capacity of infectious agents to evolve and circumvent the host immunological reaction or treatments and profit from environmental niches; this represents a real challenge. Although modern tools facilitate the tracking of pathogens, a lot still needs to be done to extend our knowledge of the host reaction and how we can use this to develop control and prevention strategies, in particular vaccines or diagnostics, and take the related opportunity to increase the biosecurity status of livestock, which is important both for sustainable production and safe trade.
Scope:
The research will improve knowledge of the pathogen-host-environment/possible vectors triangle and their interaction in the spread of major diseases affecting terrestrial livestock. It will contribute to understanding of the dynamics of the disease and the development of more effective control strategies, vaccines or other compounds increasing the host's natural defence/immunity and diagnostics.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The agri-food sector[1] is subject to multiple external pressures, such as rising demand for food, competition for land and other natural resources with other biomass uses, globalisation, threats from animal or plant diseases, environmental and climatic changes and public health considerations. Climate change will further impact the agri-food sector both directly through its effect on production at EU level, but also indirectly through its supply chain. This implies the need to become more efficient and sustainable; improve its impact on consumer health; take advantage of new technological developments; and become more transparent and responsive to consumer demands, within a food-system approach.
Scope:
Proposals should address one or more of the following sub-topics (A) to (C) and should clearly indicate to which one they refer.
A. [2019] ICT-enabled agri-food systems
Today, despite increased information demand from consumers and food chain players alike, Europe's food businesses and farmers are slow at adopting digital technologies. This is due in part to the inherent complexities of relevant products and processes, and in part to the dynamically changing open network organisation of the food sector with its multitude of SMEs, its cultural diversity, its differences in expectations and in the ability to serve transparency needs. The agri-food sector needs to take more advantage of the potential of digital technologies. Relevant technologies may include Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data technologies, remote and localised sensing. This sub-topic will engage the agri-food community in supporting the development of solutions to remove the barriers to adoption of digital technologies, taking a multi-actor approach across different supply chains (conventional and organic) from farm to fork. These solutions will be targeted to supporting third party development of a variety of digital technologies which can take advantage of, integrate with, and complement the standardisation efforts and platform developments in other Horizon 2020, European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and regionally/nationally-funded projects. In addition, this sub-topic will support the development of new data-driven ICT platforms and solutions which derive value for multiple actors from the data collected throughout the food chain, thereby enabling new business models which will increase the affordability and adoption of such solutions, reduce the environmental footprint, increase system resilience, and empower consumers. Interregional and international cooperation will be encouraged and complementarity with other ERA-NETs will be ensured throughout the project development stages by means of active collaboration and communication. When relevant, projects should consider synergies with the Thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on Agri-food (TSSP-AF)[2] and related interregional partnerships under the Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3).
B. [2019] Climate change and food systems
Proposals under this sub-topic will aim at developing climate-resilient and sustainable value chains for food systems. In particular they will assess risks and vulnerabilities of food systems faced with climate change, including expected effects on supply chains, thereby offering low carbon footprint solutions (technological and/or non-technological) to increase resilience and sustainability. Specific focus will be put on the socio-economic impacts of climate change on different food chains, price volatility and the territorial dimension on access to accessible and nutritious foodstuffs. Complementarity with SusFood ERA-NETs will be ensured throughout the project development stages.
C. [2019] International coordination of research on infectious animal diseases
Animal health is a key element to guarantee food safety and security, by means of competitive and sustainable livestock systems. Partnerships and collaborations at the European and International levels are important for fighting infectious animal diseases, including those which are a significant threat to human health and international trade.
The ERA-Net will cover the major groups of infectious diseases of animals, including infections by viral, bacterial, protozoal, fungal pathogens, prions, parasites, and multifactorial diseases. An important focus will be put on at least African swine fever (ASF) and animal influenza.
The ERA-NET will pool and share resources and expertise between countries to further the fundamental understanding of hosts, pathogens and their interactions. Also, focus on understanding wider animal infectious disease issues e.g. systems-based studies that integrate host/pathogen studies with the epidemiology, and population dynamics of disease, pathogenesis, ecology, evolution, and transmission, resulting eventually in better prevention of disease. An important focus will be put on the role of wildlife in the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases to livestock, and on related disease surveillance and control, in order to also contribute to animal health risk assessment activities, in particular by EFSA or OIE.
In addition, consideration needs to be given to data sharing, integration and analysis to develop new tools to accelerate identification of outbreaks, enabling a rapid response and thus reducing the spreading of diseases. This should be done in coordination with existing data sharing systems (e.g. WAHIS[3] and ADNS[4] systems).
Another focus will also be on development of safe and effective vaccines, generic technology platforms for producing novel and/or improved vaccines, and rapid, accurate and easy to use in-field diagnostics technology. Vaccination strategies, including the tools to distinguish vaccinated animals from non- vaccinated ones (DIVA vaccines) should also be addressed. New and improved vaccines have been identified as an important component in strategies to reduce reliance on antimicrobials (OIE ad hoc Group on prioritisation of diseases for which vaccines could reduce antimicrobial use in animals, 2015). There is a need to investigate new methods of generating vaccines and to understand of how best to design vaccines that drive long-lasting and protective memory responses.
Projects should be complementary to other H2020 projects in the same area.
International cooperation and industry engagement in projects selected under the ERA-Net are encouraged. The projects selected should take into consideration the EU animal health regulatory framework, and follow the policies and contribute to the objectives of the STAR-IDAZ international research consortium[5]. Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries not listed in General Annex A are eligible for EU funding under this topic and may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) only for the coordination costs of additional activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 5 million for sub-topic A) and 5 million for sub-topics B) and C), respectively, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","11 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Agriculture and aquaculture are increasingly knowledge-intensive sectors that need to be supported by advances in basic science domains in tandem with translational research. This nexus between basic and applied research requires specific openings for testing ideas and their potential application in plant and animal production, both terrestrial and aquatic.
Recent developments in genomic selection have revolutionised animal breeding and resulted in significant gains in production efficiency of animals. However, our understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning traits remains limited. Most phenotypes, in particular for traits related to health, biological efficiency and robustness, are complex and a major goal of biological research is to use genome information to predict such complex outcomes.
In the area of crop production, there is a fundamental interest in deciphering the dynamic responses of plants as they (pre)adapt to local conditions or adjust their growth and development to changes in the environment within their plasticity range. These adaptive traits are all the more important as plants are sessile and therefore require effective strategies to deal with uncertainty and to tolerate rather than avoid stress. Understanding the different adaptation strategies, and the circumstances that favour one strategy over another, is vital for understanding how annual or perennial crops perform in a given environment or under changing conditions. It will also help to assess how plants may respond to future environmental changes. Food and other plant-based products are the result of plants' capacity to harvest light and convert it into chemical energy to build energy rich organic compounds and ultimately biomass. Energy efficiency is central to plant yield and robustness. The various components of the complex plant energy system as well as their interactions (in spatial and temporal terms) need to be better understood as a basis for crop improvement, crop management and adaptability of crops to changing environments.
Scope:
A. [2018]: Understanding the genome of farmed animals, its expression and translation into traits (RIA)
For the purpose of sub-topic A, the terms 'animal' and 'farm' apply to both terrestrial and aquatic animals. Research activities should generate experimental data to map out what part of farmed animal genomes are active (whether coding or regulatory), and under which circumstances, characterise the resulting phenotypes and assess how phenotypes are affected by genetic and epigenetic changes. Bioinformatic analyses should support identification of these functional and structural elements in genomes, and enable the development of tools for genotype to phenotype prediction. Work should also help to develop or extend terminologies (ontologies) to describe, represent and standardize annotation. Proposed projects should target one or more farmed animal species with high-quality genome assemblies (in particular cows, chicken, pigs, sheep, salmon and other relevant species), focussing on specific tissue panels, and address correlations between normal and abnormal situations. They may target different physiological and developmental stages and different breeds within the same species, where this brings added value to the understanding of the genotype to phenotype relationship. As regards genome annotation, the proposed projects should use FAANG[1] metadata standards and core assays and coordinate with other projects in order to minimise overlaps. The data should be submitted to relevant European biological data archives in accordance with these standards to ensure they are available to the whole community (EMBL-EBI[2]). The proposed projects should develop and test, where appropriate, innovative tools to measure related phenotypes, including intermediate phenotypes. Activities may include biomarkers and their proxies, as well as sensors, together with ways to record related phenotypes at population level (whether reference populations or not). Proposals should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under this topic.
B. [2019]: Looking behind plant adaptation (RIA)
Proposals shall advance our understanding of the ability of plants to (pre)adapt to specific – often extreme - conditions or to react to sudden changes in their environment.
They will look into the specific mechanisms (genetic, epigenetic, physiological, morphological, metabolic…) and dynamics that underlie adaptive processes of crops and how these responses are modulated by the type and severity of conditions/stresses. In studying adaptation of crops to single or multiple abiotic conditions, work shall also establish potential fitness trade-offs. Proposals are expected to improve capacities for modelling plant adaptation responses in order to better predict changes in plant performance and inform crop improvement and crop management strategies. While taking advantage of findings from (semi) model crops, work shall focus on crop plants and relevant agronomic conditions.
Proposals should foresee a task for joint activities with other projects financed under this topic.
C. [2020]: Plant energy biology (RIA)
Proposals will advance our understanding of the plant energy system in terms of elucidating specific mechanisms as well as the complex processes and interactions that determine overall energy efficiency in plants.
More specifically work will allow to better understand and determine
(some of) the various components, processes and interactions of plants’ energy system and their regulation - from energy capture to its conversion, transport, photoassimilate partitioning and use
the metabolic reactions underlying particular functions of plants’ energy system
responses of the energy system to abiotic changes (e.g. CO2 concentration, light, temperature, water, salinity)
the basis of naturally occurring variation of selected components of the energy system
the overall energy efficiency in plants at various levels: cell – whole plant – canopy (including leaf anatomy and canopy structure)
trade-offs between the efficiency of the energy system and the plant's susceptibility to or tolerance to biotic stresses
The above listed elements provide a framework for action from which proposals can choose a particular scope and approach in line with the broader objectives of the call.
While capitalising on knowledge resulting from work in model species, proposals should also work in crop species taking into account relevant agronomic conditions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million for sub-topic A, EUR 5 million for sub-topic B and EUR 5 million for sub-topic C would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Results of funded activities will help to create knowledge hubs in their respective domains and develop specific pathways to feed biological insight into agricultural (husbandry, crops) and aquaculture practices.
In the short to medium term work will:
deliver comprehensive genome annotation maps of high quality in the targeted farmed animal species/tissues (sub-topic A);
progress in understanding genotype per environment interactions and deciphering the mechanisms by which some effects induced by environment/stressors can be transmitted across generations (sub-topic A);
pave the way for subsequent use of annotated genomes to improve precision breeding in farmed animal production, by linking genome to phenotype and improving means to measure/record phenotypes (sub-topic A);
contribute to international cooperation on genome annotation (sub-topic A);
provide insight into the range of mechanisms that underpin plant responses (from single cell to whole plant) to specific and/or multiple environmental changes (sub-topic B);
deliver more accurate models for the prediction of crop adaptation in response to environmental stresses (sub-topic B);
translate knowledge on the adaptive plasticity of plants and complex genotype by phenotype interactions into crop improvement and management strategies (sub-topic B).
allow to better understand the key mechanisms, interactions and control of the various components of plants’ energy biology system as well as their inherent trade-offs at the subcellular and whole plant level (sub-topic C)
help to better assess plant responses to abiotic changes (sub-topic C)
elucidate energy related traits to feed into breeding and crop management strategies at the level of individual plants and the canopy (sub-topic C)
advance knowledge on the relationship between photoassimilate partitioning, plant growth and agronomic yield (sub-topic C)
In the long term activities will enhance the sustainability of farmed animal production (sub-scope A). They will allow making more solid assertions on how crops will respond and can possibly better adapt to changing environments, also by means of enhancing plant energy efficiency to optimise productivity of plants.

Deadline date","Scope:
This topic covers information provision and promotion programmes aiming at increasing the awareness and recognition of Union quality schemes as defined in Article 5(4)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014
The objective is to increase the awareness and recognition of the Union quality schemes:
(a) quality schemes: Protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) and optional quality terms;
(b) organic production method;
(c) the logo for quality agriculture products specific to the outermost regions of the Union.
Information and promotion programmes targeting Union quality schemes should be a key priority in the internal market since such schemes provide consumers with assurances on the quality and characteristics of the product or the production process used, achieve added value for the products concerned and enhance their market opportunities.
One of the expected results is to increase the levels of recognition of the logo associated with the Union quality schemes by the European consumers knowing that, according to special Eurobarometer (No 440), only 20% of Europeans consumers recognise the logos of products that benefit from a protected designation of origin (PDO), 17% for a protected geographical indication (PGI) and 15% for the Traditional Specialty Guaranteed, these being the main Union quality schemes. In addition, only 23% of European consumers recognise the EU logo of organic farming.
The expected ultimate impact is to enhance the competitiveness and consumption of Union agri-food products registered under a Union quality scheme, raise their profile and increase their market share."

This topic covers information provision and promotion programmes aiming at increasing the awareness and recognition of Union quality schemes as defined in Article 5(4)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014.
The objective is to increase the awareness and recognition of the Union quality schemes, namely:

(a) quality schemes: protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) and optional quality terms;
(b) organic production method;
(c) the logo for quality agricultural products specific to the outermost regions of the Union.
Information and promotion programmes targeting these Union quality schemes should be a key priority in the internal market since such schemes provide consumers with assurances on the quality and characteristics of the product or the production process used, achieve added value for the products concerned and enhance their market opportunities.
One of the expected results is to increase the levels of recognition of the logo associated with the Union quality schemes by the European consumers. According to special Eurobarometer (No 473), only 18% of European consumers recognize the logos of products that benefit from a protected designation of origin (PDO) and a protected geographical indication (PGI), and 15% for the Traditional Specialty Guaranteed, these being the main Union quality schemes. Although awareness of the organic farming logo has increased four points since 2015, still only 27% of European consumers recognize the EU logo of organic farming.
The expected ultimate impact is to enhance the competitiveness and consumption of products registered under a Union quality scheme, raise their profile and increase their market share."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Low-carbon technologies are essential for achieving the EU's climate and energy targets, such as those recently adopted by the Commission for 2030, and contribute to implementing the industrial roadmaps that various sectors are developing in the perspective of a low-carbon economy in 2050.
The EU manufacturing sector is challenged by strong global competition and ambitious EU environmental policies. Leveraging advanced manufacturing technologies and key enabling technologies through the whole value chain and promoting the adoption of such technologies within and across sectors would help to meet these twin challenges. In particular, in the context of the EU’s decarbonisation ambitions, breakthrough solutions for advanced low-carbon manufacturing and processing are important in maintaining the competitiveness of EU industries.
Scope: Under the SILC II initiative, research and innovation activities for innovative, cost-effective technologies shall be developed in order to reduce the GHG emission intensity (ratio between direct GHG emissions and output units of an activity) of manufacturing and process industries. Proposals will preferably focus on energy-intensive industries, in particular (but not only) those industries which may be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage. Targeted industries include inter alia iron and steel, non-ferrous metals such as aluminium and copper, cement, glass, pulp and paper, chemicals and ceramics.
Proposals shall focus on research and innovation for the design and development of breakthrough solutions and implementation of demonstration programmes, including in real industrial environments. The activities should run close-to-market in production plants to demonstrate the viability of breakthrough technologies in overcoming the technological as well as non-technological barriers. Proposals will address technological solutions that could have widespread applications and may combine different technologies.
 The reduction of GHG emissions should not be achieved solely through fuel switching.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
A dedicated work package should address the transferability of the developed technologies within the sector and possibly to other sectors.
Activities are intended to start at Technology Readiness Levels 4-5 and target Technology Readiness Level 6-7; and are expected to be led by industries involving research partners and technology providers.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU around EUR 5 - 10 million and with a duration of up to five years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected impact:
                Economically viable solutions and technologies allowing an ambitious reduction in specific GHG emission intensity of at least 35%, with respect to the best available techniques currently installed[2].
                The transferability of the solutions and technologies within the sector and possibly to other sectors should be assessed.
                Reducing the compliance costs of the EU ETS and making EU industry more competitive while avoiding any unwanted distortions between Member States.
                Boosting Europe's industrial leadership in advanced manufacturing and processing and fostering employment and opening new market opportunities in this field.

For sheep/goat meat programmes proposed under Topic 2, to avoid overlaps, the message shall be different than the sustainable aspect of the sheep/goat meat production (except if sheep/goat meat is associated with (an)other product(s).
The sheep/goat meat sector is a very fragile sector: sheep/goat meat consumption is declining, and is under strong competition from cheaper imports.
The objective is to highlight the sustainable aspect of sheep/goat sector which counts as the most extensive livestock production system and plays an important role in nature protection and keeping biodiversity. Small ruminants' herds graze around 80% of areas facing natural handicap in the EU and have an active role in keeping rural population and maintaining grassland and pastures. Actions shall highlight the environmental sustainability of the production, stressing its beneficial role for climate action and the environment.
Actions may for example address how the product(s) promoted and its/their production method(s) contribute to: climate change mitigation (e.g. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions) and/or adaptation; biodiversity, conservation and sustainable use (e.g. landscape, genetic resources); sustainable water management (e.g. water use efficiency, reduction of nutrients or pesticides load); sustainable soil management (e.g. erosion control; nutrient balance; prevention of acidification, salinization).They may also highlight the active role of the extensive sheep/meat breeding in keeping rural population and in maintaining grassland and/or transhumance grazing pastures.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
On the 1st of December 2019, a new European Commission entered into service for the present quinquennium 2019-2024. The new College of Commissioners, under the presidency of Ms Ursula von der Leyen, reset the Commission’s commitment to “tackling climate and environmental-related challenges that is this generation’s defining task”. The European Green Deal Communication, presented by the Commission in December 2019, is a new growth strategy that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.
Within the most pertinent lines for the RFCS research programme arising from the European Green Deal Communication, applicants to RFCS-2020 call for the coal topic should consider the following elements when preparing their proposals:
- A power sector must be developed that is based largely on renewable sources, complemented by the rapid phasing out of coal
- The EU should also reinforce current initiatives [..] on cross-cutting climate and environment issues. This may include ending global fossil fuel subsidies in line with G20 commitments, [..] phasing out all new coal plant construction, and action to reduce methane emissions
- Focus on the regions and sectors that are most affected by the transition because they depend on fossil fuels or carbon-intensive processes
- Protect the citizens and workers most vulnerable to the transition, providing access to re-skilling programmes, jobs in new economic sectors
Scope:
Proposals submitted to the RFCS programme on the coal research topic must address at least one of the respective RFCS Research Objectives of the Council Decision 2008/376/EC (Articles 4 to 7) and should relate to the European Green Deal Communication’s elements listed in the Introduction chapter of the RFCS 2020 Information Package.
When filling in the proposal, applicants are asked to indicate which research objectives are addressed and which of the European Green Deal Communication’s elements the proposal relates to.
Each proposal shall include an assessment of anticipated industrial, economic, social and environmental benefits, as stated in the Article 26 of the Council Decision 2008/376/EC “Content of proposals”."

Research and technological development constitute a very important means of supporting European energy objectives with regard to the supply of European coal and its competitive and environmentally friendly conversion and utilisation. Moreover, the growing international dimension of the coal market and the global scale of the problems confronting it means that the European Union has to take a leading role in meeting challenges relating to modern techniques, mine safety and environmental protection at worldwide level by ensuring the transfer of know-how required for further technological progress, improved working conditions (health and safety) and enhanced environmental protection.
Scope:
Proposals submitted under this topic must relate to one of the following research objectives (see Art 4 to 7 of Council Decision 2008/376/EC).
1. Improving the competitive position of Community coal
This objective aims at reducing the total costs of mining production, improving the quality of the products and reducing the costs of using coal. This may relate to any phase in the coal production chain:
modern techniques for surveying deposits;
behaviour and control of deposits in relation to rock pressure, gas emissions, the risk of explosion, ventilation and all other factors affecting mining operations;
integrated mine planning;
highly efficient, largely automated excavation and new and existing mining technologies corresponding to the geological characteristics of European hard coal deposits;
appropriate support technologies;
transport systems;
power supply services, communication and information, transmission, monitoring and process control systems;
coal preparation techniques, oriented to the needs of the consumer markets;
coal conversion;
coal combustion.
2. Health and safety in mines
This objectives covers issues concerning mine safety, including gas control, ventilation and air-conditioning with a view to improving underground working conditions and occupational health and safety as well as environmental issues.
3. Efficient protection of the environment and improvement of the use of coal as a clean energy source
This objective aims at minimising the impact of mining operations and the use of coal in the European Union on the atmosphere, water and the surface within the framework of an integrated management strategy with respect to pollution. As the European coal industry is undergoing constant restructuring, the research shall also be geared towards minimising the environmental impact of underground mines destined for closure. This includes:
(a) a reduction in emissions from coal utilisation, including capture and storage of CO2,
(b) a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in particular methane, from coal deposits;
(c) the return to the mine of mining waste, fly ash and desulphurisation products, accompanied, where relevant, by other forms of waste;
(d) the refurbishment of waste heaps and the industrial use of residues from coal production and consumption;
(e) the protection of water tables and the purification of mine drainage water;
(f) a reduction in the environmental impact of installations which mainly use EU coal and lignite;
(g) the protection of surface installations against the effects of subsidence in the short and long term.
4. Management of external dependence on energy supply
The objective covers prospects for long-term energy supply and concerns the upgrading, in economic, energy-related and environmental terms, of coal deposits which cannot be extracted economically by conventional mining techniques. Projects may include studies, the definition of strategies, fundamental and applied research and the testing of innovative techniques which offer prospects for the upgrading of EU coal resources. This includes the integration of complementary techniques such as the adsorption of methane or carbon dioxide, coal bed methane extraction and underground coal gasification."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research and technological development constitute a very important means of supporting European energy objectives with regard to the supply of European coal and its competitive and environmentally friendly conversion and utilisation. Moreover, the growing international dimension of the coal market and the global scale of the problems confronting it means that the European Union has to take a leading role in meeting challenges relating to modern techniques, mine safety and environmental protection at worldwide level by ensuring the transfer of know-how required for further technological progress, improved working conditions (health and safety) and enhanced environmental protection.
Scope:
Proposals submitted under this topic must relate to one of the following research objectives (see Art 4 to 7 of Council Decision 2008/376/EC).
1. Improving the competitive position of Community coal
This objective aims at reducing the total costs of mining production, improving the quality of the products and reducing the costs of using coal. This may relate to any phase in the coal production chain:
modern techniques for surveying deposits;
behaviour and control of deposits in relation to rock pressure, gas emissions, the risk of explosion, ventilation and all other factors affecting mining operations;
integrated mine planning;
highly efficient, largely automated excavation and new and existing mining technologies corresponding to the geological characteristics of European hard coal deposits;
appropriate support technologies;
transport systems;
power supply services, communication and information, transmission, monitoring and process control systems;
coal preparation techniques, oriented to the needs of the consumer markets;
coal conversion;
coal combustion.
2. Health and safety in mines
This objectives covers issues concerning mine safety, including gas control, ventilation and air-conditioning with a view to improving underground working conditions and occupational health and safety as well as environmental issues.
3. Efficient protection of the environment and improvement of the use of coal as a clean energy source
This objective aims at minimising the impact of mining operations and the use of coal in the European Union on the atmosphere, water and the surface within the framework of an integrated management strategy with respect to pollution. As the European coal industry is undergoing constant restructuring, the research shall also be geared towards minimising the environmental impact of underground mines destined for closure. This includes:
(a) a reduction in emissions from coal utilisation, including capture and storage of CO2,
(b) a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in particular methane, from coal deposits;
(c) the return to the mine of mining waste, fly ash and desulphurisation products, accompanied, where relevant, by other forms of waste;
(d) the refurbishment of waste heaps and the industrial use of residues from coal production and consumption;
(e) the protection of water tables and the purification of mine drainage water;
(f) a reduction in the environmental impact of installations which mainly use EU coal and lignite;
(g) the protection of surface installations against the effects of subsidence in the short and long term.
4. Management of external dependence on energy supply
The objective covers prospects for long-term energy supply and concerns the upgrading, in economic, energy-related and environmental terms, of coal deposits which cannot be extracted economically by conventional mining techniques. Projects may include studies, the definition of strategies, fundamental and applied research and the testing of innovative techniques which offer prospects for the upgrading of EU coal resources. This includes the integration of complementary techniques such as the adsorption of methane or carbon dioxide, coal bed methane extraction and underground coal gasification."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The operation of potentially large numbers of drones at low levels, mostly outside airspace where there is any formal ATC, presents a number of significant operational challenges. For this reason, it is necessary to establish a clear concept of operations that is understood and agreed by all stakeholders. The research will include identification of how drones can be operated safely in non-nominal situations, without posing an unacceptable danger to other airspace users, or people and property on the ground.
As with any disruptive technology or concept, the reaction from society will vary enormously depending on the perspective of the individual or organisation. Furthermore, the fundamental rights of European citizens must be protected from intrusion by drone operators. Consequently, this project will also examine non-aviation aspects of drone operations, to identify key issues for society and to offer solutions to ease social acceptance.
Scope:
In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 1) topics a) to d).
This project addresses those drones that are expected to operate in the VLL environment, covering many types of aerial activity, including leisure, remote infrastructure inspection, rural operations, flights in densely-populated and urban areas, and flights near protected sites, such as airports or nuclear power stations. Although manned aviation operating in this airspace is typically uncontrolled, it will be necessary to address how drones might operate within controlled airspace near, for example, airfields. In addition, VLL airspace is also used by other classes of airspace users, such as military aircraft, rotorcraft, balloons, hang-gliders, micro-lights, parachutists and so on. The Concept must enable safe interaction with all these users. Operational considerations must include contingencies and emergencies, and societal issues must also be addressed.
This topic is not intended to address particular technological solutions, which are covered in ‘WA-2: Technical Issues’ in this Call. However, it will be necessary for the project to identify where technical developments are needed, and to quantify, as far as possible, the high-level safety and performance requirements of that technology needed to implement the Concept. The project should not propose specific technology choices.
Since the Operational Concept is the foundation upon which additional drone research work will be conducted, the project will produce of a set of reference scenarios that illustrate the wide variety of drone operations that could be anticipated.
The development of the concept of operations should take into account work already undertaken around the world on this subject in order to promote relevant global harmonisation, in particular NASA’s Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) research project, and work being undertaken by JARUS. The project should make clear any assumptions made about the volumes of traffic used to define the concept and any implications for its viability if those assumptions are inaccurate.
Expected Impact:
The generation of a successful and accepted concept of operations for the operation of drones is a prerequisite for the development of standards, regulations, management and control agencies, operating procedures and business plans. It will also provide the foundation upon which technical and infrastructure developments can be made in order to allow the drone market to achieve its full potential.

In manned aviation, the sharing of timely and relevant information, of guaranteed quality, is recognised as a prerequisite for safe and efficient operations. Drones will operate in complex low-level airspace where there will be other drones, manned aircraft, buildings and terrain hazards. It is essential, therefore, that aeronautical information and planning facilities are sufficiently robust and accurate to enable these operations to be conducted safely and efficiently.
Scope:
In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic a).
It is anticipated that information management will be as applicable to drone operations as it is to manned aviation, but it is not clear if the type of data currently available to manned aviation, and the way it is managed and accessed, is appropriate to drone operations. This should be investigated. Furthermore, the cost implications should be considered against the potentially more financially-constrained nature of many forms of drone operation.
The range of drones under consideration is very large, ranging from small line-of-sight (LOS) drones of limited capability, all the way up to extremely advanced machines flying autonomously over long distances in a wide variety of airspace environments. Consequently, this topic should consider information management from the perspective of the many mission types that may be envisaged. A scenario-based approach may be considered to illustrate the range and applicability of information management.
A project proposing to cover this topic should make clear any assumptions made about the volumes of traffic used in the analysis and any implications for the conclusions.
Expected Impact:
There is likely to be a vast amount of information generated by the appearance of large numbers of drones in the skies. Unless drone operations are supported by an appropriate information-management environment, it is unlikely that safe and effective drone operations could be conducted. This study will identify drone-specific issues concerning information management, the need for integration with manned aviation, and explore solutions to the issues raised. In doing this, a safe increase in drone activity will be supported, and growth of the industry promoted.

The operation of drones in VLL airspace introduces new challenges not encountered by manned aviation. Typically, outside the vicinity of airfields, there is limited infrastructure to support aerial operations, such as communication and surveillance. Furthermore, conventional navigation infrastructure may not be able to support the needs of VLL operations. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the concept of operations for VLL drone operations and to specify the ground-based technologies that are required to enable that concept.
Scope:
In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic d) and e).
This project should examine what ground-based technologies are needed to support UTM, describe its technical architecture and indicate its performance requirements. It should address the use of communications, navigation and surveillance technologies, and how data supplied by these means should be used and by whom, including the need for traffic situation and other displays. The complications posed by the operation of drones beyond line of sight should be addressed.
The specification of data links is not in the scope of this topic, and nor are issues related to the performance of networks needed to support them, or spectrum issues for any technologies considered in the concept for any purpose
Expected Impact:
It is certain that the new concept of VLL operations by drones will need both new technologies and the re-use of existing technologies in order to function safely and efficiently. Correct specification of this technology will significantly facilitate the effective implementation of drone operations.

Most drones, even autonomous ones, will need some form of data link. This could be for command and control, payload, collision avoidance, communication with the UTM system etc. Many technologies exist for data link from within and without the aviation world and it is necessary to identify which technologies are suitable for use to enable safe and efficient drone operations. Each technology places demands on both supporting networks and the electromagnetic spectrum. Given the potential volume of drones that may be operating, it is critical to understand the ability of scarce spectrum resources to support such datalink requirements, and to ensure that drone operations using these technologies do not adversely interfere with manned aviation.
Scope:
In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic b).
This topic covers all issues concerning use of data link for drones. It should explore technological solutions, their limitations, their relevance and their performance requirements, including usage of spectrum. However, any data links concerned with drone payload operations are not in scope of this project, unless they are dual-use. In that case, the safety, redundancy and performance issues associated with dual-use technology should be addressed. The topic should also cover the network issues associated with the use of drone data links, including options for implementing a suitable network or networks, such as use of mobile telecommunications networks.
It is likely that drones of different classes will have very different requirements. A range of drone types should be examined, and a scenario-based approach may be considered.
Expected Impact:
Data links are an essential component of drone operation. The wide variety of drones entering service, and the wide range of missions for which they are likely to be used, means that it is vital to ensure that data links used are safe, effective, meet appropriate performance requirements and do not adversely affect that spectrum protected for use by aviation stakeholders. It is essential to understand these issues and ensure that they are well controlled in order for drones to be safely integrated with manned aviation.

The operation of drones represents a new challenge to society in that, for the first time, airborne assets will be available to anyone to fly, yet which have the capability to invade privacy or to cause distress and damage to people and property. It is essential, therefore, to ensure that the risk to the public is minimised by effective regulation, supported by appropriate technologies. Furthermore, it is essential that the potential for drones to fly where they are not supposed to is minimised as far as possible.
Scope:
In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic a) with regards to geofencing and f).
This topic covers security from three perspectives:
Security of the drone system;
Security of third parties as a result of the operation of a drone system; and
Application of geo-fencing to ensure compliance with mission and airspace constraints.
A project proposing to cover this topic should investigate how to protect the drone system itself to ensure that, not only can it be prevented from performing outside its intended manner through some unexpected interference, for example, but also that the drone could not be unlawfully interfered with in order to deliberately divert it from its intended mission.
Drones have the potential to execute illegal and dangerous activities including, for example, acts of terror. This project will look at ways of reducing the risk of such unlawful interference.
A project proposing to cover this focus should also examine the concept of geo-fencing. This includes examining the UTM concept developed in Work Area 1, including concepts for airspace classification and reservation, and examine options for ensuring that airspace constraints cannot be violated.
This topic covers technological options for both airborne and ground elements, including navigation, communication between air and ground, in-flight updates, network requirements, service provision options etc.
Expected Impact:
There is considerable concern about the security implications of the proliferation of drone operations. This project will analyse the problem so that security issues can be effectively addressed as drone operations are enabled. Geo-fencing can be used advantageously to allow or deny any action of a drone, depending on its position. Successful deployment of such systems should increase safety and prevent unlawful activity by drone operators.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
It is expected that, by 2035, our skies will go through a profound change. Where currently airspace is sparsely occupied by larger aircraft at higher altitudes and by small leisure and commercial aircraft closer to the ground, the rise of commercial & civil drone usage would lead to a much denser form of air traffic at VLL, with many more interactions between air traffic participants. This poses a considerable challenge from a traffic management point of view.
The challenge is to find a robust and interoperable technical solution that is suitable for the smallest of drones. Importantly, many of these drones are envisaged to operate autonomously. The solution will have to be lightweight, energy efficient, and allow for autonomous avoidance manoeuvres even on the smallest of drones.
Scope:
In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topics a) to e) for long term aspects.
This project will answer the question: “How can drones best leverage a sensor suite of state-of-the-art electronic sensors and communication devices in order to make a safe, robust and interoperable VLL UTM solution for e.g. detect-and-avoid that still fits on small drones?”
The mobile phone industry has spurred an unprecedented advance in the production of small electronics, which has resulted in a plethora of sensors, processors, and communication devices, including small cameras, tiny radars, structured light sensors, microphones, and small communication devices. It is possible that, by combining these sensors in the best way possible, a common solution to VLL UTM could be found.
For full robustness, the solution should involve both collaborative conflict resolution and, for where collaborative systems fail or are not present, non-collaborative conflict resolution. For non-collaborative conflict resolution, multiple sensors should be investigated and combined in a single, lightweight sensor and navigation package, in which sensor data-fusion leads to high robustness. It should also be investigated how this solution would perform in densely-populated areas, with drones flying in an urban environment or even indoors. Also, it will have to be investigated how the interaction should be shaped with a potentially very connected ‘Internet of Things’ environment.
The topic should research sensor selection, data fusion and supporting procedures to fully describe the proposed solution.
Expected Impact:
There is expected to be a significant rise in the number of small drones operating in the VLL environment, which is largely uncontrolled but still used by manned aviation. Implementation of a sensor suite able to be carried by small drones and capable of avoiding other drones, manned aircraft and other obstacles would significantly assist the growth of the small-drone sector and enable its safe operation in all classes of airspace.

VLL drones represent a new type of air vehicle that operate in a fundamentally different way to conventional aviation. In order to remain safe and effective, they will require new technologies to be developed and installed on the air vehicle itself, or for existing technologies to be used in a different way, both of which should be safely interoperable with existing manned aviation.
Scope:
In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic d).
This topic covers technologies that will need to be fitted to drones in order to implement the concept of operations for VLL drones. It is recommended that the project proposing to cover this topic works closely with Topic 1 in order to promote a coherent approach to addressing the problem. Since there are likely to be a wide variety of drone types, operating in different ways, the project should consider not just individual technologies, but how such technologies should interoperate with other drones and manned aviation, especially when large numbers of drones are deployed. The impact on spectrum should also be considered where applicable.
This Topic should address all aspects of airborne technology, including Communications, Navigation and Surveillance systems, Detect and Avoid systems, auto-pilot systems (including for autonomous operations). The Topic should include coverage of the miniaturisation of drone technologies and what could be done to produce lower-cost systems than are currently in use in manned aviation, including the use of non-certified systems.
Expected Impact:
There is a wide variety of drone types varying from those small ‘toy-like’ machines with limited capability, all the way up to highly-advanced systems with performance very similar to manned aircraft. Consequently, the range of technologies needed to enable all anticipated variations in drone operations is vast. This project is expected to explore a comprehensive range of options for airborne technology across the full range of drone operations, enabling the growth of the sector and the safe integration of drones with other drones and with manned aviation.

Despite the continued funding of scientific projects, innovative ideas and methods from practice are not captured and spread, while also often research findings are not integrated into agricultural and forestry practice. It is essential to act at EU level to remedy this because national and sectoral agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKISs) are insufficiently connected and organised to fully facilitate the necessary intensifying of thematic cooperation between researchers, advisors and farmers/foresters. This exchange of knowledge will foster economically viable and sustainable agriculture and forestry.
Scope:
The themes must focus on the most urgent needs which farmers and foresters experience. The activities of thematic networks are summarising, sharing and presenting, - in a language that is easy to understand and is targeted to farmers and foresters - existing best practices and research findings that are close to being put into practice, but not sufficiently known or used by practitioners. The specific themes of the networks can be chosen in a 'bottom-up' way. First and foremost, they must tackle the most urgent needs experienced by farmers and foresters. If it is appropriate to solve these needs, the themes can cover sectoral or cross-sectoral issues, organisational or management solutions. The activities should pay attention to the cost/benefit aspects of the specific practices collected and summarised. A comprehensive description of the state of current farming practices relative to the chosen theme should explain the added value of the proposal and the relevance of the theme for the farmer. The proposal should also explain how it avoids duplication with ongoing or completed projects and networks. In order to better reach and capture knowledge from the targeted farmers/foresters, the networks may organise 'cross-fertilisation' through sub-networks covering, for example, a region, a language or a production system.
The result of the project should be an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing end-user material for farmers and foresters. This information should be easy to access and understand, and feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by farmers and foresters at national or regional level. It should also be provided to the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' in the common ""practice abstract"" format. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1], with preferably a project duration of three years and a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge clearly activating farmers/foresters, farmers' groups and advisors. Wherever possible, details on the synergies with relevant EIP Operational Groups and interactive innovation groups operating in the context of the EIP-AGRI are expected, and, if useful, with other European Structural and Investment Fund projects. In the exceptional event that minor testing of specific solutions would be needed, a maximum of 20% of the project budget may be used for this purpose.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Despite the continued funding of scientific projects, innovative ideas and methods from practice are not captured and spread, while also often research findings are not integrated into agricultural and forestry practice. It is essential to act at EU level to remedy this because national and sectoral agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKISs) are insufficiently connected and organised to fully facilitate the necessary intensifying of thematic cooperation between researchers, advisors and farmers/foresters. This exchange of knowledge will foster economically viable and sustainable agriculture and forestry.
Scope:
The themes must focus on the most urgent needs which farmers and foresters experience. The activities of thematic networks are summarising, sharing and presenting, - in a language that is easy to understand and is targeted to farmers and foresters - existing best practices and research findings that are close to being put into practice, but not sufficiently known or used by practitioners. The specific themes of the networks can be chosen in a 'bottom-up' way. First and foremost, they must tackle the most urgent needs experienced by farmers and foresters. If it is appropriate to solve these needs, the themes can cover sectoral or cross-sectoral issues, organisational or management solutions. The activities should pay attention to the cost/benefit aspects of the specific practices collected and summarised. A comprehensive description of the state of current farming practices relative to the chosen theme should explain the added value of the proposal and the relevance of the theme for the farmer. The proposal should also explain how it avoids duplication with ongoing or completed projects and networks. In order to better reach and capture knowledge from the targeted farmers/foresters, the networks may organise 'cross-fertilisation' through sub-networks covering, for example, a region, a language or a production system.
The result of the project should be an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing end-user material for farmers and foresters. This information should be easy to access and understand, and feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by farmers and foresters at national or regional level. It should also be provided to the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' in the common ""practice abstract"" format. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1], with preferably a project duration of three years and a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge clearly activating farmers/foresters, farmers' groups and advisors. Wherever possible, details on the synergies with relevant EIP Operational Groups and interactive innovation groups operating in the context of the EIP-AGRI are expected, and, if useful, with other European Structural and Investment Fund projects. In the exceptional event that minor testing of specific solutions would be needed, a maximum of 20% of the project budget may be used for this purpose.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million per project would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities must
contribute to the collection and distribution of easily accessible practice-oriented knowledge on the thematic area chosen, including delivering as many “practice abstracts” in the common EIP-AGRI format as possible and as much audio-visual material as possible.
conserve the practical knowledge for the long term - beyond the project period – in particular by using the main trusted dissemination channels which farmers/foresters consult most often, and also serve education and training purposes;
increase the flow of practical information between farmers/foresters in Europe in a geographically balanced way, creating spill-overs and taking account of the differences between territories;
achieve greater user acceptance of collected solutions and a more intensive dissemination of existing knowledge.

","22 October 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The main objective of the prize is to develop an innovative solution that will allow tracking all commercial freight trains[1], from all railway undertakings, covering the whole European network. The aim is to provide real time information about the train, accessible to all, including information on the location, departure, destination, compositition and punctuality. The desired solution must take into account the national messages compliant with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1305/2014 of 11 December 2014[1] on the technical specification for interoperability relating to the telematics applications for freight subsystem of the rail system in the European Union and repealing the Regulation (EC) No 62/2006 (hereinafter TAF-TSI) and the existing interfaces with multimodal hubs (terminal, ports authorities, etc).
In particular, the single solution (interface,tools,etc.) will ensure
a seamless tracking (possibly from path request until operation) of commercial trains across Europe in Infrastructure Managers networks and beyond, in synergy with “Telematics Applications for Freight services” (hereinafter TAF) compatible messages and existing online tools.
a service to track commercial trains across Europe, including tailormade access to data within TAF environment Railway Undertakings(RU), Infrastructure Managers (IM), TIS (Train Information System from Rail Net Europe (RNE)), terminals, port authorities and combined transports operators, etc. adaptable to the needs of different users.
Further information can be found in the Rule of Contest.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that a single solution for the implementation of efficient methods and tools to track commercial trains, across IM networks and Terminals, in synergy with the TRAIN ID and train data-related activities managed by the Joint Sector Group Rail Net Europe (RNE), and Forum Train Europe taking stock of the Telematics Application for Freight TSI (TAF TSI) for mainstreaming, will be the final result of the prize.
The solution should demonstrate its technical validity and universality while at the same time it should provide a viable path (of measures and advantages) to go beyond the current state of play and open to further developments of the single Train ID.

","31 July 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The general objective of the pilot project is to contribute to assessing the benefits of a broadband connectivity via satellite in areas impacted by digital divide with the support of regional or national public authorities, as a precursor of the even larger benefits that the European Gigabit Society will later make largely available.
In accordance with this objective, the entities allowed to participate in the call must have a clear experience in implementing space telecommunications technologies for the reduction of the digital divide and for connectivity improvement.
Accordingly, proposals shall help the Commission to achieve at least the following specific objectives:
Analysis of EU regions in long-term digital divide and impacted sectors and population notably for schools: the identification of some relevant regions, schools and other stakeholders must be in the proposals;
Assessment of simple, efficient and cost-effective implementation schemes (e.g. vouchers) to ensure easy access to satellite broadband connectivity: the proposals must present solutions ensuring easy access to satellite broadband connectivity;
Assessment, through deployment of broadband internet access via satellite to some unconnected schools (“field trials”), of the benefit of distribution via satellite of educational multimedia content relying, to the extent possible, on data and services offered by the Union space programmes; and
Development of outreach and communication activities.
Proposals shall describe how relevant European stakeholders in the ICT supply chain shall be involved through an inclusive process and which appropriate coordination with educational stakeholders (Ministries of Education, EU Commission, etc.) shall be established.
Applicants may find useful data and information for the preparation of their proposal by contacting NEREUS – Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies. As NEREUS is the unique European regions’ association spreading the use and understanding of space technologies, it could provide support to the pilot project while taking care of involving regions currently not members of NEREUS.
Within the limited scope of a pilot project, the overall expected outcomes of the pilot project are:
The assessment of the benefits of a broadband connectivity via satellite for a minimum of 10 schools across Europe in minimum of 3 different and a maximum of 5 different Member States and;
The assessment of other market sectors and identification of the related stakeholders that could potentially benefit from broadband connectivity via satellite in regions affected by digital divide.
The proposals shall take into consideration, in order to avoid any overlapping and exploit possible synergies, any other existing or planned initiatives (European, national, regional...) which are likely to meet the need of broadband connectivity improvement of the schools chosen to be connected."

","Research and Innovation action
","26 July 2018
","16 April 2019","Specific Challenge:
Many complex disorders pose a challenge to identify the most effective therapeutic interventions because current therapies often target specific aspects of a disease, without achieving complete control or the best possible results for patients. Due to the multiple causes of such diseases and the heterogeneity between patients, approaches directed at single targets have had limited efficacy, overlooking important factors involved in disease pathophysiology. Hence, a promising therapeutic approach to meet this challenge is to combine different therapies, while increasing therapeutic efficacy in a cost-effective manner.
Scope:
Research should aim to understand at systems level the pathophysiology of a disorder in groups of patients responding well or poorly to particular therapies and further develop combinatorial therapies tailored to the needs of individuals or stratified patient groups.
Projects should focus on already available and/or authorised therapies and have access to standardized biobank samples derived from retrospective or currently running clinical studies. These patient samples should be re-analysed with modern high-throughput technologies. The existing and newly produced data should be integrated using systems approaches, which could combine sub-cellular/cellular and/or organ level in-silico models and network analysis as appropriate, and used to build more sophisticated computational frameworks to predict patient responses to combinatorial therapies. These predictions should be validated in pre-clinical and clinical studies[1] taking into account sex and gender differences. Funding of late stage clinical trials is not within the scope of this topic.
Applicants should include a thorough data management plan for transnational data sharing to enable the computational analysis and it is strongly recommended to adhere to the state-of-the-art international standards and to the general concepts of the FAIR[2] principles.
The topic invites proposals in complex disorders of high prevalence and of a high economic burden (rare diseases are excluded). SME participation is strongly encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
New concepts of combinatorial therapies for complex disorders tailored to the needs of individuals or stratified patient groups.
Improved efficacy and take-up in the clinical setting in comparison to established therapeutic interventions.
Enable the development of personalised medicine.
Increased research & innovation opportunities in this industry intensive field, particularly for SMEs.

","Research and Innovation action
","07 November 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The human microbiome plays an important role for health. Many different projects in 'metagenomics' and epidemiological research in recent years have delivered new knowledge on associations between the microbiome and a wide range of diseases. International initiatives such as the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC) have generated large-scale data. These research efforts were first of all made to identify host-microbe-interactions and links of the microbiome with diseases. Now the challenge is to accelerate the translation of data and knowledge to define balanced healthy conditions and to predict and prevent diseases through the development of personalised approaches and clinical tools. Building on existing data it is necessary to produce also new data with the aim to make the research more comprehensive or more holistic and to achieve more valuable clinical tools. Whilst the promise of such tools is evident, they need to be validated and be part of personalised medicine.
This topic will focus on the clinical aspects of personalised prediction and prevention of disease. Other aspects of microbiome research in relation to food/nutrition will be addressed by a cluster of topics in Societal Challenge 2. Further topics may be launched under the IMI2 JU.
Scope:
The aim is to achieve understanding of balanced states of health and on that basis to deliver personalised approaches and clinical tools for predicting and preventing diseases. Proposals should integrate and use high quality microbiome, metabolome and other -omics data produced by large scale international initiatives. They should combine and expand these data with approaches including disease-oriented functional analysis, endogenous and exogenous factors, innovative imaging, functional, structural and lifestyle, ageing, dietary data, environmental data, mental disorders and/or any other comorbidity.
Proposals should build on data from existing microbiome projects and, as appropriate, on data from other international initiatives. Focussed production of new data should make subject coverage more comprehensive with the aim of delivering more valuable clinical tools. Proposals should address relevant ethical implications, take into account sex and gender differences, the effect of country-specific issues and should include a section on research data management. The proposed work should be connected to the future European Open Science Cloud[1] to enable sharing and re-use of resources as well as interoperability with other types of data and tools across disciplines. Proposals should contribute to standardisation of sample collection and storage, methods (Standard Operating Procedures) and study designs. SMEs participation is encouraged.
Proposals addressing rare diseases are not in scope of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Personalised medicine approaches for the prediction and prevention of diseases through exploitation, integration and combination of data from existing microbiome projects and appropriate other international -omics studies.
More valuable clinical tools built on existing data and new complementary data in relevant repositories.
Identification and validation of microbial functionalities; robust healthy conditions and determinants of resilience for defined populations at specific body sites.
Better prediction and prevention of diseases through validated novel clinical tools that are helpful for end-users.
More intensive collaboration and strategic synergies between scientists across disciplines and sectors.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Advanced therapies are based on gene, cell or tissue-engineered products which are defined according to the terms of Regulation 1394/2007. So far, only a small number of these products have been placed on the market, and of these, most are for rare diseases. However, in recent years, important discoveries and developments, some unprecedented, have been made in molecular and cell biology and in cell technology, which offer improved opportunities for advanced therapies development. The challenge is to use the new knowledge and new technologies to introduce greater innovation into the advanced therapy development chain as a basis for tackling diseases and conditions affecting large patient groups.
Scope:
Building on European strengths and using the definition set out in Regulation (EC) 1394/2007[1], projects should create knowledge, testing and exploitation platforms around innovative concepts for advanced therapy development. Platforms should comprise the components and expertise necessary to create a solid foundation on which to build possible new therapeutic approaches and/or aim to overcome particular development bottlenecks. Possible components could include studying the basic biology of the potential therapy and investigating its mode of action, proof of concept (in vitro, in animal models – where necessary - or first-in–man studies); safety, efficacy, characterisation, refinement and manufacturing of the product could be considered. Projects should also propose a business model for exploiting results and carry out appropriate outreach and public information activities. Examples of issues that have been identified as holding back the field include gene delivery to cells, reducing off-target effects in gene therapy, immunogenicity of potential new therapies, cell homing and tracking, lack of adequate pre-clinical models, or responding to regulatory concerns, such as potency assays, product characterization, or bank-to-bank variability (non-exhaustive list for illustrative purposes only). Sex and gender differences should be investigated, where relevant. Potential ethical issues should be addressed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 12 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Strengthened competitive position of European advanced therapy research and development.
Improved perspectives for treating diseases and conditions in large patient groups with advanced therapies.

","26 July 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
We observe a progressive shift in routine diagnostics, and more particularly in personalised medicine practice, from a growing number of molecular tests to a next generation sequencing approach (NGS). NGS can provide insights on a person’s genetic susceptibility to disease, diagnostic information, and predictive indications about treatment outcome. It also allows to embrace simultaneously different molecular pathways of disease evolution and to identify actionable mutations in a patient for medical decision and further research. In addition, it requires less sample material than multiple tests and therefore reduces risk and inconvenience for patients. However, the introduction of NGS in clinical practice is hampered by its cost, the availability of proper NGS tests, and diagnostic errors resulting from insufficient quality assurance, technological bias and complex interpretation of data.
Scope:
The objective is to implement NGS in routine diagnostics for personalised medicine and scale up demand-driven innovation for healthcare systems. This includes organisational, economical, technical and clinical aspects. It should lead to NGS tests, clinically validated procedures (including sex analysis), quality assurance schemes, tools and methods for data collection, management, analysis and interpretation, with a view to assist clinical decision-making and foster medical research and innovation. Transferability and cloud based NGS data analyses should be considered, as appropriate. Input from initiatives like the EJP Cofund on rare diseases and ERNs[1] should be considered when relevant. Ethical issues should be addressed.
For grants awarded under this topic for Pre-Commercial procurement it is expected that results could contribute to European or international standards. Therefore, the respective option of Article 28.2 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 9 and 11 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals of this topic should follow the specific requirements for pre-commercial procurement PCP supported by Horizon 2020 grants as set out in General Annex E of the WP.
Expected Impact:
New NGS platforms and use of NGS tests in routine diagnostics for personalised medicine.
Accepted new European standards and quality assurance schemes with respect to NGS.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The reliability and relevance of animal studies to support chemical safety assessment are subject to increasing scrutiny from a scientific perspective and raises broader societal concerns. To address these challenges, the European Commission has been supporting the development and application of animal-free approaches to toxicological profiling of chemicals in support of chemical safety assessment. However, significant challenges remain regarding the provision of viable animal-free solutions to address systemic health effects in humans potentially linked to chronic exposure to chemicals across a variety of regulated sectors. Consequently, further efforts are needed to progress on the development, validation and translation of scientifically sound methods that not only decrease the reliance on animal testing but which also deliver more relevant, reliable and cost-effective means to facilitate decision-making to support regulation, innovation and competitiveness.
Scope:
Proposals should consider integrative approaches that build on advances in all relevant fields of science and technology, including elements such as novel in vitro[1] and in silico tools and the understanding of human biology and related toxicity pathways, with the aim of proposing and demonstrating scientifically valid means for comprehensive safety assessment of chemical substances without resorting to animal testing. Priority should be on systemic health effects in humans. Exploitation of qualitative and quantitative information and knowhow from animal, clinical, epidemiological, exposure and biomonitoring studies is encouraged where appropriate to inform research strategies and to establish the scientific credibility of the approaches proposed for relevant decision-making contexts. In addition, attention should be given to establishing and pursuing concrete measures to seek acceptance and uptake by end-users striving to address safety assessment challenges in support of product development and addressing regulatory information requirements.
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) to provide add-value regarding such aspects as supporting validation of emerging approaches, promotion of research results, and the interfacing with the regulatory community. In this respect, the JRC is open to collaborate with any successful proposal after the selection process has been completed.
As a way to facilitate progress and to accelerate the harmonisation, acceptance and promotion of new approaches worldwide, applicants are encouraged to seek cooperation with industry and collaboration with any relevant complementary initiatives as well as with regulatory bodies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Scientifically sound, practicably implementable non-animal solutions readily deployable to aid in meaningful safety assessment of chemicals.
Recognition from regulatory bodies and their engagement to translate results, methods and solutions into safety assessment practice.
Uptake and commercial exploitation of the developed safety assessment approaches, products and services.

The availability of appropriate decision support tools for healthcare practitioners can promote uptake of personalised medicine in health care. There is a need to carry out research activities aiming to develop and validate such decision tools that would integrate available and/or emerging diagnostic means for the area concerned, enabling increased precision of diagnostics and clinical decision making. On-going progress in the fields of bioinformatics and biostatistics, advanced analytical tools (e.g. machine learning) up to Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, should make possible the development of devices, platforms or novel approaches leading to highly personalised diagnosis, based on the integration of data available from various sources. The ultimate result would be a detailed health status assessment from a multitude of viewpoints, in a systemic way and easy to use for clinical purposes, leading to better diagnostic accuracy, increased effectiveness and efficiency of treatments. Novel hardware enabling truly innovative, integrative diagnostic platforms can also be considered.
Scope:
Proposals should develop tools, platforms or services that will use information provided by most relevant diagnostic means for a particular area, resulting in an accurate, detailed, structured, systemic and prioritised assessment of the health status in a patient. The proposed solutions should integrate various data sources such as medical records, in vitro and/or in vivo diagnostics, medical imaging, -omics data, functional tests (lab-on-a-chip) etc., while taking into account the actual needs of healthcare practitioners, and should be tested and validated in real-life settings in pilot centres, facilitating future Health Technology Assessment. These tools/platforms/services should contribute to improving diagnosis and clinical decision, not only integrate existing data, and should involve intelligent human-computer interface solutions to facilitate its daily use in clinical practice. Any medical data relevant for a particular disease (textual data, numerical measurements, recorded signals, images etc.) may be considered. The aim is to steer the development of solutions towards concrete patient and public sector needs, having the citizen and healthcare providers at the centre. Careful attention should be paid to appropriately addressing ethical and legal concerns, providing adequate information to health professionals and patients to support informed decisions, and ensuring data safety and privacy, in line with existing European and international standards and legislation. Gender and sex differences should be taken into consideration when relevant.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting different amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increase EU's capacity to innovate in the area of medical instruments technologies through the development of new diagnostic tools, platforms or services integrating various diagnostic data and providing quick, detailed, accurate and highly personalised diagnostics for optimal decision in clinical practice.
Improve the quality and sustainability of healthcare systems through quicker and more encompassing diagnosis of medical conditions, leading to quicker and better clinical decisions and timely delivery of effective personalised treatments, with reduction of errors and delays (and costs associated to them).

Regenerative medicine offers hope for untreatable disease and the ageing population, improved quality of life and reduced medical costs. However, so far, regenerative medicine has not yet proved itself in the clinic beyond rare diseases or conditions of limited public health importance. With recent scientific discoveries opening up new approaches to regenerative medicine, the challenge is to use these to extend the regenerative approach to major diseases and conditions.
Scope:
Regenerative medicine replaces or regenerates human cells, tissue or organs, to restore or establish normal function. Projects should focus on innovative translational research to develop regenerative processes towards the ultimate clinical goal of addressing unmet clinical needs of large patient groups. Proposals should be based on new approaches such as genome editing or gene therapy, transdifferentiation or in vivo reprogramming, cell therapy and transplantation, 3D bioprinting, organoids or use of combined products (non-exhaustive list for illustrative purposes only). In all cases, proposals should explain in what way their approach is regenerative. Research on improved methods of tissue and organ transplantation is included on the condition that there is a clear regenerative step in the process. The project may focus on any step(s) on the innovation chain, from early testing and characterization of regenerative mechanisms to preclinical research, proof of concept or clinical trial.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A range of factors is responsible for the (re-)emergence of infectious disease threats, including antimicrobial resistance, altering the epidemiology and spread of disease in a changing global environment. These include drivers such as climate change and associated environmental impacts, population growth, unplanned urbanisation and high mobility, as well as animal husbandry or intensive farming practices.
At the same time, tools for infectious disease diagnostics and surveillance are evolving rapidly, allowing for ever more accurate diagnosis in ever shorter time. The use of next generation sequencing combined with surveillance data, health registries and societal data from informal/non-traditional sources (e.g. social media) holds promise for improving individual and population health. Current advanced IT technologies offer the opportunity to integrate such big data sets and could enable the rapid and personalised treatment of infected patients, and bolster the detection, tracking and control of infectious disease outbreaks.
Scope:
It is expected that proposals develop:
the technology to allow the pooling, access, analysis and sharing of relevant data, including next generation sequencing;
the innovative bio-informatics and modelling methodologies that enable risk modelling and mapping; and
the analytical tools for early warning, risk assessment and monitoring of (re-)emerging infectious disease threats.
Proposals should be able to demonstrate the feasibility of such extended data mining for the purposes outlined above, as well as its European level added value. The ready-to-use analytical tools and services that are developed should be based on an assessment of the needs of potential end-users in the Member States and on European level, should as far as possible build on and be compatible with existing European initiatives, and should remain available for public use at the end of the project at a reasonable cost.
Proposals should be transdisciplinary and ensure an integrated One Health approach by linking data from a wide range of relevant sources depending on the infectious disease threat. These may include human (e.g. community, hospital or laboratory health services) and animal health surveillance, health registries, microbial and viral genomic data (including next generation sequencing), pathogen resistance data, mapping of vectors, climate and environmental data[1] as well as societal data that are correlates of disease; possible sex and/or gender differences should be taken into account. Solutions for gaps in existing data (addressing both a lack in quality and quantity) should be proposed.
Solutions for interoperability between different data sources should be addressed and integrated. It is expected that quality-controlled data are shared in accordance to the general concepts of the FAIR[2] principles. The use of harmonised protocols in collaboration with other actors is recommended for this purpose. Appropriate regulatory and governance mechanisms need to be foreseen, taking into account different data sharing needs, as well as data privacy and data security aspects for the different types of stakeholders providing and analysing data. The technology and tools developed should be functional outside of outbreaks (i.e. in ""peace time""), so that all stakeholders involved develop a routine use of them. At the same time, flexibility is needed to enable adaptation to different outbreak contexts and situations. The proposal shall foresee, in case of public health emergencies, open access to data at the moment it is generated or no later than one month thereafter subject to any safeguards required to protect research participants and patients, in accordance with the relevant options in Article 29.3 of the Model Grant Agreement.
The use of advanced IT technologies like high performance computing, or geo-localisation data[3] are anticipated. The use of European health research (e-)infrastructures such as those included under CORBEL[4] is encouraged where relevant. The successful proposal(s) should foresee to consult with the end-users at both national (e.g. public health institutes) and European (e.g. ECDC, EFSA) level at key milestones of the project's timeline. If more than one proposal is selected, they are expected to collaborate. In addition, coordination will be needed with the selected proposal from the Horizon 2020 call topic SFS-36-2017 on the establishment of a European Joint Programme on One Health.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 12-15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

The challenge is to enable public procurers to collectively implement PCPs in order to close the gap between supply and demand for innovative integrated care solutions. The objective is to bring radical improvements to the quality and efficiency of public services and service delivery by encouraging the development and validation of breakthrough solutions through Pre-Commercial Procurement[1].
Scope:
PCP actions targeting consortia of procurers with similar procurement needs that want to procure together the development of innovative integrated care solutions to modernize public services whilst creating growth opportunities for industry and researchers in Europe in addition to new markets. These can include, but are not limited to formal or informal organisational solutions, personal-health and self-care solutions, professional care solutions and ICT-based solutions. This topic is open to proposals for PCP actions in all areas of public sector interest requiring innovative integrated care solutions. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different innovative solutions from the healthcare point of view.
Proposals should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the life of the project. Activities covered should include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and PPI, collaborating with respective EU funded projects in the area, as well as awareness raising, technical assistance and/or capacity building to other procurers beyond the project to mainstream PCP implementation and to remove obstacles for introducing the innovative solutions to be procured into the market.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 to 6 million (corresponding up to 90% of the total budget) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Implementation of timely and correct diagnostics for infectious diseases (ID) that will speed up the identification of the causative infectious disease pathogens, possible drug resistances and drug susceptibility is crucial for tailoring the antimicrobial treatment, thus ensuring appropriate antimicrobial drug use. A combination of rapid, accurate and specific diagnostics and correct treatment promises not only to reduce caseloads of multi-drug resistant infections, but also to limit public spending for necessary isolation and hospitalisation by early and correctly identifying the appropriate treatment. In practice however, cost issues hamper the implementation of rapid diagnostics for ID in public health institutions, as innovative rapid diagnostics are still significantly more expensive than culture-based diagnostics. This issue and the lack of consideration of total cost of care limits the uptake of innovative rapid diagnostics in hospitals, which could result in a continued unspecific use of antimicrobials, prolonged hospitalisations and a non-patient centred provision of care.
Scope:
This topic will contribute to the EU One Health Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and should specifically consider the following:
Development of proposals for ‘Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions’ for the implementation of rapid diagnostic tools for infectious diseases in clinical practice. Proposals should be driven by clearly identified procurement needs of the participating organisations. In order to ensure compatibility and interoperability between infectious disease diagnostics and avoid technical/technology standardisation issues, public health procurers should also develop specifications that are applicable for EU-wide deployment of the innovative diagnostics.
Applications should be driven by public and/or private procurers from each participating country (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area of supply of health and care services. They should demonstrate the applicability of the ‘Most Economically Advantageous Tendering’ approach in cross-border collaboration of public procurers in the EU, defining specific outcome criteria of importance for patients well-being, and for innovation of public procurement in the area of infectious diseases and AMR, taking also into account overall economic and societal benefits, and sex and gender differences when relevant..
Proposals should include clear communication and outreach strategies aiming to actively promote and support public health procurement organisations and health care providers across regions and borders of the EU in adopting relevant innovation procurement approaches. They should specify measures that will ensure the sustainability of solutions beyond the lifespan of the proposed project.
Synergies with the Structural Reform Support Program and the European Structural and Investment Fund are encouraged.
Activities covered should include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and PPI, searching support and collaborating with respective coordination and networking projects, e.g. PIPPI and HCO-12. Likewise, awareness raising, technical assistance and/or capacity building beyond the project to mainstream PPI implementation and removing obstacles for introducing the innovative solutions to be procured into the market could be included.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Specific requirements for PPI actions are described in part E of the General Annexes of the Work Programme.
Expected Impact:
Implementation of innovative procurement practices for diagnostics for infectious diseases in the EU, based on the ‘most economically advantageous tendering’ approach and involving newly acquired rapid diagnostic tests in hospital and ambulatory settings.
Contribute to the EU One Health Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, in particular in relation to ‘Better Prevention and Control of AMR’ and the goal to address patient safety in hospital environments by supporting good practices in infection prevention and control.

ECDC (European Centre for Disease Control) and WHO-Europe (World Health Organisation) report high number of cases for HIV and TB infections (both in incidence and prevalence) in the European regions and in recent years the epidemic situation has deteriorated in eastern Europe[1],[2].
For TB, in particular diagnosis and treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses a major challenge. In the east of Europe there is still high burden of TB and HIV and their comorbid forms. Additionally, a significant proportion of the infected patients are also affected by co-infections and comorbidities that may adversely affect their prognosis, which is a global challenge in healthcare and in particular refers to TB/HIV cases.
Several issues in the current epidemiological situation are still to be addressed to reduce the cases of new infections and deaths, including investigation of reasons underlying fast spread of M-DR-TB and HIV/AIDS in some regions, development of rapid tools for an accurate detection of TB infections and management of HIV and TB drug resistance. Adverse effects of treatments and the requirement for strict adherence to antiretroviral treatment further complicate management of these diseases.
Furthermore, in the WHO European Region an estimated 15 million people live with hepatitis C (2.0% of adults) with two-thirds of infected persons in the Region living in eastern Europe and central Asia[3]. Also for HCV there are many challenges, including the need to analyse genetically determined factors affecting disease progression in HCV infected patients (with mono-infection or HIV-HCV co-infection).
Given the dynamics of the epidemics and the need to contain them, there is a commitment from the European Union and from the Russian Federation to support joint research and further strengthen the collaboration between research and healthcare centres to address the issues outlined above.
Scope:
Proposals should address one or more of the following subtopics:
TB: To investigate biomarkers or new diagnostic tests for early screening of TB risk groups for TB infection and identification of antimicrobial drug resistance.
HIV: To investigate the susceptibility to HIV and/or disease progression rate after infection, including various HIV subtypes and/or transmission clusters, and/or the development of adverse effects during antiretroviral therapy and concomitant diseases (comorbidities and/or co-infections, including with tuberculosis).
HCV: To evaluate the genetic determinants of the virus and the host, and comorbid conditions that can be involved in disease progression and create the basis for the development of future HCV treatment strategies.
In performing the research agenda to address one (or more) of the listed subtopics, the applicants might make use of already established European cohort networks or establish new collaborations thus widening their geographical scope and include HIV, HCV and/or TB mono or co-infected individuals and perform retrospective or prospective studies. Proposed actions should take into consideration vulnerable groups and target populations, which may include, but not limited to: ageing subjects, injecting drug users and other social risk groups. Sex and gender differences should be taken into account where relevant.
Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants set out in the General Annexes, proposals shall include at least one participant from the Russian Federation. Also, the duration of the proposed action cannot exceed 24 months (until end of 2020), with a foreseen start of the action no later than 1 January 2019. For more information, interested entities in the Russian Federation shall consult the website of the Russian NCP for Health at http://www.h2020-health.ru/ru/competition-ru-eu, as well as the website of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation http://www.fcpir.ru/participation_in_program/contests/list_of_contests/, where the corresponding Russian call will be published.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improvement of coordination and integration between European and Russian clinical and research centres dealing with HIV, TB and/or HCV infected patients.
Produce scientific evidence leading in the long-term to the reduction of the burden of these infection diseases.

Health technology assessment (HTA) is gaining increasing importance across Europe and the world as a tool to support evidence-based decision-making in healthcare. HTA aims to assess the added clinical/therapeutic value of a new health technology compared to the existing standard of care, under the usual circumstances of healthcare practice (relative effectiveness assessment). HTA can also assess additional aspects of added value (e.g. economic or organisational), depending on the specific context in which it is used.
European collaboration on HTA has increased in recent years, notably in the context of EU-funded projects[1], including work towards shared methodologies and the joint production of relative effective assessments. Despite recent progress, a number of methodological challenges remain in the field of HTA. This includes a need for methodologies that address the specificities of particular types of health technologies[2] and their increasingly combined use in healthcare. Better methodological agreement is also needed in particular therapeutic areas, including on important aspects of relative effectiveness assessment such as health outcome measures. Moreover, there is a need to resolve methodological issues related to the use of ""real-world"" data, to inform the assessment of effectiveness under the usual circumstances of healthcare practice.
Thus the challenge is to address these complex issues and needs, by bringing together methodological expertise from across the various relevant research communities. Such a collaborative effort should draw on the best available expertise and latest evidence, in order to develop methodological approaches that are scientifically sound, fit for purpose and fit for the future.
Scope:
Proposals should develop new or improved methodological approaches and frameworks, and foster methodological consensus-building, to address all of the following areas:
Specific types or groups of health technologies: Help adapt existing HTA frameworks to reflect the specificities of particular types of health technologies97 for which HTA is currently less established but gaining importance. Particular consideration should be given to the increasing role of combinations of technologies, co-dependent technologies (e.g. companion diagnostics) and personalised medicine[3] in healthcare.
Selected therapeutic areas: The focus should be on therapeutic/disease areas where new products frequently face challenges in HTA, but a high unmet medical need persists. Methodological work and consensus-building should be aimed at key issues for relative effectiveness assessment, such as patient-relevant health outcomes, appropriate outcome measures, clinically relevant patient subgroups, and the current evidence-based standard of care. With regard to patient-relevant health outcomes, patient preferences and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) should be taken into account. Particular consideration should be given to strengthening synergies between HTA and clinical guideline development, with a view to more consistent reporting on the clinical/therapeutic value of health technologies.
Use of real-world data: Methodological work should address current concerns and uncertainties around the quality and suitability of real-world data (e.g. from diseases-specific registries and routine healthcare databases) for relative effectiveness assessment in HTA. It should also contribute to broader efforts for improving the collection, comparability and analysis of real-world data across Europe[4].
Implementation: In all of the above areas, part of the efforts should be directed at implementation of methodological work, using e.g. case studies or pilots. Involvement of HTA bodies in all of the above areas should ensure that the needs of HTA practitioners are addressed and uptake in HTA practice is facilitated.
The proposed consortium should bring together partners with relevant expertise from e.g. academia, HTA bodies, regulators, centres of expertise for clinical research and care[5], scientific and medical learned societies, and organisations involved in developing evidence-based clinical guidelines and systematic reviews in healthcare. The consortium should also seek input from relevant stakeholders such as patients, technology developers, healthcare providers and payers. The composition of the consortium should ensure a broad geographical representation of European countries. Gender equality aspects should be taken into account in carrying out the relevant research objectives and activities.
Proposals should complement or build on existing work, including results of EU-funded projects in the field of HTA76. The consortium should closely liaise with EUnetHTA[6] to avoid duplication, build on EUnetHTA existing work and create synergies with ongoing EUnetHTA activities and other relevant EU cooperation efforts.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 5 to 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Should more than one proposal be selected, applicants are expected to collaborate and this should be indicated in the proposal.
Expected Impact:
New or improved methodological approaches, frameworks and consensus-building mechanisms to address the above-mentioned challenges for particular types and groups of technologies, therapeutic areas and real-world data use in HTA.
Strengthened methodological quality of HTA by input of specialist expertise from the broader scientific, clinical research and evidence-based healthcare community.
Improved methodological agreement between HTA researchers across Europe, increasing the impact of HTA on evidence generation, clinical guideline development and evidence-based healthcare.
Contribute to strengthening EU cooperation on HTA, building on ongoing and planned efforts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There are a variety of natural and anthropogenic chemicals that can produce adverse effects via a disruption of the body's endocrine (hormone) system, referred to as endocrine disruptors (EDs)[1]. EDs are of increasing importance in chemical regulations in the European Union, and criteria to identify EDs have recently been presented for two pieces of EU legislation (Biocidal Product Regulation and Plant Protection Products Regulation)[2].
In the EU, the legislation regulating chemical substances often includes their screening and testing according to the EU test methods regulation[3], which predominantly contains test methods developed under the OECD[4]. The current testing tools, including regulatory in vivo tests and novel in vitro assays, do not appropriately identify effects related to certain less studied endocrine-mediated pathways or health outcomes, in which EDs may be implicated. Moreover, the new ED criteria require information about both the adverse effects and the endocrine mode of action.
Scope:
New and improved approaches are needed to increase the quality, the efficiency and the effectiveness of existing methods to meet demanding and evolving regulatory requirements worldwide. In consultation with relevant regulatory bodies, research should improve and harmonise screening and testing protocols/strategies and hazard/risk assessments by developing better and faster tools, test methods or models, including in vitro and in vivo tests, high-throughput and in silico methods (e.g. QSAR), potentially combined with research on adverse outcomes pathways. For in vitro tests, appropriate coupling of their results to human health effects should be ensured. Information is also needed as regards how epidemiological and field monitoring data, which are also to be considered as data sources in a regulatory context, can be used to gain information about possible associations between levels of exposure to specific chemicals and ED-related effects. Focus should be on the most urgent regulatory needs, e.g., methods addressing the thyroid axis, developmental neurotoxicity, metabolic disorders, female reproduction and non-genotoxic carcinogenicity. Proposals should involve, in addition to academic researchers, regulatory agencies and other actors as appropriate. Proposers should consider sex and gender analysis when relevant. International cooperation is essential. Proposals are required to describe how they will contribute to ongoing international ED related activities (e.g. OECD work, EU level databases), including decision schemes under development. To speed up regulatory uptake of tests, validation is an essential step to be included in the proposals.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 4 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Collaboration between successful proposals will be encouraged.
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) as an added value in order to provide an effective interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects and/or to translate the research results into validated test methods and strategies fit for regulatory purpose. In that respect, the JRC will collaborate with any successful proposal.
Expected Impact:
Improved hazard and risk assessment of EDs, including in the workplace.
Novel ED assay candidates for regulatory use.
Support for the OECD work on testing and assessing chemicals for ED identification.
Enhanced international cooperation.
Contribution to the development of an international strategy and guidelines for testing EDs and assessing associated hazard and risk.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Antimicrobial resistance represents a serious threat to public health in Europe and beyond. Within the last decades resistance has increased considerably in many clinically important pathogenic bacteria. Data collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)[1] shows that nowadays in several European countries prevalence levels of infections that can no longer be treated with last-line classes of antibiotics have reached levels where isolation measures may no longer be feasible. In addition to this, prevalence levels of resistant infections are likely to increase in countries where currently such levels are relatively low. This may lead to an increasing number of outbreaks of resistant infections in these countries. The challenge is to address this threat via a multi-disciplinary approach by developing suitable clinical management and infection prevention plans detailing how to deal with resistant bacterial infections in high prevalence settings. The spread of AMR across borders has been recognised globally and improving knowledge on clinical management and infection prevention in high prevalence settings might also benefit other countries around the globe, including low and middle income countries and thereby diminish the spread of resistant bacteria. This topic will contribute to the implementation of the EU One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance[2].
Scope:
Proposals should focus on the identification of best practices, and the development and validation of interventions, infection prevention and clinical management plans for dealing with resistant bacterial infections in high prevalence settings. The research needs to take into account the variety and capacities of local health care/nosocomial infrastructures, and the trends of resistance patterns on local, national and international level, as well as sex and/or gender differences, when relevant. Furthermore, research needs to lead to management plans that take into account commonalities as well as differences between different pathogens and resistance determinants.
The costs and benefits of the infection prevention and clinical management plans to be developed should be assessed as well as the feasibility of their implementation. Research into the practicalities and challenges to introduce such novel infection prevention and management plans is essential and their practical implementation, as pilot actions, in 2 or more European regions with high prevalence levels is strongly encouraged, while taking into account that the infection prevention and clinical management plans to be developed should be applicable for large geographical areas. The potential challenges in the uptake of interventions/management plans by national health systems should be researched and addressed and cooperation with the Joint action AMR and healthcare-associated infections (JAMRAI), ECDC and the EU Health Security Committee is recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a EU contribution of EUR 10-15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Availability of tested cost effective models for prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in health care settings with high prevalence levels of resistant infections.
Reduced spread of resistant hospital acquired infections in these settings.
Knowledge that can be of use for other countries around the globe, including low and middle income countries, benefitting their local population and diminishing the global spread of resistant bacteria.

Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to human health and there are many challenges and needs to efficiently protect citizens across Europe and beyond. There is still a need to understand how antibiotics and other interventions work on patients and how to better assess the effectiveness of vaccines. Innovation is needed to overcome the problem of antimicrobial resistance, and in case of emerging epidemics and pandemics, a timely response to a rapidly emerging infectious diseases is significantly challenging and often delayed. In this context there is a need to establish a pan-European clinical research network that has the capacity and capability to directly enrol patients with infectious diseases, and to increase efficiency for testing and developing new diagnostic, preventive and/or therapeutic strategies and therapies. Europe should also contribute to the G7 aim concerning the need to establish a global clinical studies network on drug resistance that provides access to a large clinical research infrastructure for the design, coordination and conducting of clinical trials and studies. It should also respond to the Council Recommendation on strengthened cooperation against vaccine preventable diseases[1], which calls for the reinforcement and establishment of novel infrastructures to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of EU and national vaccine R&D funding.
Scope:
Proposals should set up a European-wide multidisciplinary network able to provide a platform for a rapid response in the conduct of clinical studies in relation to any severe infection. The initial clinical studies to be performed should be included in the proposal, whereas criteria and processes for including further clinical studies in the project should be clearly described. This should include provisions for flexibility (including re-allocation of budget and de-prioritisation) in case of new scientific developments and in particular the need to address newly or re-emerging infectious diseases.
The proposed consortium should comprise expertise of stakeholders from academic organizations, SMEs, larger industry, patient organisations, ethics committees, public health bodies and regulators. It is expected to perform clinical studies and further advance clinical research in the field of infectious diseases. It should develop new, or make use of existing, standardised methodological approaches to rapidly perform large-scale clinical trials with the view of delivering optimal diagnosis and preventive or therapeutic interventions to patients affected by infectious diseases, taking into account sex and gender differences when relevant. Applicants should build on the results of successful European collaborative initiatives such as PREPARE[2] and COMBACTE[3]. Proposals should build on established structures for infectious disease clinical research at national or regional scales. To ensure the common benefit of the outcomes, it should also work in cooperation with existing global experts networks and infrastructures such as ECRIN[4]and BBMRI[5]. Proposals should in particular take into account the available result of the H2020-funded project ECRAID Plan (project resulting from SC1-HCO-08-2018). The network should address all aspects of clinical trial conduct, from study preparation and design, trial management and reporting. It should develop and allow for innovative research approaches and enable flexibility in responding to unpredictable events during its implementation. The sustainability of the network should be carefully worked out in the proposal. Furthermore, the network should create synergies with global initiatives, enabling quick and smooth interactions and collaboration across the world.
Special attention should be given to EU Member States and Associated Countries with currently limited capacity to perform clinical trials.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 25 to 30 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amount.
Expected Impact:
Reduced cost and time through efficiently implemented clinical trials for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of infections.
Create and strengthen the operational capacity and the infrastructures for providing real-time evidence for optimal medical intervention and practice in infectious diseases.
Contribute to existing EU policies, including the Council Recommendation on strengthen cooperation for vaccine preventable diseases, and the Communication ""A European one health action plan against Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)”[6].
To ensure the EU´s worldwide leadership in controlling and responding to infectious diseases.
Foster links between existing networks in Europe and other countries/regions in the world to optimise a coordinated response to infectious diseases for innovation and delivery of new preventive and therapeutic technologies.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Efficient and effective clinical trials[1] are the primary means to provide scientific evidence to ensure optimal health interventions. Although the randomized controlled trial (RTC) design is regarded as the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of intervention in clinical research, there is a need for new trial methodologies that address current challenges such as:
Globalization of clinical research;
Use of emerging health technologies[2],[3],[4];
Defining patient populations and patient enrolment strategies;
Data management[5].
Given that all clinical research relies on voluntary contribution of patients, new designs may reduce the operational complexity, assure transparency and build trust, meeting all ethics standards and protecting the individuals’ personal identity and privacy[6].
Additionally, non-commercial trials often show suboptimal performance as compared to large commercial trials in terms of data collection, management and processing, good clinical practice compliance, and pharmacovigilance, there is a need of a new methodology that improves their legislative compliance and encourage clinical trials conducted by non-commercial sponsors.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on methodology research and develop innovative solutions to improve the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials. Proposals should identify and validate methods that will improve the generalizability of evidence generated through differently designed trials, including personalized medicine approaches and combinatorial interventions[7]. In order to draw meaningful conclusions following state of the art of statistical analyses, applicants need to demonstrate access to adequate clinical trial data sets that will be included into the proposed research.
The proposed methodology should allow sound extrapolation in various subgroups of disease of high public health burden as well as integration of RTC data and post-approval evidence generation. Furthermore, applicants should identify best practices to prevent bottlenecks in execution of clinical trial, including issues related to patient recruitment, adherence and compliance, governance, ethics, sex and gender-based analysis as well as data sharing.
The special attention should be put on non-commercial trials, including quantifiable indicators to measure the qualitative improvement in terms of trial management, data processing, and reporting. Whenever relevant, proposals should cover different aspects of training exercises, including hands-on trainings and closer monitoring of the scientific and technical staff involved in the conduct, management and analysis of the trial.
All literature analyses to define the current state of the art in the clinical trial methodology research must be completed at the time of submission of the proposal. Methodology research related to clinical studies exclusively on medical devices is not in the scope of this topic.
In this topic, the European Medicines Agency[8] (EMA) and the Commission Expert Group on Clinical Trials[9] will support the selected applicant consortium in the implementation of the action. Successful applicants under this topic are also expected to liaise with the successful applicants of the relevant coordination and support action (CSA) topics[10],[11], in order to exchange information, avoid potential overlapping activities, create synergies and support the CSA goals. To maintain the interactions with the CSA consortia, specific tasks and a dedicated budget should be foreseen in the proposal. Additionally, consultations with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control[12] should also be envisaged as additional relevant activities of the successful proposals.
Please note that this topic will take the form of lump sums as defined in Commission Decision C(2017)7151 of 27 October 2017[13]. Details of the lump sum funding pilot scheme are published on the Funding & Tenders Portal[14]together with the specific Model Grant Agreement for Lump Sums[15] applicable.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Seasonal influenza is a major health burden, with an estimated 500,000 deaths around the world each year.[1] A further threat from influenza is the non-seasonal emergence of new strains, which have the potential to result in major influenza pandemics.
Despite the large danger posed by both seasonal and pandemic influenza, vaccines against flu are only moderately effective.[2] In addition, current influenza vaccines need to be developed every year, as they only work against a narrow range of the hugely variable influenza subtypes, and are also highly vulnerable to strain mutations after an annual vaccine has been developed. Improved influenza vaccines would simultaneously ease a significant global health burden, and help the international community to better prepare in the event of an influenza pandemic.
The burden of seasonal influenza, and the ever-present threat of a new influenza pandemic, is a high priority for both Europe and India. In recent years, significant progress has been made by teams in India and Europe on influenza vaccination. To build on this shared recognition of the importance of influenza, as well as significant expertise available in both regions, a renewed effort by India and Europe towards the development of a next generation influenza vaccine is needed. Furthermore, utilisation of the human challenge model of influenza, or work to improve the model itself, may be an important step to progress this essential field.
Scope:
Proposals should further the advancement of next generation influenza vaccine candidate(s) with improved efficacy and safety, duration of immunity, and reactivity against an increased breadth of influenza strains. Proposals should make use of new knowledge of, for example, structural biology, immunology, genetics and genomics, influenza transmission modelling, vaccine production, formulation and delivery methods.
Proposals should cover at least pre-clinical and/or early clinical research, selecting promising vaccine candidate(s), supporting their proof of concept, showcasing new pre-clinical or clinical knowledge.
The approach taken should include validation of one or more candidate vaccine(s) in a human challenge model[3] of influenza, and/or work to improve the influenza human challenge model itself. This latter work could include comparative testing of potential human challenge strains, and the responses they elicit in volunteers.
The suitability of the interventions to be developed should be addressed and assessed for different population groups, as should the suitability of the candidate(s) to low- or middle-income settings. The downstream constraints for the uptake of the intervention by national health systems should be taken into account.
Due to the specific challenge of this topic, in addition to the minimum number of participants set out in the General Annexes, proposals shall include at least three participants from India. For more information, interested entities in India shall consult the website of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) http://www.dbtindia.nic.in/funding-mechanism/call/# , where DBT will indicate the eligibility conditions to Indian applicants. Proposals should include participants from a variety of different disciplines.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Further the development of a vaccine that could be effective against an increased breadth of seasonal strains and/or from the outset of a large-scale influenza pandemic.
Utilisation of and/or further improvement of the human challenge model of influenza as a tool for candidate vaccine(s) assessment.
Contribute to the reduction of the burden of influenza outbreaks worldwide, particularly in Europe and India. Contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3, to ensure health and well-being for all, at every stage of life.
Specific to India, boost initiatives like the National Health Mission[4] and Biopharma Mission [Innovate in India (I3)][5] of the Government of India by developing affordable biopharmaceuticals, including vaccines, for citizens the world over.

","07 November 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The progress in computer modelling and simulation applied in disease management is a European strength and various Decision Support Systems have been developed for different medical disciplines.
While the market is developing today, addressing the need of more precise and personalised diagnostics and treatments, the proposed software tools and platforms often need to further conquer visibility and trust from users and investors to get implemented in the routine clinical practice. The access of researchers to high quality big data and in particular to clinical multi-disciplinary data is crucial for validating the use of new tools and platforms in the right practice context.
Through its new initiatives on digital health and care within the Digital Single Market policy[1], the European Commission aims at leveraging the potential of big data and high performance computing for the emergence of new personalised prevention and treatments for European citizens. The European Cloud Initiative will facilitate the access of researchers to the newest data managing technologies, High Performance Computing facilities to process data and to a European Open Science Cloud list of ICT services while ensuring the appropriate data safety and protection.
Shared infrastructures, data and services in open cloud-based environments will stimulate the virtual complex experimentations in medicine and the link between researchers and healthcare practitioners, for their common benefit.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to develop and validate software tools and devices for diagnostic or treatment based on computational modelling and simulation applied in biology and physiology. The solutions should enable decision making in complex situations and contribute to a more precise and personalised management of diseases in order to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases, such as cancer.
Computer-based decision making can apply to the choice of drugs, devices or other biomedical products, procedures, interventions, in vitro and in vivo diagnostics methods and tools, or combined diagnostics and treatments. In order to ensure access to large multi-disciplinary high quality data sets and diminish the shortage of relevant data, the teams are expected to use shared infrastructures and e-infrastructures, building on existing capacity and expertise and linking where possible with the European initiatives that manage databases relevant for personal health, such as BBMRI, ELIXIR or EATRIS, as well as with Centres of Excellences for computing applications in the area of biomedicine and bio-molecular research[2] as appropriate. They should demonstrate access to the sufficient and relevant clinical data needed for advanced validations. The work should build on – and contribute to reusable data and computer models. Teams are encouraged to use EOSC services as appropriate and possible.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact in the following areas:
Better translation of big and multi-disciplinary data into predictors for medical outcome and personalised decision making;
New digitised trusted diagnostic and treatment tools, and contributing to digitising clinical workflows;
Improved disease management, demonstrated in the specific disease context;
Links to other European research infrastructure projects and networks operating in related domains;
Contribution to the emergence of a European Data Infrastructure for personalised medicine in the context of the DSM, notably by providing reusable data and computer models for personalised prevention and health treatments;
Better data quality, interoperability and standards.

Digital solutions supporting a continuum of care across a range of health and care services can relieve the pressure on governments to provide more cost-effective health and care systems by improving utilisation of healthcare and health outcomes. In this context the challenges are to network, lead and facilitate health systems research, innovation and digitisation in view of addressing key areas of interventions in health and care services including health promotion and disease prevention.
Scope:
Support the health and care service provider to procure the development, testing and implementation of digital services and communication concepts that can facilitate the transition to integrated care models across health and social services and country-specific cross-institutional set-ups, including decentralised procurement environments and collaboration across institutions. Key challenges that could be addressed are patient empowerment, self-management, patient safety, patient involvement, chronic disease management, diagnosing, home-care logistics, hospital logistics, skills and independent living. These challenges could be addressed by applicable ICT domains e.g., telemedicine, mHealth, IoT, shared open source IT-based platforms, etc. as will be defined in the market consultation process. This should result in early adoption and demonstration of the potential for scaling-up the services and positive impact with evidence of appropriate incentives of various actors.
Proposals should deliver and:
be driven by clearly identified user needs guiding the procurers of the buyers group[1];
be driven by public and/or private procurers from each country participating (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area of supply of health and care services;
demonstrate strong commitment of end-users and their communities in the co-creation process;
as applicable contribute to the use of interoperable solutions based on open platforms and take into account existing best practices and standardisation initiatives;
provide robust safeguards to ensure compliance with ethical standards and privacy protection;
include robust time-lines, a well-structured work-plan aligned to the objectives of the different phases and according particular importance to the role played by the preparatory phase; (templates made available by the Commission are strongly recommended to be used in particular as concerns the call for tender) and;
identify and understand the implications for training (including aspects of organisational, digital health literacy and new collaborative innovation principles and practises), management, and retention of healthcare staff under this topic.
The procurers, hospital clusters, care services providers and other parts of the regional ecosystems should be enabled to share knowledge, test results and needs to better coordinate the primary and community care towards more local responsibility for care services, monitoring and rehabilitation. This may include aspects such as organisational processes, digital health literacy, workforce training, financing and business models, hospital and telemedicine services, home care, patient centeredness, development of shared open source IT-based platforms, data integration, standards and regulatory issues, management and retention of healthcare staff.
The service innovation should facilitate the early adoption and transferability (to other local contexts) of successful solutions addressing the innovation gap. Multi-policy/strategy collaboration across institutions (hospitals and institutions under the responsibility of municipalities), industries, academia and user communities capable of establishing dedicated operational programmes are necessary to safeguard both the service and business performance metrics and the growth potential in the innovation chain.
The proposal should include the methodology foreseen to measure progress towards the key performance areas of quality of care, sustainability and economic value within the selected key area of intervention, see e.g. MAFEIP[2]. Sufficient travel allowances for regular information days concerning the procedures and thematic networking events (e.g. related to relevant co-ordination support actions) should be safeguarded. A plan how to implement the services would be an asset if the outcome of the project is successful. Approaches towards value based procurement are encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around €5-6M would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals of this topic should follow the specific requirements for pre-commercial procurement (PCP) supported by Horizon 2020 grants as set out in General Annex E of the WP.
Expected Impact:
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact in the following areas:
Established path to innovation, evidence of benefits of disruptive technologies that can support the development of sustainable business models, improved user and market engagement, strengthened procurement community, evidence of healthy innovation ecosystem including researchers, users, eHealth and other solution providers and procurers. Evidence in key performance areas i.e., quality in health and care, sustainability of the delivery system and economic value.
Increased opportunities for solution uptake across wider international procurement markets by aiming at interoperable solutions that are validated through field testing by participating procurers in multiple countries across Europe and contribution to standardisation where relevant.

","Research and Innovation action
","04 July 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The number of people with chronic illness is growing and almost half of them have multiple chronic conditions. Patients with complex chronic conditions (CCCs) have chronic multi-morbidities or chronic disease complications that require the attention of multiple health care providers or facilities as well as home-based care. A patient with CCC presents to the health care system with unique constellation of needs, disabilities, or functional limitations[1].
Managing patients with complex chronic conditions therefore needs approaches that ensure multi-disciplinary, personalised and well accepted by the patient ways of care and monitoring.
The controlled randomised clinical trials on chronic diseases provide important information that can be translated in the daily clinical practice, but they often do not comprise sufficient breadth and depth commensurate to the complexity of diseases, and to the degree of personalisation of treatment needed.
Real World Data (referring specifically to any type of data not collected in a randomised clinical trial) can complement these to fill the knowledge gap between controlled clinical trials results and clinical practice needs in real environments. They can provide new insights into disease patterns and help improve the safety and effectiveness of health interventions.
Tapping into this rich resource of ‘real world data’ issued from daily clinical practice, either collected on a permanent/regular basis by public bodies or through devices and mobile applications, , and smartly assembled in combination with clinical studies, should boost both output and relevance of controlled clinical research results.
Scope:
The topic will support clinical research integrating Real World Data from clinical practice or from patient’s daily life and linking them with data collected with a research purpose if relevant.).
The research focus will be on the use of real world data, either newly acquired or from existing sources (such as data from clinical professional societies/associations, cohorts, registers, biobanks or collected through genome research initiatives) to improve the clinical management of adults with complex chronic conditions. The use of new technologies for data analytics and interpretation such as artificial intelligence and computer modelling are encouraged.
The proposed intervention should allow better treatment or monitoring of the person and thus changes in disease progression and/or therapy response. Quality of life, patient safety, psychosocial aspects and well-being are important determinants of complex health conditions and should be addressed whenever relevant. The research should also assess the potential and use of RWD for different health authorities like regulators of safety and quality or health technology assessment bodies. Nevertheless, research has to take duly into account sex and gender differences.
The proposed intervention must add clinical value as well as societal benefits and show feasibility and sustainability in real-life settings. In order to ensure acceptability and sustainability of the intervention early involvement of patients and care providers in the design of the research is considered essential. Similarly, proposals should duly take into account the diversity of health systems in different regions of Europe.
Data protection, data privacy and ethical issues[2] have to be carefully considered as personal data from different sources are to be linked in the course of the proposed research. Data sets assembled under the project, including the linkage to ‘real world data’ should be preserved in a sustainable and accessible way so as to enable future research on the targeted CCC, thus contributing to the overall imperative of Open Science.
Research that focuses on self-management only is not in the scope of this topic. Research on rare and/or infectious diseases are supported through other sections of the programme and are excluded from the scope of this topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrate the potential of the use multi-disciplinary multi-source Real World Data to advance clinical research on complex chronic conditions;
Demonstrate potential and use of RWD, in particular RWD from disease-specific professional societies/associations, by health authorities to understand safety, quality and effectiveness of therapies;
Improve the clinical outcomes as well as quality of life of patients living with CCCs;
Advance the understanding of management of complex diseases including the interdependence of co-morbidities, thus underpinning evidence based therapies and prognostic approaches;
Further development of new technological tools and platforms for advanced data management;
Contribution to the cross-border health data exchange and to the goals of the Digital Single Market[3].

","04 July 2019
","04 June 2020","Specific Challenge:
People-centred care is one of the main goals of health systems[1]. It relates to a stronger orientation towards the needs of people and their involvement in the treatment process and decision-making. This is expected to result in a better care as experienced by people, in less inequality, better health promotion, better disease prevention, and treatments better targeted to people’s needs. Health system transition to people-centred care requires empowering citizens[2] and integration of services[3].
The growing digital transformation of health and care offers great opportunity to achieve this transition. Innovative solutions[4] involving digital tools have the potential to improve people-centred care through self-management, goal orientation and shared decision-making. However, technical innovation is unlikely to achieve the anticipated improvements/impact if not accompanied by supportive organisational and policy innovations. Given the complexity and differences between health systems, cross-national comparative health services and systems research as well as implementation research are needed to better understand the contextual factors that impact the successful introduction, use and sustainability of innovative solutions. This will in turn facilitate their scalability[5] and their transferability to other settings.
Scope:
Proposals should study the scaling-up or transferability of an innovative solution involving digital tools, i.e. the conditions under which it can be implemented in other health systems and whether it can have the same intended effect.
To address this specific challenge, the proposals should:
Identify an innovative solution involving digital tools (or a set of comparable innovations developed in parallel in different settings) with the potential to enhance people-centred care. The selected innovative solution should be described and supported by sufficient documented evidence on its effectiveness in specific contexts and if possible cost-effectiveness.
Design and conduct an implementation study to collect either prospectively or retrospectively (depending on the maturity of the innovative solution) the evidence needed to inform the successful scaling up or transfer to different health systems with particular focus on the contextual factors including legal, ethical, behavioural and social issues.
Identify the key aspects for scaling up or transfer, identify potential barriers, necessary measures/changes as well as facilitators to adopt the solution.
Develop a prediction model to help decision-makers decide on the implementation of the solution as well as guidance to assess the future impact of the transferred solution on health system performance.
Proposals should be multidisciplinary, bringing together expertise in health services and systems research, human and social sciences and implementation research[6]. The main focus should be on improving people-centeredness in Europe but solutions can originate from non-European countries. Gender aspects should be taken into account. Careful consideration should be given to vulnerable groups. Relevant stakeholders including end-users of research and patients’ organisations should be identified and involved throughout the project lifetime. Innovative approaches in gathering patients input should be considered.
The proposals should complement or build on existing initiatives, including (but not limited to) results of EU-funded projects[7].
Selected proposals should provide evidence to support the third pillar of the Communication from the Commission on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market, ''Digital tools for citizens empowerment and person-centred care[8]"".
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU Horizon 2020 research programme of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Availability of methods and strategies for the implementation of innovative, ethically and legally sustainable solutions aiming at improving people-centred care
A better understanding of organisational and system changes, as well as social and behavioural changes required to successfully embed evidence-based innovative solutions involving digital tools into daily practice and ensure their sustainability
Increased scaling up and transfer of innovative solutions improving people-centred care in Europe

[2]Empowering citizens refers among others to enhancing their self management, raising health literacy, involving people through co-production of care and supporting informal carers.
[3]The concepts of integrated services and people-centred care are complementary to each other. Person-centredness not only requires involving people to explore their needs and come to shared decisions about treatment, but also a system-wide policy and organisation of services. Integrated care principles allow care for patients to be better coordinated, and jointly planned by the health and social care professionals across relevant preventive and curative services.
[4]The term “innovative solutions” refers to any service or policy innovations. It encompasses technological innovations, organisational innovations and public health policies. Organisational innovation should be understand in a broad sense including governance, payment, information systems, roles and skills in attaining efficient health care organisations when introducing new technologies.
[5]Scalability is used in the sense of the uptake in larger numbers of the same innovation in comparable organisations and/or in the same sector.

","16 October 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Across the European Union, medicinal products display differences in names, variations in strength or their package size. The unavailability of a specific product may also necessitate substitution in many instances, if a patient is to be timely served in a pharmacy. Moreover, due to differences in marketing authorisation procedures, not every medicinal product is available in each Member State, and it is not unusual that the same product may have different names across Member States or the same name may identify a different product in another Member State. As substitution is regularly necessary to dispense a foreign ePrescription (eDispensation), a univocal identification of medicinal products would enable and enhance the dispensation of a foreign ePrescription and would provide benefits to patient health, patient safety, pharmacovigilance and would also allow better data analysis of clinical records. Most national ePrescription and medicines databases are not currently supporting relevant identification attributes and codes. As the EU-wide implementation of ISO IDMP (identification of medicinal products) standards is currently under way by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the EU Regulatory Network to comply with the EU Pharmacovigilance legislation, this action aims at enabling and fostering the use of a common EU medicinal Product repository (ISO IDMP compliant) to fulfil the ePrescription/eDispensation in a cross-border setting use case. This will provide a univocal identification of medicinal products across Europe and potentially beyond.
Scope:
This innovation action is expected to support two goals: (i) the cross-border mobility of European patients by offering safer eDispensations across borders, (ii) the implementation of the IDMP standards in Member States drug databases (including a possible linkage to the EU SPOR - Substance, Product, Organisation and Referential master data database) allowing the identification of locally available medicinal products which are equivalent to the one identified in a foreign prescription.
This requires creating an EU ePrescription/eDispensing approach to use the future EU SPOR database. A common approach and operating model needs to be developed, including common processes for validation of contents, error mitigation, linkage of the EU SPOR database with the ePrescription/eDispensing systems, updates and mappings to other systems for at least 5 Member States' organisations. Harmonisation guidelines of prescribing and dispensation practices in a cross-border setting could be a further focus.
The proposal should demonstrate its ability to:
Define the additional quality criteria, processes, actors, risk minimisation measures and safety nets to be applied to the data coming from the EU SPOR database to ensure that the data can be safely used by the ePrescription/eDispensing systems and any harm to patient is avoided;
Define and implement APIs or use the ones that will be provided by the SPOR system) for data retrieval/view;
Ensure the quality of data, usability of data for national agencies, determine and support the implementation and validation of adaptations needed at national or regional levels;
Support integration with existing cross-border ePrescription services, such as implemented under the Connecting Europe Facility[1];
Improved pharmacovigilance, inclusion of pharmacovigilance modules capable of reporting adverse drug reactions to relevant regulators using the format defined by the ISO ICSR (Individual Case Safety Report) standard into clinical software systems, validation and diffusion;
Establish a Working Group of European medicinal products database producers to support the implementation of the IDMP standard;
Raise awareness and ensure coordination of pre-competitive activities, cooperation with EMA and the EU Regulatory Network (e.g. national competent authorities), and other relevant stakeholders (producers of ePrescribing, clinical record systems);
Raise awareness and explore benefits for both regulatory and clinical contexts, use cases for public health, big data;
Disseminate to clinical actors (prescribers, physicians, nurses) the ISO IDMP data base contents, usage, value generation and relevance for integrated care;
Contribute to EU-US Trans-Atlantic cooperation and trans-border medicinal products data access and exchange (semantic interoperability);
Ensure compliance with relevant EU legislation, in particular REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;
Contribute, where relevant, to the sustainability and diffusion of European eHealth services, such as implemented under the CEF.
It is expected that Members of the Consortium should include a wide range of relevant stakeholders and experts including inter alia Pharmacists, National Competent Authorities, IT Integrators, producers of ePrescribing, clinical record systems. It should demonstrate its ability to deliver large scale implementation and coordination of European projects. Participation of Industry is encouraged in the most appropriate phases of the project.
The work should also provide an assessment of impacts based on benefits and costs to be anticipated. This should include not only regulatory impact, but also impact on setting global standards and best practice, and impact on clinical data quality and interoperability along with the spill-over effects on pharmaceutical companies, data base producers and competitive advantage of European companies.
Synergies with actions and activities supported by different programmes and policy initiatives of the Commission should be encouraged and resources from previous European projects should be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact in the following areas:
Design and implementation of an IT solution based on the EU SPOR database to support ePrescribing/eDispensing in a cross-border setting is designed and implemented, open for integration with existing cross-border ePrescription and electronic health record services, such as under CEF[2] or H2020
Better address adverse events/effects and safety issues by enhanced development of standard vocabulary for the related reporting;
Better health data access across Europe for patients and healthcare providers;
Improved quality of care resulting in enhanced patient safety;
Improved efficiency gains in term of timeliness of intervention;
Extended healthcare continuum across borders;
Collection and re-use of a data set that is sufficiently large to detect (statistically) significant findings;
Provision of medicinal products information for under-resourced stakeholders.

This may include aspects such as organisational processes, digital health literacy, workforce training, e-health workforce, financing and business models, hospital and telemedicine services, home care, patient centeredness, development of shared open source IT-based platforms, data integration, standards (supporting interoperability) and regulatory issues, management and retention of healthcare staff.
The service innovation should facilitate the early adoption and transferability (to other local contexts) of successful solutions addressing the innovation gap. Multi-policy/strategy collaboration across institutions (hospitals and institutions under the responsibility of municipalities or regions), industries, academia and user communities capable of establishing dedicated operational programmes are necessary to safeguard both the service and business performance metrics and the growth potential in the innovation chain.
The proposals should include the methodology foreseen to measure progress and validation process applicable in the tendering phase, towards the key performance areas of quality of care, sustainability and economic value within the selected key area of intervention, see e.g. MAFEIP[5]. Sufficient travel allowances for regular information days concerning the procedures and thematic networking events (e.g. related to relevant co-ordination and support actions including SC1-HCC-04-2018[6]) should be foreseen. A plan to implement the services should be included. In that context investigation of complementary procurement approaches (see e.g.[7]) including value based procurement are encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals for this topic should follow the specific requirements for pre-commercial procurement (PCP) supported by Horizon 2020 grants as set out in Annex E of the WP.
Expected Impact:
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact in the following areas:
Established path to innovation, evidence of benefits of disruptive technologies that can support the development of sustainable business models, improved user and market engagement, strengthened procurement community, evidence of healthy innovation ecosystem including researchers, users, eHealth and other solution providers and procurers. Evidence in key performance areas i.e., quality in health and care, sustainability of the delivery system and economic value.
Increased opportunities for solution uptake across wider international procurement markets by aiming at interoperable solutions that are validated through field testing by participating procurers in multiple countries across Europe and contribution to standardisation where relevant.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Personalised medicine uses data generated by new technologies to better understand the individual characteristics in order to deliver the right care to the right person at the right time. This approach has substantial potential for tackling major health challenges, such as cancer and rare diseases, helping to deliver better and more effective health outcomes. In order to seize this potential, there is a need to support the large scale pooling of expertise and of genomic and other health data, as well as to identify common standards for the generation, analysis and sharing of this data.
Coordination and support is needed to develop cross-border solutions for sharing expertise and linking genomic and other health data. This should be achieved by identifying relevant initiatives and projects, discerning best practice emerging from clinical implementation and engaging with relevant stakeholders. It is critical to identify common standards for data quality, security, interoperability, privacy, ethical guidelines and governance models underpinning the establishment of sustainable cross-border digital infrastructures and networks for genomics and personalised medicine in Europe.
Scope:
This action should aim to support the identification of common standards, cross-border digital infrastructures and coordination mechanisms to advance personalised medicine in Europe. It should build on existing initiatives, projects and resources at national, regional and European level.
This CSA should consolidate knowledge from existing initiatives and projects to identify the most appropriate practices, standards and governance models for establishing cross-border digital infrastructures supporting genomics research and personalised medicine in Europe.
In a coordinated effort with national initiatives, Research & Innovation projects, and other stakeholders (among them national authorities, health institutions, standardisation bodies, ICT industry), the action should develop coordination mechanisms for sharing expertise and for securely linking genomic and other health data (eg electronic health records, registries, including rare disease registries etc), respecting legal (including but not limited to similarities and differences in EU Member states and associated countries, standardisation, type approval etc.) and ethics requirements. This CSA should identify and facilitate the exchange of best practices between relevant R&I projects, initiatives and other stakeholders. It should provide an overview of relevant standards for data quality, security, interoperability, privacy and ethics. It should identify critical elements of a system of transparent governance of a digital infrastructure enabling the cross-border linking of genomic and other health data in Europe. It should also develop a quality risk management concept for sustainability and further development.
For grants awarded under this topic, beneficiaries may provide support to third parties as described in General Annex K of the Work Programme either in form of grants or prizes. The respective options of Article 15 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting from the EU up to EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact in the following areas:
Agreed standards and mechanisms for the cross-border linking and analysis of genomic and other health data with potential for wide-spread adoption across Europe.
Adequate basis for developing a cross-border digital infrastructure for linking genomic and other health data in Europe.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Health and care service providers and users are increasingly facing complex decisions when exploring and investing in new health and care solutions. There is a need to support cross-border cooperation in preparation of procurement of research and innovative digital solutions, including on how to balance innovation risks with improved outcomes. Further support is also needed for implementing high quality policies, strategies and practises in a concerted manner and providing more confidence in addressing key areas of interventions and related unmet needs, procedures and other measures. In addition there is a need to facilitate an appropriate dialogue with the supply side and academic stakeholders to understand the constraints and possibilities.
Scope:
Create favourable framework conditions for cross-border Communities of Practise (CoP) and create a network that will assist the health & care research and innovation ecosystems in taking investment decisions on future procurement of research and innovation and, eventually, on (large scale) deployment of eHealth systems and new care delivery models. The network should support existing ecosystems, create capacities, promote, co-ordinate, collaborate with other innovation accelerators and investors, and focus on adoption and scale of health innovation European wide. To facilitate sufficient knowledge brokerage all appropriate actors in the innovation chain and systems should be engaged
The consortium should represent a well-designed network of procurers and demand side actors e.g., European regions, national care authorities, NGOs, patient and consumer organisations that have proven experience in the field and the capacity to engage and consult objectively all relevant actors. The consortium should also connect to investors, National Promotional Banks and Economic Development Agencies.
Additionally, diverging expectations and risk management in innovation chain should be addressed by offering a set of support activities beyond the innovation procurement procedures including access to finance and investor networks.
Approaches addressing consumer health should be interlinked in those cases where the institutional health and care services are expected to contribute.
The consortium is expected to assist those procurers that intend to prepare for a cross-border innovation procurement e.g., guiding them to address well-defined unmet needs of users in health and care, use the repositories of best practises and implementation guidelines and providing opportunities for networking.
The findings in earlier co-ordination and support actions for procurers e.g., EPP eHealth[1], Inspire[2] and EAFIP[3] should be taken on-board. Networking with supply and consumer market actors, investors and business accelerators should be well established (e.g. eHealth hub[4][5] , EIT-KIC[5], EIP-AHA[6], AAL[7], ENoLL[8], National Promotional Banks, Economic Development Agencies). The progress in Blueprint Digital Transformation of health and care[9] and EU-US MoU on health IT innovation eco-systems[10] should be incorporated.
The proposal should include parallel activities building up on the competences and capacities of the network including but not limited to:
1) Co-ordinate the development of a multi-collaborative growth policy & strategy of the European health & care procurers and other demand side actors in the quadruple helix[11] systemic context. The knowledge brokerage should facilitate easy migration of competences benefitting the ecosystems at various maturity levels in the innovation chain in thematic Communities of Practise and other professional networks.
In particular, the following elements should be taken into account:
facilitating the development of key areas of interventions in knowledge brokerage settings to get validated and accepted in health & care delivery services integrating data strategy as a fuel of novel digital health services;
linking research institutions, university hospitals in the context of thematic CoP;
education of new collaborative innovation principles and practises;
building upon national initiatives, however, taking into account the Lisbon treaty[12] and
developing the existing or building up repositories of methodologies and set-ups of CoPs
2) Tailored assistance for procurers, regions, cities, national authorities and users to foster sustainable adoption e.g., by developing case specific innovation/business models, giving legal aid, addressing regulation, managing risks, sharing best practises, training and education, access to finance, addressing procurement events etc., interlinking with innovation acceleration of digital health and care industries, other actors.
3) The network should undertake activities that investigate the feasibility and facilitate the concrete preparation of a cross-border PCP for at least one shared common user and procurement need.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to €3M over three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting other amounts or duration.
Expected Impact:
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact in the following areas:
Concerted approach and solutions to the challenges faced by the health ecosystems as perceived by service providers and users in several countries. Increased opportunities for health and care services providers to address unmet needs. Reduced fragmentation of service providers’ demands.
Evidences of support and collaboration with consortia developing unmet needs for innovation procurement and implementation aspects beyond the innovation procurement procedures.
Concrete preparation of a cross-border PCP for at least one shared common procurement need.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The European Commission has promoted scaling up of digital innovation for active and healthy ageing both with research and innovation funding under Horizon 2020 and previous Framework Programmes and with its support for stakeholder partnerships like the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing with its Regional Reference Sites.
In its Communication on “enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market, empowering citizens and building a healthier society” (COM/2018/233 final) the Commission sets out a number of measures for the large-scale use of digital tools for citizen empowerment and person-centred care which are of high relevance for active and healthy ageing. These measures depend on active contributions from local and regional ecosystems, stakeholder groups and organisations including industry, civil society, academia and public administration.
The specific challenge is to facilitate active contributions (in the form of institutional, technological and behavioural change) from all stakeholders to continue on a path towards large-scale deployment of innovative solutions for active and healthy ageing.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to define mechanisms to facilitate further uptake by actively involving partners from the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy ageing as well as other relevant stakeholder groups (e.g. Joint Programming Initiative on More Years Better Lives, Active and Assisted Living programme, EIT Digital and EIT Health), and research and innovation projects, at European, national and regional levels.
The work will build on previous actions and have a clear focus on the successful support to supply and demand sides in implementing scaling up strategies for innovative solutions (technology, integration of health and social care, systemic change). In particular, complementarity and consistency should be ensured with the outcomes, guidelines and strategies delivered in projects funded from SC1-HCO-17-2017 (“Support for large scale uptake of Digital Innovation for Active and Healthy Ageing”), SC1-HCC-01-2018 (""Supporting investment in smart living environments for ageing well through certification"") and SC1-HCC-05-2018 (“Support to a Digital Health and Care Innovation initiative in the context of Digital Single Market strategy”).
A particular focus should be on the development and implementation of a long-term investment strategy, which would leverage and blend funding sources, from European, national and/or regional programmes/promotional banks as well as private investments, and involve new players and partners.
Financial support for upscaling measures and large-scale deployment should be considered in the tasks to be defined for the Coordination and Support Action. These should include twinning programmes[1] and capacity building for local and regional authorities. This action should create a clear and coherent set of recommendations or guidelines for public health authorities in Europe together with a strategy to support their implementation. Proposals are also expected to set up a cooperation mechanism facilitating regular exchanges between the demand (both public and private procurers) and supply (including SMEs and start-ups) sides to identify the difficulties innovators may experience in scaling up solutions across borders in the EU and define measures to improve cross-border deployment of these solutions.
The Action is expected to develop and apply user-centred strategies for implementation of transformative solutions and change management, in particular in the following fields:
mHealth solutions for active and healthy ageing
smart age-friendly homes and independent living
chronic disease management
For grants awarded under this topic, beneficiaries may provide support to third parties as described in General Annex K of the Work Programme either in form of grants or prizes. The respective options of Article 15 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposal should provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and specific impact in the following areas:
Accelerated progress on scaling-up digital innovation for active and healthy ageing across the EU.
Contribution of the policy activities to i) The Quality of Life of the EU population, ii) The Sustainability of Health and Care delivery and iii) Economic growth and job-creation in the EU.
Increased levels of investment by public authorities and private investors in digital innovation for health and active ageing that result from policy activities.
Wider commitment to investment leading to successful and cost-effective implementation of digitally-enabled, person-centred care solutions.
Enhanced market conditions that can facilitate economies of scale for the suppliers of technology and services.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Over 1,000 projects have been funded under the Health theme of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, 2007-2013) and close to 100 projects are already supported under the Societal Challenge 1 of Horizon 2020. These projects have and will lead to breakthrough discoveries and innovations with a potential for further valorisation and exploitation. The translation of research and innovation outcomes into new diagnostics or medicines and improved health outcomes for patients is however hampered by the scattering of knowledge generated across public and private research organisations in Europe. Although Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) have developed tools to promote their organisations’ innovations, there is potential for increased critical mass and visibility of these EU FP7 Health and Horizon 2020 SC1 projects' outcomes.
Scope:
The objective of this coordination and support action is to develop a European web marketplace referencing all types of innovations such as patents, licensing opportunities, prototypes, products, technologies or services with a potential for future exploitation and/or commercialisation, primarily generated by FP7 Health and Horizon 2020 SC1 programmes.
The marketplace should become a one-stop-shop between innovation providers (mainly academic research organisations) and innovation developers (such as SMEs, midcaps and larger companies, EU research infrastructures). The further assessment and/or validation of any high-value discovery shall not be performed within the framework of the proposal.
Further exploitation should be widely promoted to innovation developers; therefore the proposal should detail how it intends to incentivise academia, TTOs, SMEs and the healthcare sector at large to ensure a broad use, exploitation and feeding of the marketplace in Europe. The proposal should include a solid monetization strategy to ensure sustainability of the marketplace after the end of the project.
TTOs with proven track records in exploitation of research results as well as business development departments from healthcare companies should be involved in the consortium to ensure a coherent and consistent approach between innovation providers and innovation developers. Special attention should be given to project outcomes in low performing Member States and Associated Countries[1]. Benchmarking of existing initiatives at European, Member States or international level (such as Enterprise Europe Network or the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Technology Transfer) is a prerequisite. This benchmarking should contribute to identifying best practices, rightly positioning contents and services of the marketplace, as well as defining Key Performance Indicators that will be monitored throughout the deployment of the marketplace.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Development of a sustainable one-stop-shop innovation marketplace promoting primarily EU FP7 Health and Horizon 2020 SC1 project outcomes
Demonstrate clear impact of the marketplace in stimulating in- and out-licensing activity from TTOs, SMEs, and large pharmaceutical companies (ADD)
Identify innovative, sustainable business models increasing the attractiveness of the marketplace, especially towards SMEs

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Technological innovation has triggered an unprecedented increase in data production in health research and healthcare. The need to make EU health research data FAIR (i.e., Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) becomes more pressing than ever before if European health research is to reap the full benefits of this valuable resource. The stakes are high because making optimal use of this health data is expected to both accelerate research discoveries and bring them closer to clinical application for the benefit of EU citizens.
A wide range of challenges needs to be overcome before this vision becomes a reality. To be able to seamlessly integrate and analyse health data coming from different sources and different health sub-disciplines, individual research institutes and/or hospitals would need a potent IT infrastructure and interoperability solutions as well as powerful data analytics tools. Services in the Internet Cloud (i.e., Cloud Services) are a promising starting point to build these systems.
Properly addressing the security and privacy of health research data, and the compliance with various levels of legislations, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the applicable National legislations in the EU Member States/Associated Countries and with different jurisdictions is a critical step for the design of a Health Research and Innovation Cloud (HRIC). These aspects need to be an integral part of the proposal so that the collection, governance, sharing, analysis and curation of health research data across different application domains can be achieved in ways that are technologically robust, scientifically reliable, and ethically and legally sound.
Scope:
The successful project should bring together data-intensive EU health research initiatives to design an implementation roadmap /strategic agenda for a one-stop shop, a HRIC FAIR data portal respecting legal and ethics requirements. It should also define and promote, among research projects, procedures to make data FAIR as well as a standard way of communicating such data, so that any IT-system can easily provide metadata to the portal. This portal would serve as catalogue of all relevant publicly-funded health research databases, registries and infrastructures (e.g., ESFRI) and allow access to high quality health research data. The proposal is expected to build a community (i.e., a wider forum) in order to align strategies and capitalise on the work done by relevant European and international initiatives. The proposal should develop two use cases, where all the aforementioned aspects will be integrated and analysed. These use cases should link health research data, and if relevant, health research data with curated clinical data and health administrative data. The participation of experts in ethics and law as well as patient representatives is strongly recommended.
The proposal should also produce guidelines for researchers to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR regulation, taking into account the specific features of processing personal data in the area of health.
The HRIC should contribute to the European Open Science Cloud[1].
Project results should be widely disseminated to the relevant stakeholders across the Member States and Associated Countries.
The implementation roadmap of the HRIC FAIR data portal will define how to address the specific requirements of health research data. In this sense, the selected proposal is expected to collaborate with the projects funded under topics 'INFRAEOSC-04-2018' and 'INFRAEOSC-06-2019-2020: Enhancing the EOSC portal and connecting thematic clouds', in particular with those in the health field. Grants awarded under these topics will be complementary. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A HRIC FAIR data portal respecting legal and ethics requirements. This portal should serve as catalogue of all relevant publicly-funded health research databases, registries and infrastructures (e.g., ESFRI) and allow access to high quality health research data.
Through use cases, demonstrate the added value of close collaboration of health researchers with healthcare providers and other actors in health care systems.
Guidelines on application of the GDPR and the EU Member States and Associated Countries national legislations. The developed guidelines should cover the processing and further processing of health research data.

Standards are part of the knowledge economy that facilitate innovation and the adoption of new technologies. They are key elements of the competitiveness of European industry. They can improve safety and performance of products and services. Patients would benefit from the standardisation of in vitro diagnostic practice.
Progress in medical diagnostics is limited by insufficient guidelines for pre-analytical procedures and diagnostic services. The accuracy of measured values may be hampered by deficiencies of pre-analytical steps (sample collection, handling, etc.) and poor harmonisation and quality assurance of diagnostic practice (not all diagnostic laboratories are even accredited ISO15189).
Scope:
Provide pan-European quality assurance schemes and guidelines for pre-analytical procedures - such as sample collection, handling, transportation, processing and storing of clinical samples - and/or harmonisation and quality assurance of diagnostic practice.
The proposal should contribute to accreditation and certification, and participate in standardization activities at European level. Interaction with the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR) should be considered as appropriate. Outcomes could be coordination of validation studies, assessment of the results of method validations, training, counselling, quality procedures and guidelines.

The Commission considers that a proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Harmonisation and quality assurance of in vitro ""diagnostic"" procedures for disease diagnosis, patient stratification and/or prognosis of disease outcome leading to improved clinical decisions and health outcomes for the benefits of patients.
Contribution to the sustainability of health care systems by reducing the number of diagnostic mistakes.
Growth and benefit to the European diagnostics industry, in particular SMEs.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
Personalised medicine refers to a medical model using characterization of individuals’ phenotypes and genotypes (e.g. molecular profiling, medical imaging, lifestyle data) for tailoring the right therapeutic strategy for the right person at the right time, and/or to determine the predisposition to disease and/or to deliver timely and targeted prevention. The term ""personalised medicine"" is used throughout this Work Programme with this definition in mind.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Big data relevant to personalised medicine encompasses many different, heterogeneous and complex data sets. The challenge is to harness and understand this abundance and diversity of data to produce medical benefits tailored to the individual or stratified patient groups.
To meet this challenge it is necessary that best practices are defined and widely adopted when using new technologies. For example, health research data production should be compliant with community-based quality standards, coupled with interoperable approaches for data integration and appropriate in-silico models to make sense of the data and produce results of medical relevance. Computational/in-silico models can be used to predict disease evolution, treatment response, and ultimately enable the personalisation of medical interventions
Standards, standard operating procedures or harmonisation strategies are part of the knowledge economy that facilitates innovation and the broader adoption of new technologies by European industry and by the regulatory authorities when approving new medicinal products and/or medical devices. Standards are key elements to facilitate competitiveness of European industry and the success of clinical research.
Scope:
The proposal should establish a forum for in-silico methodologies applied in translational and clinical research, where different transnational initiatives should meet and debate on their standardisation strategies. The project should evaluate the data integration and data-driven in-silico models strategies and identify best practices for integrating and modelling heterogeneous human disease data transnationally. The project should focus on those heterogeneous types of human data which are best structured (addressing relevant ethical implications and sex and gender differences) and thus pose fewer technical challenges for transnational sharing of data. Such data could be in principle biological and clinical data and the models should comprise of several computational models e.g. systems biology, physiological modelling, network analysis etc.
The proposal should deliver recommendations for flexible/adaptable standardisation guidelines for European collaborative research for heterogeneous data integration and data-driven in-silico models with predictive capability to interpret the human disease data while respecting legal and ethical requirements for data protection. In addition to the research standards the project should also ensure that the standardisation guidelines delivered address the regulatory needs in terms of data-driven in-silico models. Such guidelines should be based on open access principles and on interoperable solutions to those standards existing in the industry and used by the regulatory authorities. Inclusion of regulatory authorities could lead to an increased impact of the research proposed, and this will be considered in the evaluation of the proposal.
The action should also aim to organise awareness workshops during which scientists and policy makers and regulatory authorities would debate on future developments of in-silico models in health research.
The proposal should adhere to the general concepts of the FAIR[1] principles, establish links with relevant initiatives already supported by the European Commission and create a collaboration with the relevant ESFRI European infrastructures, IMI projects and the relevant standardisation initiatives e.g. European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research.
For grants awarded under this topic for Coordination and Support Actions it is expected that results could contribute to European or international standards. Therefore, the respective option of Article 28.2 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Harmonisation of health disease data integration and data-driven in-silico models in Europe.
Accelerate the use of academic research data in clinical research and the broader adaptation by research, regulatory authorities and industry community.
Contribution to the sustainability of health research by using the power of health data.
Growth of the European data-driven economy.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Joint Programming Initiative on antimicrobial resistance (JPIAMR) was established in 2011 to enable the participating EU Member States and other countries supporting this initiative to work together to address the rise in antibiotic resistance that threatens human and animal health. Throughout the past four years, the JPIAMR has proven to be an important tool for the establishment of a European Research Area in this field. The JPIAMR launched its strategic research agenda (SRA) in 2014. The JPIAMR is currently implementing this SRA via alignment of national activities and launching transnational research calls.
An immediate challenge for the JPIAMR is to move towards a global initiative. In this context, the JPIAMR should capitalize on the current momentum to take the necessary steps for securing its sustainability by Member States, to extend globally and mobilize the EU Members States which are not yet participating in the JPIAMR. A sustainable structure should allow the JPIAMR to progressively move from coordination to integration of national research activities, to further develop its visibility at global level, and to facilitate greater innovation to address AMR.
Scope:
Proposals should support the development and extension of the JPIAMR capacities. In particular, resources should be used to:
Explore possible scenarios for long-term sustainability by Member States, implement the most appropriate scenarios to ensure full self-sustainability at the end of this project, and create political awareness for implementation. The proposal should also dedicate resources to develop and implement a dedicated structure responsible for the long-term JPIAMR management and implementation;
Extend the capacities of the JPIAMR to the Members States which are not yet participating in the initiative. For this purpose, the proposal should dedicate resources to develop a strategy to attract and raise awareness of the missing EU Member States. This should include identification of available national research and innovation resources in the area of antimicrobial resistance;
Attract global capacities towards JPIAMR and dedicate resources to implement its global strategy. This should include awareness raising and the development of a strategy to attract non-EU countries to join the initiative including low and middle income countries. In addition to this, the JPIAMR should play a key role in supporting the implementation of the WHO global action plan on antimicrobial resistance and the development of a global SRA.
Develop and implement current and new strategies for further coordination of national AMR action plans, research agendas and activities, and in particular for the take-up of JPIAMR strategies and policies at national level. This should clearly demonstrate the leverage effect of the JPIAMR. In this context, the proposal should dedicate resources to develop and implement initiatives for knowledge management, brokerage and transfer, as well as establishing collaborations with other initiatives or partners at European and global level;
Provide innovative strategies for the creation of infrastructures and tools to facilitate more rapid uptake of data and methodologies for research on antimicrobial resistance in the EU and beyond;
Facilitate building networks of industrial and academic experts to boost industrial innovation in the field of antimicrobial research in Europe in collaboration with IMI.
The proposal should not duplicate work already covered under the ERA-NET (HCO 11 – 2015). The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Reinforcing the JPI scheme as a major tool for the achievement of the European Research Area;
Implementing a stronger global dimension of the JPIAMR, aligned with the WHO global action plan on antimicrobial resistance;
Increased multiannual commitment of JPIAMR members, long-term sustainability of the JPIAMR research and innovation strategy, and long-term structuring effect and critical mass mobilization;
Achieving coordination and integration of national research and innovation programmes with the JPIAMR research strategy in coherence with Horizon 2020 objectives;
Faster international progress for research and innovation on antimicrobial resistance through the development of novel research tools and infrastructures;
Increasing efficiency of research and innovation investments by European Member States by avoiding duplication of research and infrastructure investment at national level;
Awareness and potential extension of the JPIAMR to missing EU Member States, as well as non-EU Member States;
Further establishing the JPIAMR as a reference for European and global knowledge and innovation platform in the area of antimicrobial resistance.

The EU Joint Programming Initiative on Neurodegenerative Diseases Research, in particular Alzheimer's (JPND), was established in 2009 as the pilot of the Member State-led Joint Programming Initiatives and enables the participating EU Member States to work together on the challenge of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. JPND allows the establishment, alignment and building on of national research programmes to increase the effectiveness and impact of research efforts.
Building on earlier successes of the JPND Research Strategy in scaling-up and establishing synergies with Horizon 2020, there is a need to continue previous efforts to consolidate the JPND successes in defragmentation, better coordination and alignment amongst the countries participating in the JPND.
Scope:
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from participating national or regional research programmes in the area of neurodegenerative diseases research by implementing a transnational joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding, with a view to scale-up the implementation of the JPND Research Strategy. Proposers are requested to also implement other joint activities, including training and additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
Proposals should also promote the strategic alignment of research activities related to neurodegenerative diseases across Europe, such as developing and aligning national research plans and strategies, making data bases more accessible and interoperable, harmonisation of measurements and methodologies, networking of already existing structures and studies, training etc.
Proposals should demonstrate the expected impact on national and transnational programmes as well as the leverage effect on European research and competitiveness, and should plan the development of key indicators for supporting this.
Participation of legal entities from third countries is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from these countries may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) for the coordination costs of additional activities.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A large proportion of EC and nationally funded projects in biomedical clinical research is focusing either on the development of novel active substances or on the optimisation of pharmacological treatments, such as novel indications or new treatment/dosing schemes for already registered pharmaceutical products.
For such innovations to achieve full impact, it is necessary to file for new marketing authorisations or request significant changes of the regulatory labelling of existing marketing authorisations to bring improvements from academic research into clinical practice. However, in a majority of cases, the clinical research conducted by researchers in academia does not fulfil regulatory requirements and thus, innovations do not reach the patients in a timely and efficient manner. Researchers often do not allocate enough time and resources and also lack specific relevant know-how to develop strategies enabling successful regulatory Scientific Advice procedures. This is partly because regulatory sciences are not well addressed in medical teaching and training programmes.
Scope:
Proposals should; (i) establish, regularly update and disseminate a comprehensive inventory[1] of existing support activities for regulatory Scientific Advice and Protocol Assistance in Europe such as the Innovation Task Force (ITF[2]) briefing meetings; (ii) analyse the effectiveness of existing support activities and develop a common strategy for training programmes to strengthen regulatory sciences and improve support for successful outcomes from regulatory Scientific Advice and Protocol Assistance based on identified best practices; (iii) support and/or advice for the delivery of corresponding pilot training programmes in an efficient and collaborative manner, and (iv) assess the need for and possibly propose additional mechanisms sustainably supporting academic groups in regulatory Scientific Advice and Protocol Assistance procedures.
A crucial objective is to complement, coordinate and/or harmonise efforts among Member States and at European level in order to support the main target group: academic clinical scientists. The aim is to reach these researchers very early in the planning process for relevant grant applications. A further aim is to strengthen regulatory knowledge in general by reaching clinical scientists during professional training and qualifications.
The relevant stakeholders must be involved in the consortium that will implement this action, in particular all interested national competent authorities (NCAs) alongside academic and industry representatives and associations with relevant experience. NCAs should have clearly identified contact points. Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Medicines Agency (EMA[3]), the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA) network[4] and EUnetHTA[5] at European level, in order to ensure (i) the comprehensiveness and validity of analyses, (ii) the feasibility and effectiveness of implemented and implementable activities and (iii) the impact of the whole project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improved knowledge of Regulatory Sciences among academic clinical researchers.
Improved success in regulatory Scientific Advice and Protocol Assistance procedures.
Improved direct regulatory impact of results from academic clinical research to ensure benefits for patients and healthcare systems.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases[1] (GACD) call will focus on implementation research proposals on child, adolescent and adult age onset mental disorders[2] including, but not limited to, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, alcohol- and drug-use disorders, etc., in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and/or in vulnerable populations[3] in high income countries (HIC).
Mental health is an integral part of health as underlined in the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of health as a 'state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'.
Mental disorders represent an ever-increasing burden, to all ages of the population, challenging mental health and health systems. Depression affects 350 million people in all communities across the world and represents the third leading contributor to the global disease burden[4]. Dementia affects 47.5 million people worldwide with 58% of people living with dementia in low- and middle-income countries[5]. Global costs associated with mental disorders were estimated to € 2.2 trillion in 2010 and are expected to rise to € 5.3 trillion by 2030[6].
Mental disorders place a heavy burden on individuals, families, communities and societies. They also increase the risk of co-morbidities and social exclusion. There are obstacles to achieving effective prevention, early identification and management of mental disorders and to ensuring patients' adherence to therapies. Effective management approaches exist but their implementation in LMIC and vulnerable groups in HIC is hampered by socioeconomic and contextual factors: gender; the stigma associated with mental disorders at work, in health care and communities; the role of traditional medicine in dealing with mental health including trauma; and barriers to accessing care. There is a need to strengthen the evidence base for the contextual scalability of interventions of promising or proven effectiveness for the promotion of mental health and the early identification and management of patients, taking into account the needs of different population groups across the life course.
Scope:
Proposals must focus on mental disorders as defined by the WHO (see above), and must focus on implementation research in LMIC, and/or in vulnerable populations in HIC. Proposals must build on interventions with promising or proven effectiveness (including cost-effectiveness) for the respective population groups under defined contextual circumstances. Gender-responsive interventions should be addressed, wherever relevant.
The aim should be to adapt and upscale the implementation of these intervention(s) in accessible, affordable and equitable ways in order to improve the prevention and management of mental disorders in the community in medical health care, psychosocial, and public health and other settings and fields. Interventions should meet conditions and requirements of the local health and social system context and address any other contextual factors identified as possible barriers. When economic factors prevent access to effective, low-cost appropriate medication and other management and treatment modalities, proactive policy and strategies should be encouraged to ensure the availability of such medication or other management/treatment modality or means should be found to overcome these barriers.
Each proposal should:
Focus on implementation research addressing prevention, and/or early identification and/or management strategies derived from existing knowledge about effective interventions.
Include a strategy to test the proposed model of intervention and to address the socioeconomic and contextual factors of relevance to the targeted region and community.
Lead to better understanding of key barriers and facilitators at local, national and international level that affect the prevention and management of mental disorders.
Include health economics assessments as an integral part of the proposed research, including considerations of scalability and equity.
Propose a pathway to embed the intervention into policy and practice addressing:
A strategy to include policy makers and local authorities (possibly by being part of the consortium), as well as other relevant stakeholders such as community groups, patient groups, formal and informal carers and any other group, where ever relevant from the beginning of the project, which will contribute to the sustainability of the intervention, after the end of project.
Relevance of project outcomes/evidence for scaling up the intervention at local, national and international level and then scaled-up appropriateness with respect to the local social, cultural and economic context.
Aspects of stigmatisation and potential equity gaps e.g. due to gender or age.
Proposal must address one of or combinations of the following items:
Structural interventions or evidence based policies designed to improve mental health outcomes;
Early case detection and other secondary or tertiary prevention strategies as well as modalities of treatment, care and access to care which are amenable to scale-up. Prevention, early identification and treatment may include validated pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, psychosocial support and other approaches of relevance to mental disorders such as accessibility to and enhancing compliance with the intervention, also considering cultural context. Wherever relevant, comorbidities and their impacts on prevention and treatment strategies should be taken into account;
Ways to empower people with mental health problems as well as professional and informal care-givers like families according to the context are also relevant;
Exploring the scale-up of family/community engagement in patient treatment and care, without pre-empting their living.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
(one of or combinations of)
Advance prevention strategies and implementation of mental health interventions, alleviating global burden of mental disorders;
Establish the contextual effectiveness of mental health intervention(s), including at health systems level;
Improve tailored prevention and treatment; Develop affordable management and treatment modalities for mental disorders and expand access to care;
Inform health service providers, policy and decision makers on effective scaling up of mental health interventions at local, national and regional levels, including affordability aspects for users and health providers;
Reduce health inequalities and inequities, including due consideration of gender and age issues where relevant, in the prevention, treatment and care of mental disorders at both local and global levels;
Maximise the use of existing relevant programmes and platforms (e.g. research, data, and delivery platforms);
Contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 3[7], the Global Action Against Dementia and the First World Health Organisation (WHO) Ministerial Conference on Dementia[8], the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020[9], and/or the 2015 European Council Conclusions on dementia[10].
The GACD aims to coordinate research on chronic diseases at global level in order to enhance knowledge exchange across individual projects, and to better understand the impact of socio-economic, cultural, geopolitical and policy on research findings, so as to appropriately adapt health interventions to different geographical, economic and cultural settings. Research under GACD involves regular exchange of research findings and information across participating projects by means of cross-project working groups and annual joint meetings. Wherever feasible, projects should harmonise and standardise their data collection and exchange data.
Applicants must budget for annual costs of having two team members participate in one annual face-to-face meeting of the Global Research Network (location to vary annually). Attendance at this meeting is mandatory for 2 team members, with at least one participant from the LMIC team where relevant. Teams are strongly encouraged to include one junior team member in each annual meeting.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious challenge that has reached alarming levels in the EU and globally. There is an urgent need to address this major health threat by actions that should include boosting research and innovation as well as strengthening coordination and cooperation in this area
The Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial resistance (JPIAMR) enables the participating countries that include EU Member States and other countries on five different continents, to address the global threat of AMR. It allows the establishment, alignment and building of national research programmes to increase their effectiveness and the impact of research efforts.
Building on earlier successes in implementing the JPIAMR Strategic Research Agenda, in scaling up research efforts and establishing synergies with Horizon 2020, there is a need to continue and consolidate the successes in defragmentation, better coordination and alignment amongst the countries participating in JPIAMR. In addition to this, there is a need to boost research, development and innovation on AMR and improve global coordination in this area as stated in the European One Health Action Plan against AMR[1].
Scope:
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from participating national or regional research programmes in the area of AMR by implementing a transnational joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding. This should scale up the implementation of the JPIAMR Strategic Research Agenda and the European One Health Action Plan against AMR. Proposals must also implement other joint activities, including additional calls without EU co-funding.
Proposals should take the full One Health approach into account. They should aim at supporting research and innovation for the development and testing of strategies and methodologies to reduce the transmission and spread of AMR. They should also further align national research plans and strategies in Europe and beyond. Proposals should demonstrate the expected impact on national and transnational programmes as well as the leverage effect on European research and competitiveness.
Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries not listed in General Annex A are eligible for EU funding under this topic and may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) only for the coordination costs of additional activities. The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of minimum EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Compared to its size and increasing weight on the R&I international scene, China's participation and cooperation to the Horizon 2020 SC1 programmes is low. This is a lost opportunity because most of the major health challenges are global, and cooperation with China on specific strategic health challenges can contribute to provide more evidence-based solutions and to avoid duplication.
Scope:
The objective of this action is to support networking between European and Chinese policy makers, programme owners and funders, with the following goals:
To develop a sustainable platform between EU and China that will facilitate a constant dialogue on addressing common health R&I challenges.
To identify health challenges, whose solution may benefit from closer bi-lateral and/or multi-lateral cooperation between EU and China, to facilitate and develop collaborative research initiatives between EU and Chinese stakeholders.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 0.8 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased bi-lateral and multi-lateral cooperation on health research strategic items between EU and China.
Higher participation of Chinese researchers in SC1 and future EU health research programmes, but also of European researchers in Chinese health research programmes.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Innovative solutions for healthcare have the potential to improve patient care in European healthcare setting. Integrated care[1] principles allow care for patients to be better coordinated, and jointly planned by the health and social care professionals across vertically and horizontally relevant preventive and curative services. To respond to changing organisation of care and support the transition of hospital services towards a patient-centred integrated care model, healthcare providers are encouraged to join forces and create demand for such innovations through public joint procurement, serving the triple aim of healthcare: better care experience, better care outcomes, and more efficient care.
Implementation of timely and correct diagnostics for infectious diseases that will speed up the identification of the causative infectious disease pathogens, resistance and drug susceptibility is crucial for tailoring the antimicrobial treatment to ensure appropriate antimicrobial drug use and to reduce unnecessary prescriptions. As innovative rapid diagnostics are significantly more expensive than culture-based diagnostics that are widely used since decades, the uptake of these new tests in hospitals and especially primary care centres has been limited. To respond to this clinical and public health need and to facilitate the uptake of innovative rapid diagnostics for infectious diseases into healthcare practice, contracting authorities can act together to create demand for such innovations through public joint procurement.
However, before joint innovation procurement can be undertaken, first the cross-border cooperation between interested healthcare procurers must be established to counter fragmentation of delivering innovative solutions in healthcare settings[2].
Scope:
The objective of this coordination and support action (CSA) is to create a Europe-wide consortium of healthcare providers and public procurers in the health and social care sector that define together unmet procurement needs to implement innovative solutions in healthcare.
The consortium should prepare future procurement topics to conduct:
A PCP/PPI to implement rapid diagnostic tools for infectious diseases in clinical practise (at least 1 topic). To assure the compatibility and interoperability between infectious disease diagnostics and avoid technological standardisation issues, public health sector procurers that participate in this CSA should also develop specifications that are suitable for Europe-wide deployment of the innovative diagnostics.
One or more PCP/PPIs to drive the shift towards health systems reform. Clinicians, patients, public procurers in healthcare systems, health and social care facility managers, and health insurers/payers should work jointly to identify the gaps and needs that will lead to the development of new innovative solutions for patient-centred integrated healthcare.
Activities supported by this CSA should include the following aspects:
preparation of innovation procurement calls to be published in topic SC1-BHC-20-2020 of the Work Programme 2018-2020. That topic will follow the specific requirements for innovation procurement PCP/PPI supported by Horizon 2020 grants as set out in General Annex E of the work programme.
open market consultation with the industry, including on technical and service readiness
analysis of the suitable testing environments
analysis of differences in legal public procurement framework for the participating procurers in health and social care,
market analysis and analysis of potential barriers (standardisation, certification, regulatory requirements, intellectual property rights, contracting models, payment schemes)
consultations with relevant stakeholders, end-users (consumer organisations, reimbursement bodies) to prepare for a future market uptake of the solutions.
Expected Impact:
Improved networking of health and social care providers and public procurers in healthcare systems to identify stakeholders and specifications for a strategy to launch procurement for innovative diagnostics for infectious diseases, and for innovative solutions in integrated care.
Optimised procurement strategy for innovative infectious disease diagnostics and for innovative solutions in integrated care.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU and its Member States have made considerable investments in brain research. The European Commission alone has invested some EUR 5.3 billion over the past 10 years. At the same time, many large research initiatives such as the Human Brain Project (HBP), the Joint Programming on Neurodegenerative Diseases (JPND), the ERA-Net NEURON and the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) have been established in parallel. The numerous resulting research projects have generated considerable amounts of knowledge and innovative approaches. However, translation into new health interventions is below expectations and needs.
Therefore, in many areas of brain research, there is a particular need for better networking and coordination of efforts, at both European and global level, in order to minimise fragmentation and duplication. At the same time, better access to and sharing of data and holistic analysis of results are of crucial importance in line with the EC's Open science policy. Addressing these gaps would create new synergies and open new avenues of research and to which in turn will foster understanding of diseases, innovation and accelerate innovation through the development of new diagnosis, prevention and treatment options in areas of high and unmet medical needs.
Scope:
Proposals should:
Identify areas of neurosciences where the need for enhanced coordination of research communities into active clusters is particularly acute;
Accelerate exchange between researchers in different European research initiatives to promote cooperation and to minimise fragmentation and duplication;
Support the emergence of these clusters, facilitate links with research infrastructures and other major initiatives, in coordination with European Commission services, with the aim of sharing data and enhancing the exploitation of results, fostering new collaborations and identifying future research objectives;
Identify and develop tools and support activities implemented by EU funded initiatives and infra-structures suitable to develop Open Science policy in the neurosciences by sharing and better utilisation of clinical data via IT platforms and also considering any relevant regulatory requirements and policies;
Explore possibilities for broader scale cooperation at global level by fostering dialogue with researchers outside Europe in coordination with research funders around the world, in order to foster the global brain research agenda.
The relevant stakeholders must be involved, in particular thematically focussed research communities, learned societies, large research initiatives, infrastructures as well as relevant funding bodies and regulatory authorities, in order to ensure effective implementation and impact of this coordination action.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 1 to 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Reduce fragmentation and duplication of research efforts and foster synergies through enhanced coordination of brain research efforts at EU and at global level.
Improve access to and optimise the use of research infrastructures and data sources by the neuroscience research communities, thus ensuring better exploitation of the large investments made in brain research.
Achieve critical mass and economies of scale by initiating and fostering new global research initiatives.
Enable and accelerate the translation of breakthroughs in brain research into relevant clinical applications.

Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to global health. Emerging epidemics, pandemics and rising levels of antimicrobial resistance require a strong and coordinated response to protect citizens in Europe and beyond as indicated in the European One-Health Action Plan against AMR. There is a need to establish a clinical research network across Europe that has the capacity and capability to directly enrol patients with infectious diseases, to increase efficiency for testing and developing new diagnostic, preventive and/or therapeutic strategies and therapies. This should allow generating rigorous evidence to improve the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of infections and to better respond to infectious disease threats, and contribute to the G7 aim concerning the need to establish a global clinical studies network on drug resistance that provides access to a large clinical research infrastructure for the design, coordination and conducting of clinical trials and studies in cooperation with the existing global experts networks and infrastructures such as ECRIN[1] to ensure the common benefit of the outcomes[2].
Scope:
Proposals should build on successful European collaborative initiatives such as PREPARE[3] and COMBACTE[4] and further advance clinical research in the field of infectious disease by supporting the establishment of a European wide multidisciplinary clinical research network. Such a network should be capable of performing all clinical trial aspects encompassing study design, execution and reporting (sex and gender differences analysis to be included where relevant). It should develop and allow for innovative research approaches and enable flexibility in responding to unpredictable events and signals. The network should provide clear and direct access for stakeholders including academic organizations, SMEs and larger industry to perform clinical studies. The proposal should develop a business plan to ensure the sustainability of the network. The network should actively disseminate information and contribute to awareness rising. Furthermore, it should also create synergies with global initiatives, enabling quick and smooth interactions and collaboration across the world.
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting an EU contribution between EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amount.
Expected Impact:
Reduce the cost and time of clinical trials for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of infections.
Attract industry back to invest in the development of anti-infectives.
Strengthen the operational capacity and the required infrastructures for clinical research.

Cohorts are invaluable resources to obtain detailed description of individual biological variations in connection with a variety of environmental, pathogenic, occupational, societal, and lifestyle determinants that influence the onset and evolution of diseases. Europe currently has some of the most valuable population and patient cohorts, including well annotated clinical trial cohorts. Several large cohorts have also been developed in various parts of the world. Despite recent efforts to network cohorts, the level of integration need to be escalated in order to optimise the exploitation of these resources, essential to underpin and facilitate the development of stratified and personalised medicine.
Scope:
Building on existing cohorts and in close alliance with relevant research infrastructures, proposals should establish a strategy for the development of the next generation of integrated cohorts, including:
Map the cohort landscape in Europe and large international initiatives. The mapping should include, for instance meta-data on purpose, coverage and measurements and any other relevant information.
Identify best strategies for cohorts' integration, taking into account relevant ethical issues.
Promote the harmonisation of past and future data collection and provide recommendations on standards to improve future sample and data collection.
Foster the inclusion of data emerging from new technologies (e.g. ICT, social platforms), new type of data (e.g. lifestyle, geographical, genetic, eHealth records) and exposure, including to new and emerging products (e.g. novel tobacco products, e-cigarettes, waterpipes).
Promote best practises to optimise access to existing and future cohorts.

Environment and health research is wide in scope and multidisciplinary, and the related policies and regulations are spread across different sectors and organisational structures. In Europe, in addition to the specific policies in sectors such as air and water quality, noise or chemicals, there are currently several overarching policy programmes governing environment and health: the Seventh Environment Action Programme[1] to 2020, the WHO-led European Environment and Health Process[2], the Paris agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[3] and the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development[4]. In order to respond to the new and continuing challenges in environment, climate change and health in the next decade, identified in these and other policy programmes, increased coordination and cross-fertilisation of ideas between sectors is required. This will raise the visibility of the work undertaken, introduce a more strategic approach, thereby optimising and adding value to H2020 and the next EU research framework contributions to environment and health activities and policies in Europe.
Scope:
The aim is to establish a research/policy coordination group consisting of relevant science and policy actors in environment and health from H2020-funded activities and national/EU regulatory bodies as well as relevant international actors. The objective is to identify proactively key policy areas requiring scientific support for environment, climate change and health related issues in the next decade and develop a European medium-term research and innovation strategy and agenda covering key research and policy aspects – from causality research and new technologies and approaches to evaluation of socio-economic impacts of environment and health problems and preventive actions, also in occupational settings. In addition to this strategy, a set of guidelines, agreed by the stakeholder community, reflecting the current state-of-art for health impact and risk assessment of environmental factors applicable across key sectors, should be developed. The action is invited to structure its work in an inclusive way, ensuring the engagement of all stakeholders including from European countries with less developed environment and health research and policy. The proposal should contain a clear work plan for 3 years, but be open for modifications required to meet the needs of the relevant policy processes (e.g. development of the next EU research framework programme, WHO environment and health process).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a three-year duration and an EU contribution between EUR 2 to 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Development of a research and innovation agenda for the environment (including climate change) and health nexus as input to the next EU research framework programme, including for occupational settings and quantification and monetisation of health impacts of policies.

Common challenges in cancer research can only be met by effective transnational cooperation on prioritised efforts, using national, regional and charity-based resources. Important achievements have been obtained by TRANSCAN and TRANSCAN-2.
However, more efforts are warranted to address the potential for sustainable coordination, the access to and sharing of data on cancer research and treatment as well as alignment of national, regional and foundation or charity-based programmes and activities in Member States/Associated States and beyond.
Scope:
The successful proposal should align national, regional research funding programmes on translational cancer research by implementing a transnational call with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes as well, where appropriate, leverage resources from pertinent foundations, charities and transnational initiatives, with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. The proposal should overcome hurdles that impede long-term coordination, involving research and innovation and cancer care stakeholders, taking into account relevant cancer research and innovation and cancer care initiatives. The proposal should build on previous EU-funded ERA-NET initiatives in this area.
The proposal should also demonstrate potential impact at national, regional and transnational research and innovation programmes as well as a leverage effect on national and European research and competitiveness using key indicators. Other joint activities may include: analyses of research and innovation funding and impact, dissemination, communication towards citizens, training, and are requested to include other additional joint transnational calls (without EU co-funding).
The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020 SC1.
Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries not listed in General Annex A are eligible for EU funding under this topic and may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) only for the coordination costs of additional activities. The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020
The ERA-Net should envisage a duration which is appropriate to the ambition and complexity of the proposed topic.

In particular, the proposal is expected to put in place a conformity scheme which should allow entities to test the capabilities of its healthcare products and related services in any accredited testing laboratory against the requirements of a set of standards and profiles that are recognized and listed in the eHealth EIF. This conformity scheme should ensure consistent testing results across testing laboratories and a suitable corresponding trusted label/certificate should be considered. It is expected that the proposal will bring together a wide range of relevant stakeholders with expertise in the development, implementation, assessment, maintenance and dissemination of such a conformity scheme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Develop a core eHealth interoperability conformity scheme for the European market based on the eHealth EIF
Enable healthcare systems suppliers to assess their conformance to the eHealth EIF and advertise such compliance to procurers
Help procurers in their solution specifications and evaluation
Facilitate the development and testing of cross-border, national, and regional eHealth projects
Setting common criteria for effective benchmarking of different European eHealth implementations

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Human health worldwide is increasingly threatened by potential epidemics caused by existing or newly emerging infectious diseases, including those that are resistant to antimicrobial agents. With globalisation, people movement and trade at record highs, pathogens can spread further and faster than ever before in human history. To fight such an international challenge, the EU must think globally and coordinate with international infectious disease research funders.
It is for this reason that the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R)[1] was established in 2013 in response to a request for coordination by the Heads of International Research Organizations. Years on, GloPID-R now provides an important platform for infectious disease research funders to work together to better tackle deadly outbreaks such as Ebola, yellow fever, Zika and plague.
In order to save lives, a research response to an epidemic needs to be quick, flexible, comprehensive and global. For this reason, besides directly coordinating research to infectious disease outbreaks GloPID-R Members also work to improve the underlying international framework in which this research takes place. Ongoing efforts with the network include in-depth discussions on improved data-sharing during outbreaks, creating links between clinical trial networks, and the inclusion of social science into research responses to public health emergencies.
The above work, and more, requires a large amount of administrative support to GloPID-R Members. To maintain GloPID-R, facilitate its ongoing and new work streams, and to increase the effectiveness of the network, further administrative and technical support in the form of a secretariat is warranted.
Scope:
Proposals should provide administrative and organisational support to the Chair and Vice Chairs of GloPID-R, in close collaboration with the European Commission. This includes, but is not limited to, the organisation of meetings and teleconferences, including basic costs associated therewith as required; note-taking and record-keeping; management of information dissemination and communication between the Chairs, Members, Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), Industry Stakeholder Group (ISG), working groups, enquiries, and outside stakeholders. Proposals should also maintain and expand GloPID-R’s external communications activities, such as the website and newsletter, as requested by the Chairs.
Further to administrative and organisational issues, proposals should also provide more technical support on topics requested by the GloPID-R Chairs or groups such as the SAB or ISG. This may include preparing briefings, reports, mapping exercises or presentations. Furthermore, proposals shall take the lead in facilitating the work of the SAB, ISG and a number of GloPID-R working groups. For these reasons, proposals should have a familiarity with research preparedness and responses to infectious disease outbreaks, as well as the ability to facilitate and follow-up on discussions between high-level individuals in a professional manner.
Proposals should also provide a high level of adaptability. The GloPID-R secretariat primarily supports the work of the Chairs of GloPID-R, and should this work alter in scope or direction, remove or add work streams, or otherwise change the activities of the secretariat then it will be expected to have flexibility to change accordingly. In this regard, the selected consortium will be expected to submit an annual work plan to the Commission each year following the annual meeting of GloPID-R. This will take into account the conclusions of the annual meeting and will lay out an adapted plan for activities of the secretariat over the following 12 months as a result. Despite this, changes that alter the grant agreement will require approval by the Commission.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Funding may be complemented at a later date by additional funding from other members of GloPID-R.
Expected Impact:
Effective operation of GloPID-R for at least three years.
Reinforced international cooperation in funding of research in new and emerging infectious diseases, both between for-profit and not-for-profit research funders.
Improved framework for a rapid and effective research response to prepare for or respond to public health emergencies, in areas such as data sharing, social science, clinical trial networks and others.
Better communication of the activities of GloPID-R members, both as a group and individually, to the research community and other stakeholders.

","Coordination and support action
","20 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The area of ICT for active and healthy ageing (AHA) is a new cross-sectorial domain in which standards play a key role. Standardisation efforts in the area tend to be taken by the different domains' actors individually, often lacking a coordinated and targeted approach. Different national/regional initiatives, labels and standards are emerging in some of the related fields, which could potentially make interoperability difficult and impede or reduce scalable growth opportunities. Therefore, an action needs to be established that links together the standardisation needs from the different domains and addresses them in a coordinated way.
This action will support progress within the Silver Economy overall, since it will be directly contributing to its different sectors such as age-friendly environments, smart houses and integrated care. It will thus provide support to the other Active and Healthy Ageing topics published in this Work Programme.
Scope:
The proposal is expected to foster user-centred ICT innovation on AHA by engaging, supporting and coaching stakeholders to develop and implement their actions in the area of standardisation. They should cover standardisation within the area of AHA, in particular in the domains of ICT infrastructures for the implementation and delivery of services for independent living in age-friendly buildings, scaling-up of innovative care services and interoperability profiles for independent living[1].
Relevant activities at national and EU level, as well as by industry should be taken into account.
In order to comprehensively support relevant stakeholders in implementing their actions in the field of standardisation, proposals should clearly address the following:
Mapping of the relevant harmonisation activities in the area and relevant on-going developments, focusing on standardisation efforts;
Fostering cooperation between standard development organisations active in the field of AHA;
Establishing a platform to facilitate discussion and decision-making among relevant stakeholders on the actions to be taken in the field of standardisation in ICT for AHA;
A clear approach for how to engage relevant stakeholders throughout the action;
Identifying harmonisation and standardisation needs in the field of ICT for AHA and the best ways to address them through the various existing mechanisms such as standards, specifications, requirements, procurement, legislation, etc.;
Providing guidance on best practise in co-developing standards and certificates within the covered areas, such as age-friendly environments;
Providing guidance on procurement and coaching on how to best exploit the opportunities to foster innovation in the field of AHA;
Identifying the relevant major standardisation actors and their potential contribution on the needs identified;
Coordinating relevant contributions to AHA standardisation from EU (and national) funded R&I projects.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Engagement of required stakeholders to ensure lasting impact;
Identification of standardisation and other types of harmonisation needs and creation of a clear roadmap with actions needed to address them;
Accelerated progress in the establishment of favourable framework conditions for introducing user-friendly ICT solutions for AHA into the European market and a metrics for measuring the progress;
Elaboration of a first draft for smart / age-friendly home guidelines and roadmap for the development of a certification or label;
Networking and match-making among stakeholders, including R&I projects and relevant standardisation bodies.
[1]Interoperability profiles describe specific solutions to interoperability in a specific use case scenario. A profile documents how standards will be used in order to achieve interoperability. Profiles ensure implementers and users are talking about the same solution without having to restate all the technical details that establish actual interoperability."

Cooperation at transnational level in the area of brain-related diseases has successfully been established but can be further enhanced and sustained through synergies between projects coming out from individual ERA-Net calls as well as pertinent partners beyond the ERA-Network itself.
Specific challenges include providing the necessary critical mass and resources to address commonly identified clinical needs. In particular, data sharing across funded projects should be enhanced. The overall aim is to nurture further collaboration amongst research funders as well as the projects in this field while extending its activities towards the intensification of cross projects collaborations within and beyond the ERANET projects.
Scope:
Proposals should demonstrate the potential to coordinate in a sustained manner national and regional research programmes in the area of brain-related diseases, excluding neurodegenerative diseases, by implementing transnational calls with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties.
Proposed activities should promote wider collaboration between funded ERA-Net projects stemming from the same transnational call but also with relevant projects from other ERA-Net calls and pertinent H2020-funded projects and international partners active in this field of research.
More comprehensive and wider data sharing and early consideration of translational pathways should be inherent requirements for the translational calls to be launched by the ERA-Net.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes as well, where appropriate, leverage resources from pertinent foundations, charities and transnational initiatives, with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area..
Proposal are requested to implement other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020 SC1.Proposals should engage with key stakeholders, including complementary ERA-Nets, competence partners on regulatory and guidelines issues. Collaboration with the EU funded European Brain Research Area Coordination and Support Action should be foreseen and integrated into the joint programming concept pursued by the funded ERA-Net project.
Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries not listed in General Annex A are eligible for EU funding under this topic and may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) only for the coordination costs of additional activities. The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020
The ERA-Net should envisage a duration which is appropriate to the ambition and complexity of the proposed topic. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU a minimum of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Joint investment of national and regional programmes in the area of brain-related neurological diseases;

European Reference Networks (ERNs) have been established under the Directive on Patients' rights in cross-border health care in view of tackling complex or rare diseases and conditions that require highly specialised diagnostic tools and treatments. ERNs in collaboration with other European initiatives will gain major research potential due to their network structure bringing together highly specialised multidisciplinary expertise across Europe and access to patient populations of rare diseases and complex conditions that require highly specialised treatments. Realisation of this potential requires highly organised coordination among the 24 ERNs, which operate in 26 countries, over 300 hospitals and more than 900 health care units, and also with other Europe-led research collaborations beyond the networks, with all the other actors in the field of rare diseases research, especially the European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases. Support for coordination of the research aspects of ERNs is currently limited.
Scope:
This activity will aim at enhancing research and innovation capacity of the ERNs in view of achieving the goals of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) for bringing new diagnostic tools and therapies more efficiently to the patients and for developing methodologies to assess the impact of diagnoses and therapies on rare disease patients, taking into account sex and gender differences where relevant. . Support will be given to identify research priorities and potential synergies among ERNs and coordinate research and innovation activities to be tackled by ERNs. The project should address fostering collaboration in the field of clinical research among ERNs, ERN-independent clinical research collaborations and other stakeholders, such as research infrastructures, industry and patient organisations, as well as international collaboration with other clinical research networks. Close collaboration with the European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases will be necessary to ensure complementarity, to achieve relevant synergies and avoid overlaps. To ensure broad geographical representation and participation across ERNs the proposals shall involve participants from several countries and aim at engaging all approved ERNs and other relevant research networks in Europe.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Along the IRDiRC vision to enable all people living with a rare disease to receive an accurate diagnosis, care, and available therapy within one year of coming to medical attention by 2027.
Contribute to the development of a comprehensive European ecosystem for rare diseases and conditions that require highly specialised treatments, which brings efficiently results of research and innovation to the benefit of the patients.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In May 2017, a new Regulation on medical devices, Regulation (EU) 2017/745[1] entered into force that will come into effect in spring 2020. This new Regulation sets forth reinforced rules for the generation of clinical evidence: for instance, clinical investigations [2] for high-risk devices will be compulsory [3] and the requirements regarding the clinical evaluation[4] throughout the product lifetime are more stringent.
Medical devices have particularities that make the conduct of clinical investigations difficult. Taking into account these particularities, there is a need for methodologies that enable to generate improved clinical evidence. New developments in medical technologies such as mHealth, artificial intelligence, and combination products, pose additional challenges and opportunities for developers[5] to generate high-quality clinical evidence.
Owing to rapid scientific progress and lack of knowledge on the regulatory frameworks among the scientific community, there is a need to raise awareness on new regulatory requirements in terms of clinical evidence. It is important to ensure a smooth transition from the former directive to the new regulatory framework, especially with regard to clinical evidence, by informing stakeholders involved in the clinical evaluation of high-risk medical devices (e.g. academic researchers, clinicians, manufacturers, notified bodies, contract research organisations).
These challenges can be addressed by developing and promoting methodological approaches, including alternative statistical methodologies, adapted to the specificities of high-risk medical devices. These methodological approaches will improve the robustness of clinical data needed at different phases of the product’s lifetime, such as conformity assessment, post-market clinical follow-up, continuous clinical evaluation, post-market surveillance, and potentially relative effectiveness assessment.
Scope:
To address these challenges, the proposals should focus on i) methods to generate clinical data both within the context of a clinical investigation and in daily practice (i.e. real-world data) so that robust clinical evidence is available for high-risk medical devices, and ii) aggregation methods that will allow to make optimal use of all available data taking into account its heterogeneity (e.g. meta-analysis methods using different statistical approaches, methods to combine data from different types of sources) and iii) promote exchange of best-practices and support network activities among developers. Proposals should in particular:
Analyse the particularities of high-risk medical devices and the potential resulting problems with regard to clinical evaluation, carry out a review of the currently used clinical investigation designs for the evaluation of such devices, provide a hierarchy of these approaches, identify gaps to be filled (in particular in view of new developments like e.g. mHealth, artificial intelligence, and combined products) and derive recommendations for the choice of clinical investigation methodology to obtain sufficient evidence.
Develop methodologies for generating clinical data on high-risk medical devices enabling to collect sound data and to use data from different sources including real-world data. These methodologies should be adapted for the needs of conformity assessment and for continuous clinical evaluation throughout the lifetime of the device. Proposals should take into account the various specificities of high-risk medical devices and therapeutic areas if relevant.
Contribute to the exchange of best practices among notified bodies with regard to the assessment of clinical data as provided by developers of high-risk medical devices.
Support networking activities among developers and in particular academic centres with regard to regulatory requirements for assessing high-risk medical devices and foster a pool of scientific expertise on clinical evaluation of high-risk medical devices.
Applicant consortia should bring together partners with relevant expertise from e.g. academia, competent national authorities, centres of expertise for clinical research and care, scientific and medical learned societies. The consortium should also seek input from relevant stakeholders such as technology developers, healthcare providers, health technology assessment agencies and patients, with special regard to endpoints that are relevant for patients. The composition of the consortium should ensure a broad geographical representation of European countries. Sex and gender aspects should be taken into account in carrying out the relevant activities.
Proposals should complement or build on existing work, including results of EU-funded research projects and Joint Actions in the field of medical devices evaluation, and related activities, like e.g. those of the Competent Authorities for Medical Devices (CAMD) and the successor Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG).
Proposals could consider the involvement of The European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) to provide added value regarding aspects like interfacing among the different stakeholders (e.g. developers and regulatory bodies) or contributing to European and international harmonization. In this respect the JRC is open to collaborate with any successful proposal.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amount.
Expected Impact:
Higher quality and reliability of clinical data needed for conformity assessment and continuous market access
Improved knowledge of relevant legislative frameworks and regulatory requirements among all stakeholders involved in the development of high-risk medical devices
Improved evidence on safety and efficacy of high-risk medical devices for the benefit of the patient and health systems.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Several activities on scaling up of digital innovation for active and healthy ageing are currently pursued by the Commission in cooperation with a large number of different stakeholder groups and partner organisations. A coordination and support action is needed to promote the effective uptake and impact of these activities and to leverage additional investments by mobilising other national and regional programmes together with private investments.
Scope:
Proposals should provide support to administration, external communication and coordination of the stakeholder groups and partners engaged in the development and implementation of the following three activities:
(i) Coordinated support to innovators, buyers / industry integrators, distribution networks and investors to facilitate successful introduction of innovations to the market: The work should maximise EU-wide and global market uptake of innovative digital solutions developed by EU funded projects in the area of active and healthy ageing. Under the guidance of the European Commission, this support action will develop and execute an ""Innovation to Market (I2M)"" plan of activities that will enable early cross-border engagement across the EU and internationally. The I2M plan will build on existing European initiatives and networks in this area, and ensure that project innovators leverage these networks and identified market needs together and link to organisations and access to finance facilities that work with start-ups and SMEs.
(ii) Coordinated support to the further development of a European ""Blueprint"" on Digital Innovation for Active and Healthy Ageing: The work should include an updated roadmap[1] setting out the most important ICT enabling technologies (building on technology roadmaps from major EU ICT initiatives behind them) which will impact on key user scenarios in active and healthy ageing in the short, medium and long terms. The support action will enhance the European policy vision and strengthen the community of public and private stakeholders actively supporting it.
The support action will also facilitate the cooperation of key stakeholders, such as industry, financial institutions, investors, insurers, the research community and public authorities (health and care organisations) that are committed to innovate at large scale, to mobilise private investments and identify market opportunities as well as threats to Europe's digital health and care delivery and silver economy sectors.
(iii) Coordinated support to the activities of the EIP on AHA: An important component of the policy vision on digital innovation for active and healthy ageing is the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AHA). Through its strategic implementation plan (SIP) and subsequent Scaling-up Strategy, the EIP on AHA partners have identified a number of priority action areas. Stakeholder action groups have developed action plans for the period of 2016-2018 for implementing innovative services for the ageing population. In its third call launched in 2016, Reference Sites have also committed to undertake investments in scaling up innovation for active and healthy ageing. Since 2015 the EIP on AHA has developed a Monitoring and Assessment Framework (MAFEIP) that is designed to capture the impact of different EIP on AHA activities. Under the guidance of the European Commission and in collaboration with the EIP on AHA Governance Board, the coordination and support action will provide support for the development and execution of EIP on AHA Action Group plans 2018-2020, support Reference Sites initiatives to scale up innovation across the EU, manage the MAFEIP tool to capture the impact of the EIP on AHA activities, strengthen the external communication of the EIP on AHA vis a vis investors, industrial players, start-ups / SMEs and public authorities. The coordination and support action will use the MAFEIP tool to produce outputs illustrating the impact of the EIP on AHA activities on a regular (annual) cycle.
The coordination and support action should provide centralised administrative support, state of the art external communications and operational coordination based on a strategy to support the new I2M plan, the policy vision on digital innovation for active and healthy ageing, and the EIP on AHA.
The coordination and support action will lead to extended reach to (and continued support by) external stakeholders, including industry players, the investment community, health and care organisations, national and regional public authorities and governments. It will seek to establish the foundations for the self-sustainability of the EIP on AHA organisation (beyond 2020).
The coordination and support action will identify synergies, establish communication links and build on relevant research and innovation activities of H2020 and other European Union, national and international programmes targeting Active and Healthy Ageing. This way it may also relate to the WHO's Active and Healthy Ageing[2] strategy by contributing to more effective and personalized health care services to the ageing population.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately with an anticipated duration until 31 December 2020. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should present quantitative and qualitative indicators to capture the impact of the policy actions in the following areas:
Increased uptake of digital solutions for Active and Healthy Ageing, including results from relevant Horizon 2020 research and innovation activities.
Accelerated progress on favourable framework conditions to scaling-up digital innovation for active and healthy ageing across the EU.
Increased levels of participation by external stakeholders in the development and execution of the policy activities as described above (policy vision, I2M and EIP on AHA).
Contribution of the policy activities to i. The Quality of Life of the EU population, ii. The Sustainability of Health and Care delivery and iii. Economic growth and job-creation in the EU.
Increased levels of investment by public authorities and private investors in digital innovation for health and active ageing that result from policy activities.
Enhanced communication with external stakeholders and coordination of activities within the EIP on AHA and between the EIP on AHA and other new or existing policy activities.
Enhanced synergies with other relevant CSAs and Research & Innovation projects financed by the European Commission.

The number of European and international projects and initiatives is increasing but their results and data cannot be properly compared as they have different underlying methods, standards and operating procedures. The International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC) as well as other current initiatives aim to strengthen international cooperation, to increase data comparability and to agree common standards, procedures and methods. There is a need to avoid having the same research carried out multiple times at different places and to better agree at European and at international level. This collaboration should increase coherence and data comparability to better exploit existing microbiome data and clinical information in a standardised way.
Scope:
Proposals should aim for synergistic collaboration and agreement across various research and innovation programmes on the human microbiome, in Europe and worldwide, dealing with sample collection, processing, standardisation and healthy states references at different sites of the human body (not only one organ), including also interaction with omics, impact of drugs, nutritional and environmental aspects as well as sex and gender differences. In particular, they should support the agreement of concrete references of healthy human metagenomes across various different populations. Proposals should map the progress and the state of play for specific disease and health issues as well as the success and meaningfulness in different countries. They should propose concrete and strategic research actions on the human microbiome addressing gaps, emerging fields and political priorities. They should complement, support and enhance cooperation in similar activities within Europe and beyond[1]. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged with relevant partners from outside the EU. Proposals should cover the whole spectrum of human microbiome research from patient data collection all the way to study reporting in publications, social, ethical and legal aspects. Proposals should avoid networking without output and provide appropriate indicators to measure its progress and impact.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1.5 and EUR 2 Million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
International agreement on concrete methods, standards, procedures and in vivo models. Harmonisation and increased comparability of metagenomics, metabolomics and human microbiome data in Europe and beyond.
International agreement on definitive references of healthy human metagenomes. These references should apply across various different populations and allow end-users and citizens to see which microbiome is clinically healthy.
More meaningful results through collaborative synergistic collection of microbiome data from different directions. Improved coherence and reduction of overlap between national, EU and other funding in the area of human microbiome research, thus ensuring an efficient use of the available human and financial resources.
Knowledge exchange and enhanced engagement of citizens, scientists and political stakeholders for priority health risks. Validated results will be delivered faster to people.
Integration of metagenomics and human microbiome references into other multilateral co-operation areas or personalised medicine approaches.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Despite much progress in 'omics' and epidemiological research in recent years, the knowledge on the combined role of genetic and non-genetic factors in health and disease is still limited, thus hampering the full development potential of personalised medicine[1].
There is increasing evidence that interactions with the environment, as reflected in genome-epigenome-proteome-metabolome-microbiome crosstalk, play an important role in disease development and progression. International initiatives such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) and the International Human Microbiome Consortium have generated high quality comprehensive large scale data catalogues and maps. The challenge is to build on the existing high quality data deposited in relevant databases (e.g. but not limited to: http://epigenomesportal.ca/ihec/, http://docs.icgc.org/data-portal) and combine these data and knowledge with lifestyle and environmental data, thus accelerating the translation into novel targeted or personalized interventions. These objectives cannot be accomplished on an individual country level which calls for broad transnational collaboration.
Scope:
The scope of this topic is to integrate and use high quality genome, epigenome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome data produced by large scale international initiatives with innovative imaging, functional, structural and lifestyle/environmental data, and combine these with disease-oriented functional analysis to contribute to the understanding of health and disease with the final objective of selecting relevant biomarkers for clinical validation that will lead to the development of new targeted therapies for diseases of the immune system. Proposals must build on data from IHEC and, as appropriate, on data from other international initiatives. Proposals should address relevant ethical implications, take into account sex and gender differences and include a section on research data management. International cooperation is requested. Proposals addressing rare diseases of the immune system are not in scope of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 12 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Translate big data and basic research results into clinical applications.
Contribute to exploiting data from IHEC and, as appropriate, data from other international initiatives.
Identify and select new biomarkers for clinical validation in stratified patient populations
Develop new targeted therapies for diseases of the immune system with high prevalence.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation proposals should create strategic synergies between scientists across disciplines, sectors and around the globe.

Innovation Actions of one of the following two categories to:
1) Support solutions that are close-to-market (TRL 7) in one of the COVID-19 areas mentioned below and that have already received, or are about to receive, the CE marking to proceed to large scale testing, piloting and deployment operations in critical healthcare areas (or wherever else is relevant) (type 1);
2) Support market innovation (from lab-to-fab) for further developing and maturing innovative solutions that have already been validated in lab environments (TRL 6-7 or higher) with the aim to help accelerate developments and achieve conformity assessment (CE marking) (type 2).
This topic addresses consortia consisting of innovative technology providers, including SMEs, and/or organisations that can offer the range of activities required to address the objectives of the topic; the latter could for example be based on Digital Innovation Hubs, digital health accelerators and knowledge hubs, Centres offering Pilot Lines or similar technology, business and/or knowledge transfer organisations. The innovative technology providers can be either members of the applicant consortia or selected through open calls organised by the consortium using financial support to third parties. The support offered could include access to product development, accelerator, incubator and technical services and capabilities such as testing and experimentation facilities together with expertise, prototyping, design, engineering or pilot manufacturing services as necessary, as well as providing support for medical certification and clinical validation. Any use of third party grants must result in minimal administrative burden for participants, and allow the fastest possible launch of the projects.
The proposed actions could encompass a combination of tools and technologies, such as: microelectronics, micro/nano/cyber-physical systems; bio-functionalized chips and biosensor arrays; bio-photonics; graphene or related materials (GRM); data, AI and robotics; pathogen detection technologies; e-health, telemedicine and digital solutions.
The proposals should address one or more of the following areas:
fast, cost-effective and easily deployable sampling, screening, diagnostic and prognostic systems, including new methods for screening of lungs, using for example AI or advanced photonics solutions, to detect the presence of the pathogen related parameters especially in an early stage of infection;
environmental surveillance (sewage, air, etc.) systems and data analytics as a sentinel for viral (re)emergence and spread in communities, based for example on optical biosensors or genetic detection;
low cost sensors, smart wearable devices and robotics/AI for telemedicine, telepresence and continuous remote monitoring of patient parameters;
protection of healthcare practitioners and the general public improving for example the wetting and filtering properties of fabrics used for face masks; sensors, sterilisation, including robotics and AI solutions, for disinfection and social distancing in environments such as healthcare, public spaces and buildings;
innovative data-driven services and tools combining data assets from various relevant privately held and/or publicly available sources. These could include AI-based solutions exploiting such data and possibly additional sensor-based signals, for diagnostics, prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation. Where appropriate, privacy, data protection and anonymity in the use of mobile warning and prevention applications, as referred to in the Commission Recommendation C(2020) 2296 of 8 April 2020 on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID-19 crisis, should be ensured.
Expected EU contribution per proposal
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow these specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. For proposals with financial support to third parties, up to EUR 10 million may be requested. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The proposers must specify which type of category 1) or 2) above they are addressing; at least one proposal will be selected in each category.
For grants awarded under this topic, beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties as described in part K of the General Annexes of the Work Programme, typically in the order of EUR 20.000 to 100.000 per third party. This is to ensure that the innovators selected though open calls have appropriate resources for addressing the scope and reaching the specific objectives of this topic. The support to third parties may only be provided in the form of grants. The respective options of Article 15.1 and Article 15.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The maximum duration is 2 years.
Applicant consortia planning to launch competitive calls should be ready to do so within a month after the start of the project and proceed to fast-track proposal selection and launch of the selected projects. To this end, they should explicitly provide evidence in the proposal as to how they will reach a very large number of potentially interested organisations and demonstrate convincingly that they can handle actions of this kind and scale (e.g. through a proven track record).
Expected Impact:
To contribute to the public health preparedness and response in the context of the ongoing epidemic of COVID-19 and to ensure the availability of critical technologies and tools.
To contribute to the acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, coverage, and sustainability of diagnosis and clinical management of patients and survivors of COVID-19.
To contribute to proposing recommendations for changes that would allow a fast recovery and a better preparedness, including in the health care systems, for future health emergencies.
To accelerate the deployment and market uptake of mature health technologies for the prevention and optimised treatment of the COVID-19 disease, by delivering results within 3-24 months to end-users at scale."

","Research and Innovation action
","20 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Vaccines offer a safe and cost-effective way to protect large populations against infectious diseases. Yet, many poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases continue to escape attempts to develop effective vaccines.
Disappointing results of recent clinical trials point to bottlenecks in identifying viable candidate vaccines, which, if unaddressed, will continue to present significant risks of failure at relatively late stages of the development process.
The specific challenge will be to shift this “risk curve” in order to better select successful vaccine candidates (and discard those with a higher risk of failure) at an earlier stage of the vaccine development pipeline.
Scope:
Proposals will have to address bottlenecks in the discovery, preclinical and early clinical development of new vaccine candidates (antigens/adjuvants) for malaria and/or neglected infectious diseases[1]. Filoviral diseases are specifically excluded from this topic.
Depending on the maturity of the research landscape for each disease, proposals may range from large research platforms developing multiple vaccine candidates and/or vaccines for multiple diseases, to proposals specifically focused on one disease.
a) The larger platforms proposals should among others:
Take advantage of recent advances in vaccinology (e.g. in silico analysis and novel in vitro and in vivo immunoscreens) or establish completely new approaches for the discovery and selection of novel, appropriately immunogenic antigens, and/or novel formulations/combinations for the generation of new vaccine candidates.
2. Include a systematic approach and define key gate-criteria for selection across each step of the research and development pipeline they address. Based on these criteria the most promising new vaccine candidates, should be able to be compared as early as possible in an objective and transparent process according to their merit in line with effective vaccine portfolio management.
b) Smaller proposals specifically focused on a single disease and/or a single vaccine candidate should adopt similarly innovative and comprehensive approaches to tackle one or more of the major bottlenecks in vaccine development for the specific disease.
For all antigen/vaccine candidates and for all diseases, it is necessary to ensure that a protective immune response (in the specific target population of the vaccine candidate) is adequately understood and that the candidate can elicit such a response.
Depending on the development stage, the downstream constraints of vaccine candidates for effective deployment and utilisation in resource-poor settings should be taken into account. This might include (as early clinical pipeline gate-criteria) considerations of the optimal route and immunization regime, field-deployment logistics (e.g. storing temperatures), as well as an evaluation of the predicted cost and affordability of final vaccine products. If relevant, an assessment of the target population risk-perception attitudes and immunization behaviours should be made and sex- and gender differences should be taken into account.
Both types of proposals should take into account existing mapping exercises on vaccine candidates, as well as the current vaccine development roadmaps and target product profiles for each disease (e.g. Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million for smaller specifically focused proposals, and between EUR 15 and 20 million for the larger platform proposals, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should deliver new vaccine candidates or move existing ones along the vaccine candidate pipeline in support of the sustainable development goal No. 3.3, i.e. to end by 2030 the epidemics of malaria and neglected tropical disease
This should provide reduction in the cost associated with late stage vaccine failure, increasing the number of other candidates which can be tested with the same resources, thus increasing the chance of discovery of an effective vaccine.
Increase the number and quality of vaccine candidates for malaria and neglected infectious diseases available to proceed into further development and clinical testing, if appropriate within the context of the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP2).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Rare diseases are diseases which affect not more than 5 per 10 000 persons in the European Union. It is estimated that rare diseases encompass between 6 000 and 8 000 different entities which affect altogether more than 30 million people in the EU. However, patient populations for individual rare diseases are small and dispersed, which makes international collaboration crucial. Despite the recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases, today many rare diseases still lack means of molecular diagnosis. An accurate molecular diagnosis is an essential starting point for the understanding of mechanisms leading to diseases as well as for adequate patient management and family counselling and it paves the way for therapy development.
Scope:
The aim of this research should be to apply genomics and/or other –omics and/or other high-throughput approaches for the molecular characterisation of rare diseases in view of developing molecular diagnoses for a large number of undiagnosed rare diseases. Undiagnosed rare diseases may range from a group of unnamed disorders with common characteristics to a phenotypically well described disease or group of diseases with an unknown molecular basis. Genetic variability due to geographical distribution and/or different ethnicity should be taken into account as well as genotype-phenotype correlation whenever applicable. In addition, age, sex and gender aspects should be included where appropriate. This large-scale proposal should promote common standards and terminologies for rare disease classification and support appropriate bioinformatics tools and incentives to facilitate data sharing. Existing resources should be used for depositing data generated by this proposal. Molecular and/or functional characterisation may be part of the proposal to confirm diagnosis. The proposal should enable and foster scientific exchange between stakeholders from countries and regions with different practices and strategies of rare disease diagnostics.
The selected proposal shall contribute to the objectives of, and follow the guidelines and policies of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium IRDiRC (www.irdirc.org).
The Commission considers that requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Providing better and faster means of high quality and clinical utility for the correct diagnosis of undiagnosed rare diseases for which there is no or unsatisfactory diagnosis available.
• Contribute towards the IRDiRC objectives.
• Foster dissemination of scientific results and knowledge exchange between stakeholders.
• Develop knowledge management strategies, with the view of facilitating models of care and access to the data gathered.
• Providing better knowledge for improved family counselling as well as to improve follow-up for patients and research initiatives.
• Gather a big number of patients with similar phenotypes to facilitate match making, to avoid duplication and to unravel a considerable number of diagnoses.
• Pave the way to the development of new therapies and for a better treatment outcome in rare disease patients.

","28 July 2016
","11 April 2017","Specific Challenge:
Despite the major advances in understanding disease in the post-genomic era, still a majority of all drugs are effective in only a limited number of patients. From a clinical perspective, implementing knowledge-based decisions on what therapeutics to use for which patients and, if relevant, in which combinations, are extremely challenging. The aspiration to provide more effective therapeutic interventions tailored to the individual or groups of individuals with common molecular phenotypes remains unfulfilled because of the variable response of individuals to such interventions.
Patient stratification aims at grouping patients into disease sub-groups, where the specific pathological processes involved are better defined (clinical/molecular phenotypes). This will lead to the development of targeted therapies, optimizing the intervention to individual patients, thus achieving greater success in treating or curing the patient.
Scope:
Proposals should deliver novel concepts for disease-mechanism based patient stratification to address the needs for stratified or personalised therapeutic interventions. The proposals should integrate multidimensional and longitudinal data and harness the power of -omics, including pharmacogenomics, systems biomedicine approaches, network analysis and of computational modelling. The new concepts of stratification should be validated in pre-clinical and clinical studies taking into account sex and gender differences. Applicants are encouraged to actively involve patient associations. The proposals should consider regulatory aspects of clinical practice and commercialisation opportunities. Proposals should focus on complex diseases having high prevalence and high economic impact.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
New models for patient stratification to inform clinical decision making.
Accelerate the translation of biomedical and clinical research results to medical use.
Increased cost-effectiveness of the novel concepts in comparison to already established practices.

The use of interoperability standards is essential to the wider deployment of an EU eHealth single market. Despite previous Framework Programmes investments, there is still a profound lack of deployed interoperability between healthcare systems and services delivering healthcare and a need to stimulate the public procurement of eHealth solutions and integrated care services addressing complex organisational structures and interactions among people (recipients of care, care-givers, and others). The intention is to stimulate a lively market for innovative, standards-based, and interoperable health-information components.

The proposals should also take into account national eHealth standardisation strategies when they exist. These PPI(s), and any accompanying innovation activities in particular by participating procurers themselves to facilitate the uptake of newly developed solutions, should focus on clear target outcomes such as allowing the sharing of health information, the use of semantically interoperable Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for safety alerts, decision support, care pathways or care coordination. The scope of the PPI(s) is to specify, purchase and deploy innovative ICT based solutions which can deliver sustainable, new or improved healthcare services across organisational boundaries while implementing eHealth interoperability standards, specifications and APIs (e.g. EN13606, HL7, Continua Alliance, IHE...).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Wider uptake of eHealth interoperability standards
Increased suppliers opportunities from wider market uptake of innovative solutions and services by forming a critical mass on the public demand side
Provide solutions for creating a market of innovative, standards-based, and interoperable health-information components
Better solutions specifications designed from a demand side perspective
More forward-looking, concerted, public sector approach to eHealth interoperability
Achieve the wider deployment of eHealth services
Create a European role model in the eHealth interoperability field
Increasing jobs in health and ICT and contributing to economic growth in the EU in the long-term
Support forward looking, concerted public-sector investment strategies that benefit from jointly implementing PPIs across different countries around Europe

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The fast growing ageing population in Europe is bringing new demand-side pressures on public health and care providers. These pressures undermine the long-term sustainability of existing models of delivering care services to the ageing population.
The challenge is to scale up innovative solutions, which have been tested and have demonstrated success in smaller scale settings and that have not yet been deployed on a large scale, by contributing to collaborative efforts in public purchasing of innovative ICT-based solutions for active and healthy ageing. These include inter alia integrated care and active ageing solutions, independent living solutions and telecare, support for self-care and person-centred care. Moreover, take-up of these ICT-based solutions by both public care providers as well as people in need for care is a crucial factor in successfully alleviating the demand-side pressures on public health and care provision.
Scope:
This topic will contribute to the Scaling-Up Strategy[1] of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing and to boosting the Silver Economy and Digital Single Market in Europe. The actions supported will target deployment of active and healthy ageing solutions at large scale across different regions in Europe.
In line with the priority actions of the Scaling-up Strategy, the scope of the PPI pilot(s) is to specify, purchase and deploy ICT based solutions for active and healthy ageing which can deliver sustainable, new or improved services in which public procurement approaches for innovative solutions are successfully applied.
Proposals should:
Be driven by clearly identified procurement needs of the participating organisations and building on a complete understanding of the needs of the ageing population, as well as the needs of the relevant health and care providers;
Support sustainable deployment of new or improved services by providers involved in the procurement of solutions for active and healthy ageing;
Contribute to the creation of scalable markets across Europe in innovative solutions for active and healthy ageing;
Specify measures that will ensure the sustainability of solutions beyond the lifespan of the proposed project;
Engage public and/or private procurers from each country participating (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area of care or supply of services;
Be based on a complete set of common specifications for end to end services;
Demonstrate that the implementation phase will reach ""large scale"" (i.e. sufficient scale to achieve statistical significance) through region-wide deployment across multiple regions of Europe;
Contribute to the use of interoperable solutions based on open platforms and take into account existing best practices and standardisation initiatives;
Provide robust safeguards to ensure compliance with ethical standards and privacy protections and take account of the gender dimension;
Contribute good practices to be made available for replication across other regions (e.g. ""detailed plans"" for larger scale sustainable uptake of innovative solutions for active and healthy ageing, reference material and guidelines, manuals and education materials).
The European Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately through PPI. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Growing awareness and successful use of public procurement to boost ICT innovation applied to active and healthy ageing, ultimately benefiting the growing ageing population across Europe;
Contribution with data and experiences to regulatory and legislative process development addressing potential barriers to procurement of innovative solutions for active and healthy ageing;
Contribution of an open and comprehensive socio-economic evidence base for ICT investments in the field that can support the development of sustainable business models (e.g. cost-benefit analysis, increased efficiency of health and care systems, impact assessments, return on investments, quality of life improvements for users, ethics, safety gain and user satisfaction);
Support initiatives on interoperability and standardisation that can contribute to defragmentation of the market for ICT based active and healthy ageing solutions;
Creation of economic boundary conditions that can support long-term sustainability of health and care systems and emergence of new business models to develop ICT innovation for active and healthy ageing in Europe;
Support forward-looking, concerted public-sector investment strategies that benefit from joint approaches across different regions;
Create new opportunities for market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side for ICT based solutions and services for active and healthy ageing in a Digital Single Market for Europe.
Contribute to inform policy measures that foster the take-up of ICT solutions for active and healthy ageing.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In biomedical, pharmaceutical and toxicology research, the safety and efficacy of biomedical products is ultimately tested on humans via clinical trials after prior laboratory testing in vitro and/or in vivo on animals. The complete development chain of a new biomedical product and its introduction to the market is very long and expensive. Alternative methodologies to reduce the animal and human testing are needed in order to address the safety and efficacy issues of clinical human trials, the ethical issues and the imperfection of predictions issued from laboratory and animals studies when applied to humans. Computer modelling and simulation is currently used to a certain degree in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics or mechanical simulations (e.g. fluid dynamics simulations). A research and technological roadmap[1] on in-silico trials that are the use of individualised computer simulations in testing is currently available showing both strong interest and potential benefit of expanding the computer-modelling in drugs and other biomedical products research.
Scope:
Proposals will develop innovative scientific and technological in-silico trials solutions for product design, development and assessment of drugs and other biomedical products (including products used in nuclear medicine, bioactives, medical foods). The proposals will foresee also the proofs of concepts and methods to demonstrate the capabilities of these solutions to be used in practice. The methods will build on comprehensive biological and biomedical knowledge and advanced modelling paradigms in order to simulate the individual human physiology and physiopathology at the biological levels relevant for the biomedical product under study (e.g. at the cell level, tissue level or organism level) and the interaction with the product. The models and simulations must take into account the variability among individuals (for example, molecular pathways, cellular microenvironments, microbiota, genetics, gender, behaviours, comorbidities, development, lifestyle and environmental conditions). Virtual populations of individuals are to be built for studying the product in single diseases or in particular cases (co-morbidities; composite diseases), for example, from the patient-specific models by variations of different parameters, and must allow simulating the action of the products and predicting the treatments outcomes in order to develop a personalised medicine approach. The proposed in-silico trials will be the result of a multidisciplinary effort (e.g. within the fields of computational modelling, systems biology, tissue mechanics, biology, pharmaceutics, medicine) and must also explore and inform of the reasons for failure should the product be found not efficient or safe and will suggest improvements. To help adopt such computer simulated trials, measures for validation (human trials, animal studies, validation in cell cultures) of the in-silico trials results must also be included in the proposed projects. The benefit for human health, environment and animal welfare must be analysed and quantified. Engagement with regulators and consideration of the regulatory framework issues are highly recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Reducing the size and the duration of the human clinical trials
A more effective human clinical trials design
Leading to a significant reduction in animal testing
Lower development costs and/or shorter time-to-market for new medical products.
Improving prediction of human risks for new biomedical products including medical foods
Improving drug repositioning
Potential of re-use of the developed in-silico models in the chemical testing.
Setting standards for in-silico trials.
Providing libraries of virtual patients for re-use in pre- and post-competitive testing of biomedical products

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A defining characteristic of today’s data-rich society is the collection, storage, processing and analysis of immense amounts of data. This characteristic is cross-sectorial and applies also to healthcare. Big Data is generated from an increasing plurality of sources and offers possibilities for new insights, for understanding human systems at the systemic level to develop personalised medicine, prevent diseases and support healthy life. Primary sources are new eHealth personal solutions, but can be extended also to more generic and commercial instruments, like mobile apps for health and well-being. In addition, social networks can be considered for integrating the social dimension in the analysis of health and well-being scenarios. It is important to assure ethical aspects of data, confidentiality, anonymity of data transfer and engagement of those who collect/ code such data in its analysis and interpretation, in order to avoid misinterpretation and inappropriate conclusions. Greater involvement of those who work within healthcare systems, patients and the public is needed.
Scope:
Rather than improving existing isolated systems, proposals should focus on how to better acquire, manage, share, model, process and exploit the huge amount of data to develop integrated solutions that support public health authorities of Member States and associated countries in particular in healthcare system management, long-term policy making and increase the ability to provide actionable insights at the point of care. Relevant solutions include, for example, systems for determining and monitoring the combined effects of environment, lifestyle and genetics on public health, enabling early identification of effects, both on women and men, that can have large impacts on health including lifestyle and provision of healthcare – both short term and long term as well as when interaction with other public sectors is required (e.g. physical planning). Focus should also be on the governance of Big Data in order to use it proficiently across organisations and at policy levels. Integrated solutions should include suitable approaches towards securing security and privacy issues.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Mapping comprehensive big data in a reachable and manageable way by applying principles for sharing and reusability, creating a network of knowledge by linking heterogeneous data sources for public health strategy;
Emerging data driven analytics and advanced simulation methods to study causal mechanisms and improve forecasts of spatial and temporal development of ill-health and disease;
Develop innovative approaches to improve current risk stratification methodologies;
Turning large amounts of data into actionable information to authorities for planning public health activities and implementation of an approach ""health in all policies"";
Placing prevention strategies on evidence base, evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of implemented strategies, feedback of results into the development of methods;
Analysing the efficiency of patient pathway management both at primary care level (prevention and early detection) and en route encompassing;
Aligning big data and advanced simulation methods in order to provide high-leverage policy analysis for public health officials, across a range of epidemiology challenges;
Cross-border and networking coordination and technology integration facilitates interoperability among the components of Big Data value chain.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
European decision makers and businesses currently lack access to a consistent and authoritative Europe-wide set of climate simulations at appropriate spatial and temporal scales upon which regional, national and local climate-related risk assessments and climate change adaptation programmes and businesses could be built. There is high demand for, and an urgent need to develop, integrated multi-model ensemble climate predictions at European scale which can provide actionable climate information and assessments. This integrated climate prediction system should go hand in hand with coordinated regional modelling and observational studies to constitute a robust foundation for Europe-wide climate service activities. It should be based on user requirements and provide trustworthy and easily accessible climate information which can be utilised across Europe and beyond.
Scope:
The main research objective of this action is to develop an innovative European regional ensemble climate prediction system based on a new generation of high-resolution climate models, covering timescales from seasons to decades initialised with observations. The action should conduct a series of multi-method and multi-model experiments in order to better capture uncertainties, and provide user-centred and demand-driven information which addresses user needs at various levels.
The system should focus on near term (~1-40 years) predictions, which is the time span most relevant for many decisions of businesses and public authorities for infrastructure and other planning.
The regional downscaling programme, an integral part of the multi-model ensemble prediction system, should target Europe at the best technically achievable spatial resolution. Methodologies should be transferable to other geographical areas. Evaluation of model results against observations is considered essential.
Climate model data should be widely disseminated, and therefore need to be easily accessible and available in line with Copernicus Climate Change service specifications.
Strong engagement with stakeholders and climate information end-users, including public sector policy-makers, business organisations and customers representing specific market sectors is an essential requirement of this action.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries having developed similar systems and with countries wishing to develop capacities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 13 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Up to one action shall be funded.
Expected Impact:
The unique ensemble of climate predictions developed in this action should become the reference climate information from regional to local scale across Europe to assess the impacts and risks of climate variability and change as solid basis upon which investment decisions, spatial planning, policy and adaptation options can be built. More specifically, project results are expected to contribute to:
increasing the credibility and usability of climate predictions, and the identification and characterisation of trends in regional climate extremes;
providing an authoritative foundation of climate information to assess the impact of climate change;
boosting climate service market applications at European level for a variety of sectors, based on the new information;
supporting the building of a climate resilient economy and strengthening civil protection;
closing the gap between 'top-down' climate information provisions and 'bottom-up' end-user requirements;
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement.

Responding to the climate change challenge requires climate-informed decision-making at all levels. The challenge is to minimise risks and costs and to seize opportunities.
Climate services (see introduction to this section of the call for a definition) have the potential to build the intelligence behind this transition, through the transformation of the wealth of data, information, model output and related methodologies into customised services and products that mainstream climate change into decisions and actions at all levels.
Bringing climate services to the market requires serving the demand of end-users and developing the business interface between suppliers and users of climate services.
The specific challenge of this action lies in the development of climate services concepts that are ready to be used, or show potential for future deployment, demonstrating the added value of using climate information and services by end-users in their operational decision-making.
Scope:
Proposals should address only one of the following:
a) Demonstration of climate services (2016 – Innovation Action – IA): In order to measure the added value of climate services for end-users, they must be 'user-centric'. As such, climate services need to be co-designed and co-developed through close collaboration of suppliers/purveyors and users. This action will support the user-driven demonstration of climate services in sectors or business networks in which their deployment can already take place at the current state of knowledge, or with limited incremental efforts. Proposals therefore need to prove the maturity and sustainability of the concept, while also addressing the replicability and marketability of the proposed services.
The action funded must respond to a formulated need for climate services by end-users that are served by climate service suppliers or business intermediaries; the demonstration project must be co-designed and co-developed with these end-users. The core of the action should be the demonstration of climate services in relation to issues where climate-related intelligence can support tangible decision-making processes in the public or private domain.
Actions with the main objective of developing supply-driven methodologies, assessing knowledge gaps or pure networking activities will not be funded.
The added value of the climate service provided has to be measurable and should be validated by the end-users collaborating in the demonstration projects. The projects should communicate the added value of the services to other relevant end-user communities that must be specified in the proposal. If relevant, gender aspects in relation to the services may be addressed. The action should also adequately address the barriers which currently hamper the full deployment of climate services in the given area and solutions to tackle these.
Given the focus on demonstrating the added value of a proven concept, the projects should be capable of delivering final results in a relatively short time period (typically within a project duration of two to three years). The funded action for climate services may be part of a larger development (e.g. infrastructure, wind farm) that is funded by additional or follow-up resources, be it private or public. One example is the relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), in particular under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.
The response to the Call for Ideas launched by the Commission in December 2014 showed a wide range of demonstration possibilities with estimated budgets between EUR 0.8 million to EUR 5 million. Based on this outcome, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) From climate service concepts to piloting and proof-of-concept (2017 – Research and Innovation Action – RIA):
This action addresses areas where climate services show potential for being developed. Increasing the added value of climate services relies on matching the demand for services and the competences in the field. However, the availability of data, information and services does not always correspond to users' needs. Within a co-designed process, there is a need to develop future applications in the most promising fields and to mobilise end-user communities where demonstration projects are not yet feasible. This action should co-design (involving both suppliers/purveyors and users) pilot applications that support the proof-of-concept phase of climate services with high added-value in potential markets. The action should create case studies to address methodological issues, develop the user/provider interface, and test the relevance of climate services with a view to co-designing demonstration projects with the end-users at a later stage.
This action focuses on broad areas of application with a European or global scope. Proposals should take into account and where possible build upon activities addressed by other initiatives such as the ERA-NET Cofund action on climate services opened in the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 5 call of 2015.
Actions should foresee activities to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – also under other parts of Horizon 2020.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

facilitating rapid deployment and market uptake of climate services by demonstrating their added value;
providing added-value for the decision-making process addressed by the project, in terms of effectiveness, value creation, optimised opportunities and minimised risks;
increasing the provision of climate services with added value to the end-users;

Deadline date","Scope:
Scope: Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties. The proposal may include, in addition, publicly-funded research performing organisations that will contribute with their own resources (in-kind contributions from their institutional funding). In this case the joint call should include a separate topic for the participating research performing organisations. They will carry out the transnational projects resulting from this call topic themselves. Their participation in the ERA-NET Cofund action must be mandated by the national/regional authorities in charge (normally the responsible Ministry).
The objective should be to undertake research actions to develop better tools, methods and standards on how to produce and use reliable data, new sets of projections and impact indicators relevant for users’ needs and capabilities. These are required by users to assess impacts of and adaptation responses to future climate variability and extreme conditions for specific regions, sectors and relevant time periods (seasonal-to-decadal) at regional and local scale. This should also include consideration of research required to respond to specific requests for services and multi-driver risk analyses, which require an inter- and trans-disciplinary two-way dialogue between scientists, information providers and end-users. Links with international climate service initiatives should be established.
Proposals should promote a wide representation of EU Member States.
Expected impact: Facilitated climate-smart public and private decision-making thereby reducing the impact of climate related hazards and promoting climate-proof management of European resources. Strengthened European integration through more effective exchange and transfer of climate-related knowledge across the EU. Support to the development and widening of the Joint Programming Initiative on Climate. Scientific support to the development of Copernicus operational activities and ClimateAdapt web portal. European contribution to the Global Framework for Climate Services (WMO-GFCS), the Future Earth Programme and relevant actions launched by the Belmont Forum.

Specific challenge: The provision of trustworthy science-based climate information to government, public and private decision makers is a fundamental prerequisite for both properly managing the risks society is facing and seizing the opportunities this implies. In order to meet societal expectations, a significant improvement in the prediction of the climate system (in a seamless way from seasonal-to-decadal and centennial timescales) is needed.
To address these challenges, the climate science community will need to enter into a new era of climate information systems, which take into account the usefulness, provision, accessibility and quality of data. In order to maintain Europe’s leadership in this field and meet the challenges of climate change, significant progress is required in parallel in the development of both climate modelling and science for climate services.
Scope: Proposals should develop a new generation of advanced and well-evaluated global climate and Earth-system models as well as sophisticated climate related prediction systems with the aim of providing to governments, business and society in general state-of-the-art trustworthy scientific input to climate risk assessments at decadal to centennial time scales at the highest spatial resolution possible. Relevant physical, chemical and biological Earth-system processes, including anthropogenic drivers as well as socio-economic aspects and their feedback need to be adequately incorporated into climate models predictions and projections at the appropriate scale. New methods for representing uncertainties in Earth-system models should help to assess the reliability of regional responses and their impacts on key economic sectors. Advanced high resolution Earth-system models should also provide the basis for producing novel climate scenarios. Future models should have the capability of better understanding past climatic variability and its causes and impacts (societies, resources and ecosystems) as well as recent climate records.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Improved science based foundation to better assess the impacts of climate variability and change at decadal to centennial time scales, to support the development of effective climate change policies and optimize private decision-making. Robust, credible and trustworthy climate predictions and projections to make in the medium- and long-term European business sectors more resilient and competitive at global scale.  Project outcome should support the post-AR5 IPCC process and other relevant international scientific assessments, and provide a solid scientific basis for future science cooperation and policy actions at European and international level.

Specific Challenge: Policy makers face societal and economic challenges when addressing climate change, including the need to bring climate action into the wider agenda of economic welfare and sustainable development. Decision-making processes require robust estimates of the costs and benefits, as well as risks and opportunities associated with different mitigation pathways against a background of uncertainty about the future climate and its impacts. It is also necessary to explicitly address the links between the development of low-emission and climate-resilient strategies and other policies to promote sustainable development, and to understand how both the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change is connected to issues such as eradication of energy poverty, increased well-being and welfare, air quality improvement, technology innovation, and food and water availability. To respond effectively to climate change and simultaneously meet sustainable development goals, radical transformations are needed to enable the transition to a clean, low-carbon, sustainable and resilient society, at the national, regional and global levels.
Scope: Proposals shall address the following:
Examining the link between climate change actions and sustainable development through international research collaboration efforts and developing a science dialogue between the EU and international partner countries, with a focus on G20 countries. Proposals should develop technological and socio-economic mitigation pathways and adaptation strategies in the context of wider sustainable development goals, examine actual and prospective mitigation and adaptation policies in various countries to support evidence-based policy making for climate action in the context of sustainable development, and undertake international collaboration with scientists with insights into the local challenges and opportunities. In line with the EU’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] proposals should contribute to provide support for capacity-building and knowledge-sharing goals under the UNFCCC[2] and contribute to major international scientific assessments (e.g. IPCC).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Increased collaboration and cooperation in scientific research between the EU and key target countries in the area of climate action. Support for capacity-building and knowledge-sharing goals under the UNFCCC. Integration of climate action in the broader development agendas for developing countries. Accelerated transfer of low-carbon and adaptation technologies and knowledge to emerging and developing countries. Contribution to major international scientific assessments (e.g. IPCC).

Specific challenge: The majority of the European population lives in urban environments where citizens are frequently exposed to levels of air pollutants exceeding the limit values established by the European directives. The sources of pollution in cities are mainly linked to urban activities such as transport and heating. Other activities such as energy production, industrial activity, agriculture and trans-boundary pollution play an important role. Air pollution and climate change are strongly connected and there is therefore a need to consider both environmental and climate considerations when designing emission abatement strategies. Integrated approaches are needed to find long-term, sustainable solutions in the EU. 
Scope: Development of technological options and strategies to fight against air pollution in urban environments and against climate change ensuring the involvement of the main pollution-generation sectors. Proposals should include the development and application of tools in support of integrated air quality and climate change governance in EU Member States, with the aim of designing and implementing adequate abatement strategies and practices. The specific circumstances of the different regions and cities of Europe and the complex systems dynamics of societal and technological changes required for a transition to air pollution free/low carbon society should be taken into account. Proposals should foster the integration of advanced tools for the assessment, monitoring, modelling – including source apportionment – with innovative technological options and strategies to improve air quality and reduce the carbon footprint of urban areas. Furthermore, awareness-raising actions and policy support activities should be included. Proposals should include the participation of SMEs, as far as possible.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
According the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report, atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800 000 years. CO2 alone has increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions and also from net land use change emissions. Trust in any international agreement under UNFCCC aimed at limiting global warming will depend on our ability to make accurate estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as provision of mitigation services allowing robust reporting and verification against independent data and analyses.
However, a better understanding of the carbon and nitrogen cycle in the earth-climate system remains one of the key knowledge gaps. It is therefore essential that we increase our capability to identify more accurately the stocks and fluxes of these important greenhouse gases and at the same time develop methods and technologies that will enable us within the next five to ten years to accurately estimate and also verify CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from key sources.
Scope:
Actions should quantify more accurately the stocks and fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O in Europe at both regional and continental scales through improved descriptions of key processes and feedbacks, state-of-the art methodologies, models and tools and by exploiting observations from a wide range of monitoring networks (in-situ and satellite). Special attention should be given to independent verification of data reported in countries' greenhouse gas inventories and to the improvement of the methods/approaches currently used for estimating greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. national inventories, tracer transport inversion using atmospheric and oceanic measurements, land-use measurements and models). Proposals should aim to develop widely accepted and scientifically robust methodologies in order to decrease to acceptable levels uncertainties associated with emission estimates and better identify human-induced emissions. The development and improvement of methodologies should also address the need for versatility of application, for example for the tracking of land-based mitigation activities and provision of results relevant to current and potential future land-based GHG accounting systems. Furthermore, issues such as data standards, transfer of information and tools, and replicability of methodologies and tools outside Europe (mainly in developing countries) should also be addressed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
facilitating the development of an operationalised greenhouse gas monitoring, reporting and independent verification system;
improving the ability to monitor and verify greenhouse gas emissions under an international climate agreement by significantly decreasing current uncertainties associated with greenhouse gas emission estimations;
supporting EU climate policies by providing reliable information on greenhouse gases in Europe over appropriate spatial and temporal scales;
providing input (such as data, models, methods) to key international programs and assessments (Global Carbon Project, IPCC, Future Earth);
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement."

Better integration and coordination of on-going and future climate change research and innovation initiatives within the EU and beyond is needed, accompanied by timely and open exchange of information and research results to enhance the impact of research and ensure a more efficient use of resources and scientific developments.
Scope:Creation of EU climate change networks to facilitate dialogue among the relevant scientific communities, funding bodies and user communities in the EU throughout the duration of Horizon 2020 and enhance effective communication and dissemination activities targeting different stakeholders, to maximise the impacts of the research and innovation initiatives and increase public awareness about climate science and research results. Proposals should cover activities such as clustering, co-ordinating and creating synergies between international, EU and nationally funded climate change research and innovation actions, developing joint programmes and projects, creating links with related international programmes, forward looking analysis to establish emerging needs, and effective mechanisms to strengthen science-policy interface. This requires genuinely cross-disciplinary, integrated and systemic approach - including the socio-economic dimension-, as well as the engagement and collaboration between the climate science and the broader stakeholder communities.
Proposals shall address the following issues:
Earth-system modelling and climate services : parallel development of an EU-wide climate modelling and service framework to enable and encourage open exchange of knowledge, expertise and data in order to more accurately simulate climate evolution, and to improve the reliability of science based climate information at local, regional and global scales. It should integrate the EU climate modelling, observations and service infrastructure initiatives and provide a science-stakeholder communication platform to better manage EU resources, reduce fragmentation and improve synergies between national, EU and international activities.
Expected impact: Evidence-based policy and appropriate, cost-effective management, planning and adaptation decisions by the public sector, businesses, industry and society through the provision and effective communication of trustworthy and timely science-based information. Enhanced impact of research and innovation activities through better identification of climate change R&I priorities, improved coordination of EU, Member States' research and innovation programmes and funded activities, and synergies with international research and innovation programmes and actions.

Ice cores contain unique and quantitative information about past climate forcing and responses and have provided essential evidence about mechanisms of climate change, underpinning our understanding of future climate change. The challenge is to extend the record/analysis back to the so called 'mid-Pleistocene transition', when the frequency of glacial cycles changed considerably in response to orbital perturbations. This will allow to better constrain the climate response to future GHG emissions and unravel key linkages between the carbon cycle, ice sheets and atmospheric and ocean climate. A realistic target is to acquire a new ice core from the Antarctic that will contain a record back to 1.5 million years (Myr), but a suitable site where such ice exists has not yet been identified and will require a significant integrated effort.
Scope:
The action should support the preparations for new ice-drilling campaigns in Antarctica and help screen suitable sites where future drilling could provide ice-core records, extending up to 1.5 million years into the past. It should aim to define the feasibility of acquiring a 1.5 Myr ice-core record and establish a technical and logistic roadmap for the development of an international drilling campaign, while developing the financial engineering and the framework for international cooperation necessary to support the future endeavour.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
In agreement with the Commission services, projects should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Securing sustainable access to raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals and construction raw materials, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRM), is of high importance for the EU economy. However, the EU is confronted with a number of technological and environmental challenges along the entire production value chain of primary and secondary raw materials. There is also a need for very innovative and sustainable raw materials production solutions at lower TRLs to bring the next 'digital generation' to the raw materials field.
This specific challenge is identified in the Priority Area 'Technologies for primary and secondary raw materials production' of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope:
All actions should develop sustainable and resource-efficient solutions through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain of non-energy non-agricultural raw materials.
Actions should develop technological solutions finishing at the level of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 3-5.
All actions should contribute to achieving the objectives of the EIP on Raw Materials and to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials by feeding into the EC Raw Materials Information System – RMIS[1]. Actions should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU about the importance of raw materials for society, the challenges related to their supply within the EU and about proposed solutions which could help to improve society's acceptance of and trust in sustainable raw materials production in the EU.
In support of the EIP on Raw Materials actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Breakthrough concepts and solutions for sustainable exploration, mining and/or processing (2018): Actions should develop ground-breaking concepts and solutions for exploration, mining and/or raw materials processing to secure the sustainable access to abiotic raw materials for the EU in the long term and to gain the trust of society in clean and safe production of raw materials. Recycling of end-of-life products is excluded from this topic. Solutions for marine mineral resources are also excluded from this sub-topic.
b) Digital mine (2019): Actions should develop an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform to significantly enhance the efficiency of mining operations by connecting cyber and physical systems and devices to extract valuable insights from their data, in order to improve the decision-making process, better address customer requirements, and to address health and safety aspects, environmental performance, increased automation, predictive maintenance, resource efficiency and real-time coordination of operations. Usage scenarios for mining operations should be presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed IIoT approach. Actions should promote the adoption of IIoT platforms in the mining sector at EU level.
c) Recovery of metals and minerals from sea resources (2019): Actions should develop new technological solutions for the processing of minerals and metals from sea resources, including seawater brines, and/or the seabed in a sustainable way addressing the challenges of industrial viability of the whole process and accessibility, and responsibly addressing the environmental impacts. In the case of minerals and metals dissolved in sea water, actions should demonstrate the technological feasibility and cost-effectiveness of highly efficient and effective recovery processes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
pushing the EU to the forefront in the relevant areas through generated know how (planned patents, publications in high impact journals and joint public-private publications etc.);
safeguarding environmental sustainability (including better energy and water efficiency and a reduction in waste, wastewater and emissions) and improving significantly the health and safety performance of the solutions provided throughout the whole life cycle considered;
creating a lower TRL technology base for radical innovations within the next decades in the sectors concerned that would help unlock substantial reserves of new or currently unexploited resources within the EU;
in the longer term, improving the economic viability of operations and enhancing the competitiveness of, and creating added value and new jobs in raw materials producing, equipment manufacturing, information and communication technologies and/or downstream industries.

","14 November 2018
","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Securing the sustainable access to raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals and construction raw materials, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRM), is of high importance for the EU economy. Substitution provides an alternative approach to reduce the EU’s consumption of CRMs and decrease the relative dependence upon imports as well as related adverse environmental impact, and therefore ensures the sustainable supply of critical raw materials to the EU.
The challenge for industry is to scale up promising technologies raw materials production or substitution of critical raw materials, and to demonstrate that raw materials can be produced in an innovative and sustainable way in order to ensure that research and innovation end up on the market, to strengthen the competitiveness of the European raw materials industries, to meet the ambitious energy and climate targets for 2030, to minimise environmental impacts and risks and to gain the trust of EU citizens in the raw materials sector.
This specific challenge addresses two major targets of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials: the development of ""innovative pilot actions""[1]
(subtopic c)) and finding substitutes for at least 3 applications of critical and scarce raw materials (subtopic d)).
Scope:
Actions should develop innovative pilots demonstrating clean and sustainable production or substitution of non-energy non-agricultural raw materials in the EU, finishing at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-7.
All actions should contribute to achieving the objectives and targets of the EIP on Raw Materials and to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials by feeding into the EC Raw Materials Information System – RMIS[2].
Actions should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU about the importance of raw materials for society, the challenges related to their supply within the EU and about proposed solutions which could help to improve society's acceptance of and trust in sustainable raw materials production in the EU, duly taking into account the applicable EU environmental legislation.
All actions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain, and consider standardisation aspects when relevant.
All proposals should justify the relevance of the selected pilot demonstrations in different locations within the EU (and also outside if there is a clear added value for the EU economy, industry and society).
All proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans (with indicated CAPEX, OPEX, IRR and NPV[3]) with clarified management of intellectual property rights, and commitment to the first exploitation.
In support of the EIP on Raw Materials actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task, and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
Actions should address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Integrated exploration solutions (2019): Actions should develop and demonstrate integrated exploration solutions focused on finding new deep land deposits. They could benefit from any of the advanced geological-geochemical-geophysical-remote sensing integrated (and multi-method) approaches, 3D and 4D modelling, automation and robotisation. Solutions should cover and be tested in both green and brown field mining sites.
b) Services and products for the extractive industries life cycle (2019): Actions should develop services and products based on Earth observation data and techniques and GNSS services for the extractive industries life cycle. The services and products should be built upon information and data made available by the Copernicus Programme, and other relevant Earth observation and proximal sensing data. Use of data made available by EGNOS (and in the long term, Galileo) or other relevant Earth GNSS data should be considered where relevant. Services should be developed and tested for any of the different phases of the mining life cycle: exploration, extraction, closure or post closure. Particular attention should be given to services for environmental monitoring (including metals dispersion) and safety and security monitoring associated with open pits (slopes stability/landslides risk), underground mining (e.g. subsidence) and mining waste disposal (e.g. tailings dams and dumps). Services to be developed should include the design and testing of early warning systems and associated monitoring plans to prevent and mitigate risks associated with extraction and mining waste disposal[4].
c) Mining pilots (2020): Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative mining systems to avoid exposure of workers in dangerous operations, to increase efficiency, selectivity and profitability of the mining operations, to minimise environmental impacts during the mining life cycle, to improve social acceptance and trust in the innovative solutions, The actions should develop a plan to communicate to policy makers on alignment of public policies with emerging innovative mining systems. Any of the metallic, industrials and/or construction minerals could be targeted. However, the importance of the targeted raw materials for the EU economy has to be duly demonstrated in the proposal.
d) Pilots on substitution of critical and scarce raw materials (2020): Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative and sustainable solutions for the appropriate substitution of critical and/or scarce raw materials use in applications related to any of the high tech sectors, such as the low-carbon renewable energy, electric and electronic, mobility sectors, etc. Actions should build on existing research and aim at scaling-up and market uptake of the most promising solutions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 million and EUR 13 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The outreach and opening of the Water JPI to third country partners is increasingly raising interest among the latter. Building on this momentum, the challenge is to further enhance the opening of the Water JPI to international cooperation and thus contribute to creating a coherent European Research Area that is open to international cooperation in the area of water – a global research and innovation challenge par excellence. In addition, it is foreseen that this topic would consolidate the alignment of national, EU and international water research and innovation programmes, which is one of the key objectives of Joint Programming Initiatives. Finally, there is a need to support the post-2015 global goal for water, building on related international activities taking place at United Nations level.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to create a framework and permanent dialogue to encourage the opening in a structured and strategic manner of the Water JPI to international cooperation with key international water research and innovation programmes and funding and investment institutions. Proposals should also investigate activities to align with and support the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, in particular the Sustainable Development Goal on water and its impact on other goals, such as nutrition, education, health, etc. Flagship actions for possible joint funding between the members of the JPI Water, international cooperation partners and international programmes of strategic importance for the EU should be identified and prepared for.
This action should also organise and develop the knowledge base required to address water challenges and EU policy priorities within a global perspective. This can be accomplished through access to an integrated analysis of research results and recommendations arising from national and EU funded research and innovation projects in the area of water research and innovation. The ultimate result would be more efficient knowledge transfer, wider dissemination and take-up of research findings both in terms of policy and innovation. In addition, it would strengthen links with relevant water sectors and the Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform.
The Commission considers that proposals with a duration of five years requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to contribute to:
increasing the scale and ambition of water research and innovation activities beyond the level that would otherwise be sustainable, increasing the overall coherence and efficiency of the use of European resources and valorising European know-how on water solutions at global level in the context of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda;
making the Water JPI, in collaboration with the European Commission, a privileged and attractive partner for global cooperation in research and innovation, notably in the context of the Belmont Forum;
a strengthened role of the Water JPI for underpinning knowledge and evidence for supporting the implementation of related EU policies and for fostering the EU's position in global water-related negotiations and fora.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders and the promotion of coherent and effective cooperation with third countries is excluded from the delegation to EASME and will be implemented by the Commission services.

Specific Challenge: The pace of current developments and uncertainties surrounding likely future trends in ecosystems and their services requires further steps to maintain and strengthen the evidence base to ensure that policy makers, businesses and citizens in the EU and Associated Countries can continue to draw on a sound understanding of the state of natural resources and the wider environment, the possible impact of response options and their consequences in social, economic and environmental terms.
Better coordination of often fragmented research and innovation actions within Europe and beyond is needed, accompanied by timely and open exchange of information and research results to enhance the impact of research and ensure a more efficient use of resources and scientific developments.
Innovative ways are required to mobilise all relevant actors, increase policy coherence, resolve trade-offs, manage conflicting interests, increase participation of citizens in decision-making and improve public awareness and business uptake of research results.
Scope: Creation of European networks to facilitate dialogue among the relevant scientific communities, funding bodies and user communities in Europe throughout the duration of Horizon 2020. Proposals should cover activities such as clustering, coordinating and creating synergies between international, European and nationally funded research and innovation actions, developing joint programmes and projects, creating links with related international programmes, forward looking analysis to establish emerging needs, communication and dissemination activities for an improved science-policy interface, and aligning research with decision-making requirements. This requires cross-disciplinary interaction and an integrated, systemic approach, especially between socio-economic and environmental sciences.
Proposals shall address the following issue:
Structuring research on soil, land-use and land management in Europe: a network of funding agencies and other key players in Europe (and possibly beyond) to scope national funded research activities, develop a joint vision and design a strategic research agenda (SRA) for activities on soil, land-use and land management that should be implemented through future joint calls. Examples of relevant issues are: land-use change impacts and trends, including the ones related to bioenergy/bioeconomy resources, spatial planning, soil threats, sustainable use of the soil-sediment-water system, impacts at global level and effects on trading partners, integrating socio-economic research and identifying elements linking to relevant policy domains and multilateral environmental agreements.
Expected impact: Evidence-based policy and appropriate, cost-effective management, planning and adaptation decisions by the public sector, businesses, industry and society through the provision and effective communication of trustworthy and timely science-based information. Enhanced impact of research and innovation activities through better identification of R&I priorities, improved coordination of EU and Member State/Associated Country research and innovation programmes and funded activities, and synergies with international research and innovation programmes.
In addition, the following specific impacts are expected:
In the short-term establish a jointly agreed vision and SRA and a network of funding agencies determined to implement it through a joint call in a follow-up phase. Enhance synergies and collaboration between national research programmes in the domain. Medium to long-term, improved evidence-based policy making in domains such as agriculture, environment, climate action, spatial planning, energy transition, drinking water production, resource efficiency and cohesion, and for implementing the Rio+20 pledge to achieve a 'land-degradation neutral' world.

Specific challenge: The EU is highly dependent on imports of raw materials that are crucial for a strong European industrial base, an essential building block of the EU's growth and competitiveness. However, Europe is confronted with a number of challenges along the entire raw materials value chain, starting with exploration, to secure a sustainable access to raw materials, including Critical Raw Materials (CRM).
The major challenges are the geological uncertainty, technological and economic feasibility of mine development, and high and growing costs for exploration. In Europe, additional challenges include difficult operation in densely populated areas (access to land) and the fact that the majority of new deposits in Europe will be found at greater depths or in extreme environments such as the Arctic and the oceans.
Europe is also facing the fact that it has been actively mined over many centuries so easy-to-access mineral deposits are mostly exhausted, and exploration activity in the past decades was too low to enable the identification of a sufficient amount of new resources. The major opportunities to access the fresh raw materials within the EU are in greater depths or in smaller deposits where larger mining operations may not be feasible.
In the processing step, the available primary and secondary raw materials feeds are becoming more complex and low grade, and they may also vary in composition over time and contain different size of particles from coarse to very fine grains. Efficient processing requires a series of complex and integrated solutions leading to high investment installations, that will only be economically viable when operating at certain size (economy of scale) and for a predictably-sufficient long time taking into consideration volatility of metal prices. The production process also faces challenges related to water and sediment pollution, atmospheric dispersion, transport and deposition of toxic particles, noise, transport of ores etc.
This specific challenge is identified in the Priority Area 'Technologies for primary and secondary raw materials’ production of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope: Proposals shall address the following issues. All proposals should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially-driven multidisciplinary consortia.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Related environmental and safety risks should be assessed for all proposed actions.
Proposals should develop solutions, proving concept and feasibility at the level of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4-6; please see part G of the General Annex.
Mining of small and complex deposits and alternative mining
Proposals should develop new sustainable concepts and technological solutions, including alternative approaches, for mining of small, complex or difficult to access mineral deposits, including mining wastes and abandoned mining sites, particularly addressing the challenges of accessibility, industrial viability and environmental impacts. Proposals should include the participation of SMEs, as far as possible.
Expected impact: In the longer term pushing the EU to the forefront in the areas of sustainable exploration, mining and processing technologies and solutions. Improved competitiveness and creation of added value and new jobs in materials producing and downstream industries. Unlocking a substantial volume of various raw materials within the EU. In the short to medium term enabling the better efficiency of exploitation of raw materials’ resources and increasing the range and yields of recovered raw materials. Reduced exploration costs for the industry through new cost-effective exploration technologies. Improved competitiveness and creation of numerous new jobs in mining and equipment manufacturing industries. Improved economic viability and investment security of mining operations.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Rapid demographic, socio-economic, and climate changes are threatening the sustainable development of the Mediterranean region, especially the capacity of its agriculture to cope with increased demand for food production in a scenario of water scarcity and increasing competition for water use between different sectors. To address this challenge, it is recognised that a significant and well-coordinated research effort at regional scale is needed to find innovative solutions to sustainable food production and water use. In its recent conclusions on a partnership for research and innovation in the Mediterranean area, the EU Council recalled the importance of creating a stable long-term and sustainable framework to deal with these challenges, based on the principles of co-ownership, integration, mutual benefit and shared benefit between both shores of the Mediterranean basin. To ensure a long term commitment from the participating countries in a well-structured and integrated partnership, it is necessary to prepare the ground by integrating various related on-going joint programming activities on food and water into a large scale coherent programme with well-defined objectives and implementation actions.
Scope:
The objective of this action is to bring together the main national research funding owners and/or managers involved in the PRIMA joint programming process, including the non-European participating states and their institutions, around a jointly designed Strategic Research Agenda with appropriate governance and implementation structures. A critical mass of players and increased synergies between all relevant stakeholders (e.g. relevant ministries responsible for sustainable agricultural production systems and water resources management, research institutions and universities, farmers' organisations) will be key elements for addressing the challenge.
In agreement with the Commission services, projects should ensure appropriate flexibility so as to respond in real time to potentially fast-changing policy scenarios.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to contribute to:
reinforced cooperation and coordination of food systems and water research programmes within a long term partnership involving research funding bodies, universities, ministries or any other stakeholders from the two sides of the Mediterranean area;
reducing fragmentation of efforts and enhance a collective ownership;
facilitating consultation, awareness and commitment;
supporting structural, long-lasting progress toward sustainable economic and social development in the Mediterranean;
unlocking the innovation potential of participating countries in water management and use for food security;
optimising the launch and implementation of a long term partnership, ensuring an appropriate funding from the participating countries and leverage effect.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders and the promotion of coherent and effective cooperation with third countries is excluded from the delegation to EASME and will be implemented by the Commission services.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU is highly dependent on raw materials that are crucial for a strong European industrial base, an essential building block of the EU's growth and competitiveness. Securing the sustainable access to raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals and construction raw materials, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRM), for the EU economy is of high importance. However, the EU is confronted with a number of technological challenges along the entire raw materials production value chain of primary and secondary raw materials. There is also a need for clean and sustainable raw materials production solutions to avoid environmental damage.
This specific challenge is identified in the Priority Area 'Technologies for primary and secondary raw materials’ production of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope:
All proposals should develop sustainable systemic solutions through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain of non-energy non-agricultural raw materials.
Assessment of the related environmental, social and safety risks and a plan to communicate the added value of the proposal to the local communities and society for improving public acceptance and trust should be addressed by all the proposals. Participation of civil society from the start of exploration until after-mining activities in a process of co-design, co-development and co-implementation is strongly encouraged.
Projects should include a work-package to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020, in support of the EIP on Raw Materials.
In line with the EU's strategy for international co-operation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497) international co-operation is encouraged.
Proposals should develop solutions validated in lab or in industrially relevant environment, finishing at the level of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4-5.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 million and EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals shall address only one of the following issues:
a) Sustainable selective low impact mining (2016): Proposals should develop new sustainable selective low impact technological solutions for mining of small mineral deposits (including those with chemically complex ore-forming phases) on the land. The proposals have to clearly show integration of mining solutions with the processing and/or metallurgy steps in order to justify economic viability of the overall process. Proposals should include the participation of technology oriented SMEs, as far as possible.
b) New technologies for the enhanced recovery of by-products (2016): Proposals should evaluate the potential by-products existing in primary or secondary raw materials (usually accompanying the major constituents at low concentrations) and should develop energy-, material- and cost-efficient new mineral processing and/or metallurgical technologies and processes to increase the selectivity and the recovery rates of valuable by-products, particularly Critical Raw Materials. The importance of the targeted sources of by-products for the EU economy has to be duly demonstrated in the proposal.
c) New sensitive exploration technologies (2017): Proposals should develop new and more sensitive environmentally sound exploration technologies and solutions (such as remote sensing technologies, innovative multi-method approaches to reprocess existing or new geophysical data) able to identify targets for detailed exploration on the land with lower costs, leading to finding new deposits and to re-assessing the mineral potential for the EU. Any of the metallic, industrial and/or construction minerals could be targeted. The importance of the targeted raw materials for the EU economy has to be duly demonstrated in the proposal. Proposals should include the participation of technology oriented SMEs, as far as possible. Sea exploration is not targeted by this call.

Specific Challenge: The appropriate and sustainable supply of raw materials requires  framework conditions which relate to mineral policies, permitting procedure and data reporting system, raw materials knowledge infrastructure, research and innovation coordination, and international cooperation. Mineral policies are sometimes not clear, too dispersed in their implementation or insufficiently linked to other related policies (e.g. land-use planning and management) to be fully effective. A common understanding of which mineral deposits are of public importance is lacking. Permitting procedures can be lengthy and sometimes conflict with other public authorities’ requirements. Knowledge of raw materials reserves and resources is dispersed, terminology is often heterogeneous and reporting standards vary throughout the Member States. There is no raw materials knowledge infrastructure at EU level.
Research and development in the area of raw materials is scattered between different players. Further coordination is required between industrial players, researchers in the EU and across the whole value chain and EU and Member State funding authorities. There is a need to better exploit synergies in R&D with the best world players in raw materials technology and scientific developments, as well as to learn from the experience of raw materials-producing countries.
These specific challenges are identified in the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals shall address the following issue:
Mineral deposits of public importance: developing a concept and methodology for defining and protecting the mineral deposits of public importance with an adequate regulatory (including permitting) or guidance framework similar to NATURA 2000 in order to ensure the best use of the mineral deposits of public importance in the future. It should develop an appropriate mapping framework with the detailed definition and qualifying conditions of the concept of mineral deposits of public importance, covering all minerals with stress on the occurrence of critical minerals and defining deposits of local, regional, national or EU interest and importance and their safeguarding. It should also examine how to incorporate the concept into the national and regional minerals policies as well as in land use planning policies of different scales through  different policy scenarios and their impacts, and test the methodology on several areas and scales for ensuring robustness at all scales (local, regional, national and EU) and transferability across Member States. The proposal shall engage all relevant actors across the EU from local, regional, national to EU levels, including civil society, relevant representatives of public administration and experts on mineral deposits, land use and development planning, mining and related legislation (particularly permitting), and the relevant industries.
Expected impact: In the medium to longer term enhanced impact of research and innovation activities through better identification of R&I priorities, improved co-ordination of EU and Member States' research and innovation programmes and funded activities, and synergies with international research and innovation programmes. Greater EU influence in multilateral processes and better support to implementation of international commitments. Contribution to evidence-based policy and appropriate, cost-effective management, planning and adaptation decisions by the public sector, businesses, industry and society addressing global challenges in the EU and beyond through the provision and effective communication of trustworthy science-based information. Establishing and maintaining strong and sustainable relationships with the countries concerned. Improved conditions for sustainable access and supply of raw materials in the EU. Facilitated decision-making at EU, national, regional and local levels and in the minerals industry. Safeguarding of mineral wealth for future generations by defining mineral deposits of public importance. Stable and competitive supply of raw materials from EU sources. Promotion of good governance and facilitation of public acceptance in the EU. Increased competitiveness of the EU industry and minerals supply from EU sources.

","06 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
The EU is highly dependent on raw materials that are crucial for a strong European industrial base, an essential building block of the EU's growth and competitiveness. Securing the sustainable access to raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals and construction raw materials, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRM), for the EU economy is of high importance.
The challenge for industry is to scale-up promising raw materials production technologies and to demonstrate that raw materials can be produced in an innovative and sustainable way in order to make sure that research and innovation end-up on the market, to strengthen the competitiveness of the European raw materials industries, to meet ambitious energy and climate 2030 targets and to gain the trust of the EU citizens to raw materials sector.
This specific challenge is addressing development of the ""innovative pilot actions""[1] which is one of the major targets of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope:
The main objective is to develop innovative pilots demonstrating clean and sustainable production of non-energy non-agricultural raw materials in the EU from primary and/or secondary sources.
All proposals should cover all the following points:
justify relevance of selected pilot demonstrations, finishing at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-8, in different locations within the EU (and also outside if there is a clear added value for the EU economy, industry and society);
facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain;
include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans (with indicated CAPEX, OPEX, IRR and NPV[2]) with clarified management of Intellectual Property Rights, and commitment to the first exploitation;
consider standardisation aspects when relevant;
assess health, safety and environmental risks and their management for all proposed actions to avoid environmental damage and maintain overall environmental stability;
include a plan to communicate the added value of the proposal to the local communities and society for improving public acceptance and trust should be addressed by all the proposals. Participation of civil society from the start of exploration until after-closure activities in a process of co-design, co-development and co-implementation is strongly encouraged.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national/regional research and innovation programmes.
Within the projects funded, additional or follow-up funding should be sought, be it private or public, including from relevant regional/national schemes under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), in particular under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), or other relevant funds such as the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II). To achieve this, projects could seek contact with ERDF/IPA managing authorities and with the authorities who developed the Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies (RIS3). The responsible regional/national authorities could then take an interest in the projects and their expected results. They could engage in the use and deployment of the novel solutions resulting from projects e.g. through pre-commercial public procurement or public procurement for innovative solutions. The project proposals could already indicate which interested regions/countries or other partners have been pre-identified for contact during the project. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.
Projects should include a work-package to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020, in support of the EIP on Raw Materials
In line with the EU's strategy for international co-operation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497) international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 million and EUR 13 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals shall address only one of the following issues:
a) Intelligent mining on land (2016): Proposals should develop and demonstrate new intelligent mining systems to avoid exposure of workers in dangerous operations, to increase efficiency and profitability, and to minimise environmental impacts of the mining operations. Any of the metallic, industrials and/or construction minerals could be targeted. The importance of the targeted raw materials for the EU economy has to be duly demonstrated in the proposal.
b) Processing of lower grade and/or complex primary and/or secondary raw materials in the most sustainable ways (2017): Proposals should demonstrate new systems integrating relevant processing and refining technologies for better recovery of minerals and metals from low grade and/or complex ores, industrial or mining wastes at increased efficiency in terms of better yield and process selectivity. The importance of the targeted raw materials and their sources for the EU has to be demonstrated in the proposal. The solution proposed should be flexible enough to adapt to different ore grades and should be supported by efficient and robust process control.
c) Sustainable metallurgical processes (2017): Proposals should develop innovative metallurgical systems integrating pyro-, hydro-, bio-, and/or electro-metallurgical and/or electrochemical technologies, in order to enhance the production efficiency, metal recovery and selectivity from primary and/or secondary raw materials.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to justify and provide evidence that they:
a)
contribute to achieving the targets of the EIP on Raw Materials, particularly in terms of innovative pilot actions on mining for innovative production of raw materials;
have a market potential and the competitive technology advantage that will be gained through the pilot leading to expanding the EU business and to be implemented across the EU after the project is finished;

Specific Challenge: The appropriate and sustainable supply of raw materials requires  framework conditions which relate to mineral policies, permitting procedure and data reporting system, raw materials knowledge infrastructure, research and innovation coordination, and international cooperation. Mineral policies are sometimes not clear, too dispersed in their implementation or insufficiently linked to other related policies (e.g. land-use planning) to be fully effective. A common understanding of which mineral deposits are of public importance is lacking. Permitting procedures can be lengthy and sometimes conflict with other public authorities’ requirements. Knowledge of raw materials reserves and resources is dispersed, terminology is often heterogeneous and reporting standards vary throughout the Member States. There is no raw materials knowledge infrastructure at EU level.
Research and development in the area of raw materials is scattered between different players. Further coordination is required between industrial players, researchers in the EU and across the whole value chain and EU and Member State funding authorities. There is a need to better exploit synergies in R&D with the best world players in raw materials technology and scientific developments, as well as to learn from the experience of raw materials-producing countries.
These specific challenges are identified in the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 to 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

When appropriate, mentoring, dissemination of best practices, analysis on related policy, regulations, trade and other relevant issues, involving the international community, should be incorporated. In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: In the medium to longer term enhanced impact of research and innovation activities through better identification of R&I priorities, improved co-ordination of EU and Member States' research and innovation programmes and funded activities, and synergies with international research and innovation programmes. Greater EU influence in multilateral processes and better support to implementation of international commitments. Contribution to evidence-based policy and appropriate, cost-effective management, planning and adaptation decisions by the public sector, businesses, industry and society addressing global challenges in the EU and beyond through the provision and effective communication of trustworthy science-based information. Establishing and maintaining strong and sustainable relationships with the countries concerned. Improved conditions for sustainable access and supply of raw materials in the EU. Facilitated decision-making at EU, national, regional and local levels and in the minerals industry.

Millions of Europeans receive high quality drinking water every day. However, the provision of safe water for drinking purposes is threatened by, amongst other factors, new and emerging pollutants. Many of them are used and released continuously in the aquatic environments (freshwaters, groundwater, marine) where they impact organisms, ecosystems and may end up in the human food chain.
Key knowledge gaps remain around the environmental behaviour of new and emerging pollutants, both in water resources and in the marine environment, and their impacts on ecosystem and human health. Moreover, most emerging pollutants are not properly regulated. Hence there is an urgent need to fill related knowledge gaps and strengthen our capacities to improve water, food and health security.
Research needs to be deployed in a number of scientific fields to improve the knowledge base on water resources availability and use and must be systematically combined with a socio-economic approach investigating the questions of adaptation strategies, participation, behaviour and commitment of stakeholders. To be more effective and increase the added value of related investments, the efforts and strategic research agendas of the many European funding networks and organisations need to be integrated to establish transnational and trans-disciplinary research and innovation actions.
Scope:
Risks posed to human health and the environment by pollutants and pathogens present in water resources (2019): Actions should support delivering on the priorities identified in the Strategic Research and Innovation Agendas (SRIAs) of the Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs) on Water, Anti-Microbial Resistance, and Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans, in particular the thematic areas 'Developing Safe Water Systems for Citizens' of the Water JPI SRIA (specifically the subtheme 'Understanding and predicting the environmental behaviour and effects of by-products, pollutants and pathogens, including their environmental effects'), and 'Interdisciplinary Research for Good Environmental Status' of the JPI Oceans SRIA. They should also support the implementation of EU water policy.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are requested to include additional joint calls without EU co-funding as well as other activities such as the establishment or consolidation of a pan-European network of funding agencies and other key players in Europe, building on previous experience and avoiding overlaps with other initiatives, support to mutual learning and training, exchange of good practice, researcher mobility and equal opportunities (e.g. through EURAXESS) and better careers in the field. Wherever relevant, actions should involve social sciences and humanities.
Participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries not listed in General Annex A are eligible for EU funding under this topic and may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) only for the coordination costs of additional activities. The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with related on-going actions co-funded by the EU under Horizon 2020.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
effective trans-national, pan-European research networking, exchange of good practices, synergy, coordination and coherence among national/regional and EU research programmes in the areas addressed;
improved evidence-based policy through the interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary science-policy interface and links with international efforts and fora on the areas addressed;
strengthened international leadership of European research in this area making the relevant JPIs, in collaboration with the European Commission, a privileged and attractive partner for global cooperation in research and innovation;
the implementation of the objectives of the JPIs on Water, AMR and Oceans;
reduced risks posed by emerging pollutants to waterbodies and related ecosystems and food chain, and reduced risks to human health via these ecosystems;
increased protection of human health through the provision of safe water;
alleviation of water challenges within and beyond Europe, particularly in urban areas.

","10 November 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
As part of its 2015 strategic targets GEO has agreed to achieve sustained operation, continuity and interoperability of the GEOSS information system that facilitates access to, and use of Earth observation resources made available by the global GEO community. However the evolution of the current GEOSS information system[1] indicates that in parallel to this overarching goal there is a need also to strengthen the access to Earth Observation at regional level so that it becomes easier to harvest, consolidate and exploit those data at global level. The specific challenge under this topic is therefore to overcome the fragmentation of the European landscape of existing public and private Earth observation data infrastructures and to maximise their combined exploitation in the light of the evolving demand and supply of Earth observations in Europe. In order to meet this challenge a European data hub of the GEOSS information system should be developed taking into account the global trend towards more open data policies, the availability of new big data technologies and the requirements for the development of the European digital economy. The main function for such a hub would consist in harvesting available resources from relevant GEOSS data infrastructures in Europe and in particular from the distributed Copernicus data infrastructures. Developing such a hub would allow maximising and leveraging on past Community investments to support the GEOSS Common Infrastructure, in particular the broker technology, developed in the framework of several FP7 research projects[2]. This would also help retain ownership in the evolution of this IT technology, which is at the cornerstone of the GEOSS.
Scope:
This action will develop a GEOSS European hub consisting of an innovative web-based IT platform to provide users with a unique access point (gateway) to the diverse European range of Earth observation data (space-based and in situ data, from research and operational data infrastructures, across disciplines and communities) and services, as well as other relevant data sources such as socio-economic related ones. This platform should cope in particular with requests from European users willing to discover, access, combine and process multiple Earth observation data and information streams. Full interoperability with the GEOSS Discovery and Access Broker, with GEOSS data hubs developed in other regions of the world, and with environmental infrastructures associated with major EU programmes, legislations and initiatives shall be ensured. This applies especially to the Copernicus programme[3], the EU Directives related to INSPIRE[4] and the reuse of public sector information[5], as well as to research infrastructures such as GEANT and the EU High Performance Computing facilities. The GEOSS European data hub should be built in close cooperation with other national and European initiatives, in particular with Copernicus. Special attention shall be given to user-friendliness for multiple user profiles while ensuring system adaptability, scalability and robustness. At international level, this action should also contribute to the Community Strategy and Implementation plan of the Belmont Forum e-Infrastructures and Data Management Collaborative Research Action[6].
The European hub shall be open to academia, the public sector and to the European private sector. Its core concepts of data federation and user customisation shall support an open ecosystem of services and business opportunities and build on past EU research investments in support of the GEOSS information system. Proposals should address the sustainability issue of this platform beyond the project lifetime and a governance model driven by the public sector with possible contributions from private entities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 9 million and EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
improved user-friendly discovery, access and exploitation of Earth observation data and information in Europe;
strengthened European regional approach to GEOSS;
broader uptake of GEOSS and Copernicus data, information and services;
increased Earth observation-driven innovation and business opportunities for European SMEs and companies;
wider commercial exploitation of Earth observation data and products beyond sectors that are not traditionally engaged in Earth observation;
increased European capacity to address GEOSS societal challenges of prime importance to the EU such as achieving the post-2015 sustainable development goals or implementing adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Biodiversity continues to decline in every region of the world, significantly affecting ecosystem services as well. More than ever, there is a need to enhance the capacity to monitor changes in natural capital, to better understand links between biodiversity loss and the drivers of change and the impact of the former on our society. Ongoing monitoring efforts are spatially and temporally fragmented and taxonomically biased. Key data sets are either not updated or are updated irregularly, so that long-term information is limited. On the other hand, many EU policies, action plans, programmes and initiatives (such as the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Biodiversity Strategy, or the 7th EAP) increasingly rely on the supply of harmonised and regularly updated biodiversity data, but EU initiatives to support the monitoring of components of EU biodiversity lack a comprehensive approach. As a result, the actual uptake and use of monitored biodiversity data in policy design, implementation and evaluation is still far too low.
The challenge is therefore to harness scientific advances and bring together various actors to strengthen current efforts and devise a structured and cost-effective EU-level approach to ecosystem monitoring combining in-situ, space and air-born monitoring.
Scope:
The action should design an EU-wide framework for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem services, which
integrates different reporting streams, data sources and monitoring activities at international, EU, national and regional level (including remote sensing, citizen science and citizens observatories);
is cost effective;
links to policy targets, indicators and assessments;
builds on best practices in EU Member States;
delivers timely data, which is comparable over time and across the EU Member States.
The action should provide scientific advice and practical analysis on the best EU-level monitoring approaches related to measuring the implementation of key EU ecosystem and biodiversity targets. This includes:
- an analysis of which parts of ecosystems and biodiversity are covered by established monitoring programmes or current initiatives (such as the Pollinators Initiative, the Bioeconomy strategy, etc) and what are the most important gaps;
- designing accurate and cost-effective techniques for establishing regular and comprehensive monitoring systems to fill these gaps (e.g. in-situ surveys, integration of satellite & ground observation data, use of new technologies, etc), and estimating their cost.
The action should play a coordination role, facilitating exchange and discussion between relevant actors, including national and EU level bodies, as well as organisations such as the EEA. It should contribute to a more comprehensive and long-term monitoring of EU ecosystems and biodiversity, building also on existing data collection programmes[1].
This work could also support/benefit from the EU’s contribution to international biodiversity agreements and initiatives, such as IPBES, GEO/GEOSS and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.
The action should also facilitate the work at Member State level to build the national data foundations needed for ecosystem assessment and accounting, by supporting the exchange of experience and by providing capacity building, technical support and workshops. The action is expected to work with KIP INCA partners, as well the EEA, to ensure long-term implementation of biodiversity and ecosystem services monitoring and support the data-related work of relevant EU-funded projects to facilitate the coherence and compatibility of their data and their integration into existing EU-level data bases. Proposals should explore potential synergies with previous and future actions funded under the EU research and innovation framework programmes and avoid duplication and overlaps.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
the implementation of the Bioeconomy Strategy, including the better use of Copernicus through calibrating with ground data;
the implementation of ecosystem-related EU policies, action plans, programmes and initiatives; in particular via the MAES and INCA processes;
scenarios, assessments and data in the context of initiatives, such as IPBES, GEO/GEOSS, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility or IPCC; and in EU initiatives on Nature-based Solutions or sustainable agriculture.
proposing EU-level monitoring approaches of key EU ecosystem and biodiversity targets (including recommendations on the most accurate and cost-effective techniques);

In order to secure sustainable supply of raw materials to the EU society, the raw materials sector needs to strengthen its performance and competitiveness through research and innovation. Stronger integration of national and regional R&I programmes across the whole EU is needed to tap the potential of available funding and to reach the critical mass pushing the EU raw materials sector to the forefront in the sustainable production of primary and secondary raw materials and substitution of critical or scarce raw materials.
Scope:
The objective of the ERA-NET is to strengthen co-ordination of national and regional research programmes in the field of non-energy non-agricultural raw materials, while building on the experience of previous ERA-NETs ERA-MIN and ERA-MIN 2. This should be achieved in line with the integrated strategy proposed in the EU Raw Materials Initiative (RMI) and the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials. The ERA-NET should cover the whole raw materials value chain including exploration, extraction and processing technologies and recycling, as well as substitution.

","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The EU policy and regulatory framework in the sectors of energy, transport and ICT supports the development of sectoral solutions, i.e. solutions with a limited degree of integration. However, for successful and accelerated implementation in real environments such as urban ones - that also have to take into account local specificities the test of integrated measures will pave the way for faster market roll-out of technologies. The key challenges for Smart Cities and Communities are to significantly increase the overall energy efficiency of cities, to exploit better the local resource both in terms of energy supply as well as through the demand side measures. This will imply the use of energy efficiency measures optimising at the level of districts, the use of renewables, the sustainability of urban transport and the needed drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas - within economically acceptable conditions - while ensuring for citizens better life conditions: lower energy bills, swifter transport, job creation and as a consequence a higher degree of resilience to climate impacts (e.g. urban heat islands effects) etc.
Scope:To identify, develop and deploy replicable, balanced and integrated solutions in the energy, transport, and ICT actions through partnerships between municipalities and industries.
These solutions at the intersection of the three sectors will have a holistic approach and are still facing first mover risk. These will be the lighthouse projects as identified by the Communication on Smart Cities and Communities. Lighthouse projects will target primarily large scale demonstration of replicable SCC concepts in city context where existing technologies or very near to market technologies (TRL 7 and more, see part G of the General Annexes) will be integrated in an innovative way.
The proposals should address the following main areas:
         (Nearly zero) or low energy districts: through the integration and management of: i) the supply of energy with predominant exploitation of local resources (e.g. waste heat, renewables, storage) and the active participation of consumers (e.g. use of aggregators); ii) the cost-effective refurbishment of existing buildings without significant disruption for tenants (use of sustainable materials) with a special focus on residential buildings  iii) the cross-cutting ICT solutions for the design and overall management of energy/ transport systems  
         Integrated Infrastructures: through the integration of physical infrastructures such as core networks, street scenes, lighting, industrial sites etc to create new forms of value through re-use and repurposing. This should lead to quantifiable benefits such as reduction of capital /operational expenditure as well as reduced carbon / energy footprints. This might also imply exploitation of synergies between requirements for smart grids, broadband infrastructures and in general poly networks (eg district heating and cooling).
         Sustainable urban mobility: through the integration of energy/ fuelling infrastructure with vehicle fleets powered by alternative energy carriers for public and private transport, including logistics and freight-distribution. Implications on energy management, and in the case of electromobility, the impact on the electricity grid, of the deployment of high numbers of vehicles and/or the alternative fuel blends performance must be assessed. 
The proposed proposals should address in addition to the main areas presented above a strategy that addresses appropriate enabler actions to support the commercial exploitation of the proposal. This includes (indicative list): commitment of authorities (even if changes of politicians/ majority, in the course of the project); citizens' engagement and empowerment; optimising policy and regulatory frameworks; open, consistent data and performance measurements; dissemination and unlocking the market potentials worldwide.
According to the Communication on Smart Cities and Communities the light house projects should look for creating partnerships between industries, academics and cities, empower citizens and ensure the replicability of the solutions, ensure the funding from various sources[1].
Therefore each project should:
Be realised in 2 – 3 cities or communities (light house cities or communities);
include industry, city planning authorities which should also reflect the view of the consumer organisations, research community, local Small and Medium Size Companies (SMEs);
In addition each project should co-involve 2 - 3 follower cities i.e. cities willing to contribute to the process though the replication of solutions at the end of the project and having access to the knowhow and results of the project and a privileged contact with the project's partners. The involvement of the follower cities should be relevant (e.g. participating in definition of user requirements and methodology of transferability of solutions, data collection etc.).  The follower cities should aim at improving their energy performance or the share of use of renewables (e.g. 60% reduction of primary energy for buildings, 20 - 30 % RES use for electricity as well as for heating and cooling). EU geographical coverage conditions should be also applied.
Ensure that all proposed activities are a part of ambitious urban plan. These activities should also lead to the development of integrated urban plans. For the lighthouse cities or communities these plans should be finalised (e.g. those compiled for the Covenant of Mayors, Sustainable Energy Action Plans, plans committed under the Green Digital Charter etc., but without limiting to this list of initiatives). The urban plan shall integrate buildings planning, energy networks, ICT, transport/mobility planning; additional issues may be addressed as well if relevant for the city. These plans shall be submitted with the proposal as a supporting document(s).
In order to ensure the success of the lighthouse projects, the funding for the other parts of the programme or initiative in which the lighthouse projects are embedded should be secured from other sources, preferably private ones, but also other EU funding sources (European Structural and Investment (ESI) funds for example), national or regional funding.
Projects should demonstrate and validate attractive business plans that allow large scale replication of fast economic recovery in cities of varying degrees of economic conditions (from very poor to very rich), varying sizes but significant urban areas  and varying climatic conditions to ensure high impact and replication potential .
The industrial partners and municipality authorities should engage in replicating successful demonstration in their own and other cities, notably 'follower cities'; the replication plans are compulsory and are part of the evaluation.
Consortia must have a clearly defined structure with roles and responsibilities properly spelled out for all involved entities.
Besides economic sustainability, proposals must also commit to scientific and technical requirements in support to reliability:
Open and consistent data and interoperability of solutions in order to avoid locked –in customers.
Contribution to common data collection systems (e.g. as those developed by European Commission under SCC2 of this Work Programme), measurement and disclosure methodology, in order to facilitate a common footprint calculation methodology and other metrics (especially for energy saving; CO2 reductions, financial savings, number of jobs created, environmental impact etc.).
The performance monitoring should last for a period of at least 2 years. Longer term commitment (e.g. 5 years) will give an added value to the proposal. Consortia should develop an integrated protocol for monitoring energy, infrastructure, mobility and governance practices in the lighthouse projects, enabling documentation of improved performance over short and long term periods. The monitoring protocol should be robust and viable also after the end of the project, supporting and increasing municipal capacity over time Participants may be asked to introduce performance data into existing data bases (CONCERTO technical monitoring data base).
""The grant will be composed of a combination of the reimbursement of eligible costs, and flat rate financing determined on the basis of unit costs only for the building-related demonstration activities. For more detail on the calculation method please refer to the document under the following link, article 6.2 of the document: http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/amga/h2020-amga_en.pdf ""
The building components of the proposals will be supported through the unit cost/m⊃2;.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 18 to 25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposals are expected to have the impacts described below:
deploy wide-scale, innovative replicable and integrated solutions in the energy, transport, and ICT;
trigger large scale economic investments with the repayment of implementation costs in acceptable time lines (to facilitate the bankability of the projects);
increase the  energy efficiency of districts and of cities and foster the use of renewables and their integration energy system and enable active participation of consumers;
increase mobility efficiency with lower emissions of pollutants and CO2;
reduce the energy costs;
decarbonise the energy system while making it more secure and stable;
create stronger links between cities in Member States with various geographical and economical positions through active cooperation.
It is envisaged that the proposals will also bring societal benefits:
reduction of energy bills for all actors and especially for citizens and public authorities;
Increase quality of life by creating  local jobs (that cannot be delocalised) in cities;
Increase air quality.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Scope:These networks should aim at networking public procurement bodies in order to establish ""buyers' groups"" for innovative smart city solutions that improve the potential impact of the investment for cities and their citizens, and improve framework conditions for innovation. These networks will help public procurers to increase their capacity to undertake a better coordinated and articulated dialogue with suppliers about future needs by exchanging experience in procurement practices and strategies and by undertaking joint or coordinated actions. The networks must have core set of deliverables (additional actions can also be proposed):
identifying procurement around a common need by European cities for which goods and services at the intersection of  ICT, energy and transport in urban areas are bought as investment;
prepare a number of formats/scenarios for possible future joint procurements; assessing the state-of-the art of potentially available solutions by developing different approaches for ""market consultations"" involving the supply chain (paying special attention to SMEs and locally-based businesses);
carrying out legal work to ensure that the procurement of innovative solutions complies with European and national law;
improving procurement capabilities by joint trainings, workshops and other networking activities.
It is envisaged that there will be a fairly small consortia (about 10 organisations) that will form the core consortium of public procurers and these will commit to organise dissemination activities for a larger group of public procurers in order to spread the findings in all EU Member States.
The members of the consortia must be public procurers, i.e. contracting authorities in the meaning of the public procurement Directives at all levels (local, regional, national and supra-national) that plan to establish implementation plans for improving the quality and efficiency of their public service offering by procurement of innovative solutions for use in cities and communities. This includes both contracting authorities in the meaning of the public procurement directive for public authorities (2004/18/EC) and utilities (2004/17/EC), for example public transport operators, relevant ministries, utilities, communes and cities, police or fire brigades, e-government administrations etc.
The list of deliverables should include, among others, an analysis of procurement examples  already executed in EU Member States; an assessment of the most suitable cases for cross-border action; a set of generic draft procurements ready for adaptation to the particularities of the EU cities; an economic analysis on the benefits of simultaneous procurement from different cities. Work will also include the drafting of reports as well as dissemination activities to make these reports available to all interested parties.
This action will cross-fertilise and cooperate with actions under topic SCC 1 – 2014/2015.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.1 to 0.15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The project should mainly
      boost the market demand for smart city solutions by increasing consumer awareness about technologies and processes used in implementing smart city solutions.
      act as lever through procurement and investment planning tools for local administrations and business, a
      create better public acceptance and engagement.
      ensure  the framework conditions for the participating organisations for organising joint, cross-border public procurements
      encourage the public procurement bodies active in cities and communities through networks' activities, to increasingly become ""launch customers"" for innovative smart solutions which are not yet available on a large-scale commercial basis and which may entail a higher risk than purchasing products that are already commercially widely available.

In a globalised world, cities all over the world are facing broadly similar challenges. Finding solutions and defining optimal pathways towards sustainable urbanisation receives high priority in the Research and Innovation (R&I) policy of the majority of the countries worldwide. In this context, aligning R&I agendas to underpin sustainable urbanisation and implementing them through international collaboration will promote synergies, and thus an optimal use of the available expertise, capacity and resources, avoid duplication and ensure robust outcomes of global relevance. The opening of JPI Urban Europe to third country partners is increasingly finding interest among its members and among third countries. The Belmont Forum provides an excellent platform for international collaboration in the area of sustainable urbanisation.

Participation of legal entities from international partner countries and/or regions, in particular with countries participating in the Belmont Forum, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding[1] may nonetheless request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) for the co-ordination costs of additional activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to lead to:
the alignment of research and innovation agendas in the area of sustainable urbanisation and co-ordinated streamlining of the implementation of the respective calls;
enhanced excellence and global relevance of research and innovation activities on sustainable urbanisation and increased visibility at international level;
strong and lasting alliance with the funding agencies of key international partners for research and innovation actions on sustainable urbanisation (e.g China, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, USA etc.);
linking of possible European and international demonstration actions on re-naturing cities to induce a wider, worldwide application of nature-based solutions.

","08 December 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To demonstrate solutions at district scale integrating smart homes and buildings, smart grids (electricity, district heating, telecom, water, etc.), energy storage, electric vehicles and smart charging infrastructures as well as latest generation ICT platforms which must be based on open specifications. This should be accompanied by energy efficiency measures and the use of very high shares of renewables at the level of districts. The goal is to facilitate a successful transformation towards intelligent, user-driven and demand-oriented city infrastructures and services.
Scope:
Lighthouse cities develop and test integrated innovative solutions at district scale. These lighthouse cities should act as exemplars for their region helping to plan the replication of these solutions, adapted to different local conditions.. Links with the broader Sustainable and Integrated Urban Development Strategies in the framework of the European Structural and Investment Funds should be sought as well as the funds available for the upscaling and replication of the projects (in particular ESIF).
A city can be funded as a lighthouse city only once under Horizon2020.
Technologies must be at least ""very near-to-market"" (technological readiness levels TRL 7 and more, see part G of the General Annexes). The innovation is in the combination of these technologies.
It is compulsory to develop and test innovative business models that enable deployment at large scale at different locations during the execution of the project.
An important focus of this call is on replication of solutions: Follower cities are cities that have yet to acquire the technical competence to become a lighthouse city. However, they shall be fully involved in the project from the beginning and commit sufficient resources within the project to deliver a business model that allows the financing of an ambitious replication of most of the solutions developed within the project and deliver it within a few years of the project's end (perhaps using ESIF). Proof of long term commitment of follower cities to replicate validated solutions as well as measures for active knowledge transfer (e.g. active mentoring or staff exchange between cities) will be evaluated.
It is essential that proposals cover all of the following aspects (the coverage of these aspects will be evaluated under the ‘Impact’ criterion):
Districts of buildings – old or new or mixed and ideally nearly zero or low energy – that should be chosen in relation to the size of the respective city and the local conditions and should guarantee high positive impact of the project. Each building in such a district shall become smart, more efficient, reliable and well integrated in the energy system of the district. It should feature latest generation ICT, smart meters, smart appliances, smart energy management, smart use of the thermal mass; smart management of cooling (where applicable) etc. and capitalize also on synergies between these single components. These smart buildings shall be integrated to form a smart district with intensive interaction between the buildings for increased synergies and eventually increased efficiency and decreased costs.
Smart interaction and smart management of different energy systems (electricity, heat, cold, gas or other grid systems (including water)) at district level and going far beyond classical electricity grids management only (e.g. smart solutions for storage including the intelligent use of the thermal mass of buildings that exploit synergies between these urban grids in order to increase efficiency and reduce energy costs).
Integration with and/or consolidation of low carbon ICT systems at district level.
Electromobility (in line with Directive 2014/94): smart electrical vehicle (EV) charging (grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid) while ensuring a positive impact on the whole energy system from a technical and economic point of view. The impact of the deployment of EV on locally weak or old grids must be assessed during the project.
Include partners from industry, public authorities, research communities and small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is essential that all lighthouse cities cover all of the following aspects (the coverage of these aspects will be evaluated under the ‘Impact’ criterion):
Significantly improve energy efficiency: Innovative integration of existing buildings with new buildings (especially in areas of mixed use such as university campuses, innovation districts, etc.). Proposals shall group energy efficiency measures by buildings or group of similar buildings in the BEST tables (available at the participant portal).
Incorporate renewable energy sources (RES) maximising the use of local resources (including waste heat, electricity and/or heat storage) and high shares of self-consumption. The active participation of consumers (e.g. use of aggregators) must be demonstrated.
Integrate electricity fuelling infrastructure for electric vehicle fleets. The impact of the deployment of high numbers of vehicles on the electricity grid must be assessed (costs of the recharging infrastructure and the vehicles are not eligible).
Use ICT solutions for improved planning management, control and maintenance of physical urban infrastructures and operational technologies in buildings, energy and transport, and that enable better services for individuals and businesses.
Prove interoperability between software modules to allow an effective management of components and information flows. To this end, and to ensure adaptability as new user requirements and technologies evolve, urban ICT platforms must be based on open specifications, including the data structures and application program interfaces (API). Concerns about security, privacy and confidentiality need to be addressed.
Develop innovative Business Models to demonstrate that both technical and financial risks are low enough for large scale investments in other EU cities with similar characteristics. Deployment plans for the lighthouse cities and quick replication in the follower cities and potentially other cities shall be submitted (and will be part of the evaluation).
Each project should:
Address concrete urban challenges identified by the respective urban authorities.
Have a performance monitoring which lasts for a period of at least 2 years during the project.
Develop a convincing replication and investment plan for each lighthouse city and each follower city that describes (a) what the partners in each city will do in order to ensure a large scale replication in their city after the successful end of the project and (b) where the funding will come from (in particular whether ESIF would be used). The initial investment plans (to be refined during the execution of the project) shall show that after successful demonstration private capital can take over further investments at low technical and financial risks so that the economically weakest regions and cities of all sizes become attractive for investors.
Have a consortium with clearly defined structure roles and responsibilities for all involved entities. The different actions in each city and between all cities (6 or more) must show excellent synergies. The added value of this cooperation versus each city alone must be clearly described.
Have a well-balanced geographical coverage between lighthouse and follower cities.
Commit to scientific and technical requirements to support reliability and sustainability: Open data and interoperability are necessary conditions to allow for ease of innovation for improved replicability and economies of scale, and so that solutions can be extended and lock-in of customers to specific solutions and/or vendors can be avoided.
Contribute to common long term data collection systems, measurement and disclosure methodology, in order to facilitate a common footprint calculation methodology and other metrics (especially for energy saving; CO2 reductions, financial savings, number of jobs created, environmental impact etc.).
Feature a work package for cooperation with other selected projects on main project issues including business models and legal, regulatory and other market barriers (foresee about 2 % to 3% of the requested funds for inter-project cooperation).
Incorporate all performance data into the Smart Cities Information System database (SCIS)[1] and cooperate with CITYKEYS, the support action selected in the 2014 call for performance measurement across sectors.
Use a robust and viable monitoring protocol, also valid after the end of the project so that future data can easily be introduced into the SCIS.
Each project must:
Be realised in 3 new lighthouse cities that are situated in different EU Member states or associated countries.
Involve at least 3 follower cities from at least 3 different EU Member states or associated countries (that are different also from the countries of the lighthouse cities of the project).
Each lighthouse city must:
Have Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), positively evaluated by the Covenant of Mayors (please attach proof in Annex) before submitting a proposal[2].
Non-eligible costs:
The costs of construction (including scale of unit costs), the costs of retrofitting (including scale of unit costs), the full cost of purchasing or leasing electric vehicles, the costs of acquisition of standard ICT tools, conventional RES and their mounting are not eligible. Insulation of the building envelope, good windows; heat pumps, and other appliances are not eligible costs.
Eligible costs:
Eligible costs cover all those innovative aspects that transform the city into a smart city, such as for example:
Integration of storage with all grids (across electricity, telecom, heating, cooling, gas, water, etc.).
Smart building management incorporating smart appliances, smart meters, domotics, of which only the smart/innovative part that is leading to a deep integration with the local energy system (electricity, telecom, heating and cooling, gas) is eligible.
Smart integration of the electricity grid with local RES (in and around the city), with electricity storage and heat storage (or cold storage for air conditioning or cooling or freezing, etc.) at the district level; the smart use of the existing thermal mass for better building management and the integration with energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is recommended and eligible.
Only the innovative parts of RES, suited for smart integration of PV modules, wind turbines, innovative integration of heat pumps or CHP combined with smart management of heat and electricity are eligible.
Economic research for and development of highly innovative approaches and testing of integrated business models that avoid lock-in situations and that lead to reduction of the energy bills for citizens.
Smart storage (electricity, heat or cold) and its management for maximising self-consumption is eligible.
ICT: only platforms based on open specifications with open application program interfaces (API), and that cater for data security and cyber-security are eligible.
Work on further refinements of the initially submitted replication plans and creating more ambitious targets during the project are eligible.
Training and education within and between cities is compulsory and thus eligible.
Including additional cities in the training and education (if the benefit is clearly stated) is eligible.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 12 to 18 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Each project shall significantly contribute to the impacts described below:
Put in practice a bankable solution for a challenge identified by the city;
Increase the energy efficiency on district scale;
Increase significantly the share of renewable energies, their integration into the energy system, stimulate self-consumption, reduce curtailment to the minimum;
Increase local air quality;
Reduce the technical and financial risks in order to give confidence to investors for investing in large scale replication
Make the local energy system more secure, more stable and cheaper for the citizens and public authorities;
Ensure the roll-out of electric vehicles in cities while containing the need for excessive upgrading of the electricity grid);
Reduce transport based CO2 emissions, on the basis of CO2 intensity of the European electricity grid of 540 CO2/kWh (coherent with TEST format - available on the Participant Portal);
Create stronger links and active cooperation between cities in a large number of Member States with a large coverage of cities with different size, geography, climatic zones and economical situations.

","Pre-Commercial Procurement
","01 March 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The broad range and the complexity of Common Security and Defence Policy civilians' missions make the management of information and of resources critical to decision-making, planning, optimizing for pre-deployment, and deploying capabilities within such missions, and essential to increase the efficiency, visibility and impact of the missions.
The processes, procedures, information systems, and equipment currently committed to such missions by the Member States need to be brought together and coordinated to constitute a common interoperable platform to enhance the EU capacity to play its role.
Scope:
This topic is to support the development of a cost-effective common Situational Awareness, Information Exchange and Operation Control Platform.
Cost-effectiveness, and shorter time to implement may result from adapting and exploiting existing approaches and experience in the defence sector, and leveraging from results from relevant projects formerly funded by the EU.
Taking into consideration the findings of the CSA under topic ""BES-11-2015: Information management topic 2: Information management, systems and infrastructure for civilian EU External Actions"" of the 2014-2015 Secure Societies Work Programme[1]
, activities must be structured along the following phases:
Phase 1: Plan the research and the design of the platform, based on common performance levels, requirements and associated specifications for the development of a cost-effective common situational awareness, information exchange and operation control platform for EU civilian external actions developed in BES-11-2015, to be published prior to the opening of the Call in the section ""Topic Conditions & Documents"" for this topic on the Participant Portal"".[1]
Plans must consider integrating existing technologies, data models and methodologies (including pooling and sharing of capabilities) according to design constraints expressed by the buyers, to ensure cost effectiveness and interoperability.
The results of phase 1 should lead to calls for tenders (for the procurement of R&D services) which focus on technologies clearly identified to be part of a unique architecture.
Phase 2: The research and specification work should lead to at least 2 versions of flexible platforms to support, each, several scenarios for EU actions under different framework conditions.
Phase 3: By the end of 2020, the project should have documented, tested, and validated the use of each platform in at least two operational scenarios within actual multinational operations. The participation of relevant and competent authorities in the consortium of buyers is a prerequisite.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going cooperation should be taken into account.
For grants awarded under this topic SEC-13–BES–2017, beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming to ensure exploitation of its results:
To ensure that the outcome of the PCP action becomes also available to EU Member State national authorities as well as EU agencies not participating in the PCP for further procurement purposes, the proposal must necessarily state:
(1). Agreement from participating procurement authorities to negotiate, in good faith and on a case-by-case basis, with non-participating procurement authorities that wish to procure a capability or a product fully or partly derived from the PCP action, the use of the information required to run such a procurement process, and solely for that purpose.
(2). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to consult with any legal entity generating information to be released for the purpose set out in paragraph (1), unless contrary to applicable legislation.
(3). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to negotiate the use granted under paragraph (1) on Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The respective option on additional exploitation obligations of Article 28.1 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 10million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
At least two prototype platforms deployed and tested in several, different real-life environments.
Medium term:
Better integration of existing systems and methodologies in situational awareness, information exchange and operation control platform prototypes.
Solid basis for a full-scale, cost-effective common situational awareness, information exchange and operation control platform for EU civilian external actions.
Long term:
Improved management of EU resources' allocated to EU civilian external actions.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Border management in European Union context means first and foremost the enforcement of the common policies and implementation of the common rules. As international travel flows continue to rise, there is growing pressure to process large volumes of people at border crossing points without delays. At the same time, the smuggling of people across the borders is growing. However, the external land borders of the European Union (and border crossing points) present a wide range of challenges, ranging from those relevant to Nordic Countries, to those in the Mediterranean.
The European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) is establishing a mechanism for Member States' authorities carrying out activities at the European Union external border to share operational and situational information and pictures. But without investments in technology and information systems, it is simply not feasible to manage borders and border crossing points. Whilst technology offers great potential to meet the dual objective of enhancing border security while facilitating cross-border travel, its costs are often prohibitive, especially in the light of the current national budgets. Furthermore, the broad variety of heterogeneous IT applications and systems deployed for land border security makes their management increasingly complex and costly. Innovative, cost-efficient technologies are needed, or existing ones need to become more affordable, to meet border authorities and practitioners’ requirements, and budgetary constraints.
Scope:
The cost of a broad variety of technologies could be made more affordable, in priority those used at border crossing points bearing the heaviest burden (based on the analysis of flows of people and of smuggling methods, associated risks, and bottlenecks in surveillance and/or control.)
The relevant border authorities are in the best position to identify the most relevant portions of the EU land borders that could benefit from more cost-effective solutions.
Cost reduction may result from: merging several advanced technologies into novel border security solutions; trade-off against performance; optimizing the use of technologies where they are most effective at mitigating risks further to specific risk analysis; achieving greater interoperability among systems; enabling the early provision of data in advance to the time of crossing.
The availability or scarcity of human resources and of space, the need for portable and versatile solutions are other parameters to be taken into account when considering the added value and cost of novel technologies solutions, including in terms of societal and ethical value and cost. In particular, the design of more homogeneous IT platforms, sharing an interface common to all operational databases and border security applications, is desirable to make their management less resource intensive.
Overlap with the work being undertaken by border surveillance authorities in the context of the EWISA project[1] should be avoided, whilst compatibility with previous results from FP7 or H2020 projects is encouraged.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going cooperation should be taken into account.
Proposers for this topic should look for an enhanced SME participation.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 5million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Short/Medium term:
Novel technologies, tools and systems (higher TRLs) demonstrating very substantial cost-reduction compared to existing technologies, tools and systems.
Cost-reduction shall be assessed through the comparative testing of technologies, tools and systems in quasi-operational scenarios. Cost vs. benefit analysis must take account of functional needs, conditions of use, maintenance costs, performance and quality, impact on operating procedures, impact on travellers, training requirements for new skills, etc.

Member States' authorities are carrying out activities all along the European border, and have started to share operational and situational information. But several regions at the borders of the European Union are covered with forests, and face extreme temperature conditions. Detecting, locating, tracking or identifying persons and vehicles crossing the border in forested regions is extremely difficult given that technologies for surveillance through harsh unstructured environments are currently not effective. The increasing risk of irregular flows and immigration across the border with, for instance, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia or Brazil makes the issue even more acute than in the past.
Scope:
Systems should be developed that combine or improve surveillance technologies and techniques and arrays of sensors of different sorts capable to provide higher quality detection capabilities and imaging via the integration of different techniques, to achieve wide- and small-area through foliage detection, despite the canopy density, in a real operational context. They could build on airborne, satellite-based, and/or on ground based platforms.
Solutions should be tested and validated in terms of capabilities to control effectively the land border covered by a vegetation layer, in all weather conditions.
Pre-competitive research may be needed to address various stages of development, from sensor design, to the analysis and design of system configuration and to the integration and validation by (public) authorities for target detection, identification and recognition.
Overlap with the work being undertaken by border surveillance authorities in the context of the EWISA[1] project should be avoided, whilst compatibility with previous results from FP7 or H2020 projects is encouraged. Ethical and societal acceptance needs to be properly addressed.

In coherence with the objectives of regulation No 1052/2013 establishing the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR), the EU Maritime Security Strategy Action Plan (EUMSS AP) advocates the ""strengthening of […] the information exchange to optimise the surveillance of the EU maritime area and its maritime borders"" and ""the improvement of the situational awareness and increase reaction capability at the external borders of the Member States of the Union for the purpose of detecting, preventing and combating illegal immigration and cross-border crime, and contributing to ensuring the protection and saving of lives of migrants"").
Large amounts of “raw” data are being collected nowadays, at unprecedented scale, coming from different sources, from different sorts of assets from different EU Member States, from the Internet and social networks, and gathered for different security purposes, in a variety of formats, are available but not necessarily exploitable because they are not accessible at the same time nor interoperable, until they are “fused” and made “understandable” to all systems supporting information exchange, situational awareness, and decision-making and reaction capability at the EU external maritime borders.
Scope:
Many detection systems are available to collect data that are useful for maritime security, coastal surveillance and beyond. The fusion of these data requires the development of methods and tools that take account of the technical characteristics of existing systems, and the specific context of all aspects of maritime security. As regards semantic interoperability, the CISE data model should be used to avoid the duplication of solutions.
""Fusion"" may refer to “intelligence correlation to produce higher level (or more accurate) information"". It may involve, inter alia:
mixing several homogeneous data to produce another data of superior quality;
pre-processing raw data and associating heterogeneous data, produced by different types of sensors, that refer to the same actual object or event, to produce information of superior quality;
overlapping surveillance pictures produced by different sources and generate a picture without redundant objects/tracks and allowing to deal with faulty sensors and data;
combining data acquired at different points in time through sensors (e.g. radars and camera) installed on the same platform or on different ones (underwater or surface vessels, drones or aircraft, satellite systems (including but not exclusively Copernicus, Galileo, and EGNOS);
combining offline with realtime data.
Data fusion techniques, complementing the existing information systems and sensor platforms, should help focusing the geographical zones to be monitored through the deployment of surveillance capabilities.
EU-funded R&D cooperative projects and EU Agencies have touched upon the issue. Data fusion may bear on, or generate information needing classification. Ethical and societal issues need to be properly addressed. Proposals need to build on existing results, focus on the remaining gaps and avoid duplication with previous endeavours.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission. Legal entities established in countries not listed in General Annex A and international organisations will be eligible for funding only when the Commission deems participation of the entity essential for carrying out the action.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going cooperation should be taken into account.

Effective management of risks in the international supply chain is crucial to ensuring the security (and safety) of EU residents, the protection of the financial and economic interests of the EU, while at the same time facilitating legitimate trade. The ""EU Strategy and Action Plan for customs risk management"" (COM (2014) 527 final) Communication of the Commission drafts a strategy and an action plan for improving customs risk management and supply chain security. It identifies the need for customs and other competent authorities to acquire quality data on supply chain movements, to exploit them for risk assessment purposes, and to consequently adapt organizations and strategies for checks to make more efficient.
Scope:
Risk management of the movement of goods through the international supply chain requires identifying, evaluating and analysing the full range of largely diverse threats and risks associated with goods and their movements, at the EU, national, and intercontinental levels. It starts with the identification, by the custom authorities themselves, of the most serious risks, so that necessary controls are carried out at the most appropriate time and place.
Strategies and tools are needed for the timely submission to customs authorities of relevant high-quality and comprehensive data on goods moving and crossing borders, whilst taking into consideration the national and EU legal, procedural and IT systems where they exist. Realistic methodologies and organisations need to develop, that facilitate collaboration among the relevant authorities (not only customs but also law enforcement, transport, security and border control agencies). Data governance policies and mechanisms for data sharing need to be agreed internationally.
Common repositories that take advantage of existing instruments such as the Advance Cargo Information System (advance electronic notification of cargo coming into EU before it leaves the third country) which are under-utilised and under-exploited for risk management purpose, can support the intelligent use and management of complex and large amount of data, exploiting unstructured data, supporting operational and situational awareness of customs authorities, adding intelligence (trends analysis, correlation analysis, etc.) by means of state-of-the-art technologies including in the fields of Big Data, Data Analytics, Data mining, Visualization, Intelligent User's Interfaces, Insight knowledge and knowledge representation, artificial intelligence, automatic language translation. The governance of access to such repositories need to be addressed.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission. Legal entities established in countries not listed in General Annex A and international organisations will be eligible for funding only when the Commission deems participation of the entity essential for carrying out the action.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 5million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Contribution to the implementation of the EU strategy and action plan for customs Risk management (COM (2014)527) endorsed by the Council in December 2014, and an integral part of the European Agenda for Security.
Proposals for making better use of additional Advance Cargo Information (ACI) – currently being discussed as part of a supplementary Delegated Regulation to EU Reg 952/2013 (in relation to the Union Customs Code);
Reduction of terrorist threats; illicit trading of arms; illicit trading, in general, and counterfeiting; drug trafficking; irregular border crossing; trafficking in human beings; smuggling;
Mitigation of risks resulting from capacity shortages in some Member States, by addressing risks in a transnational manner;
More effective and efficient information sharing among customs within Europe, as well as between customs, security and law enforcement agencies within individual countries, with a view to improving checks at the external border of the relevant European areas;

Extensive research has developed, in recent years, methods and techniques to enhance support to those involved in countering explosive threats, including efforts to counter Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and Home-Made Explosives (HMEs). But up until now, no comprehensive research has assessed the effectiveness, the efficiency and the cost of the combination of these methods and techniques (including those developed outside of these civilian sphere) to stop the threat at some point in time before the attack.
Scope:
Innovative approaches are required to: assess the effectiveness of the methods and techniques used to counter a threat at certain point in time of the plot, against credible scenarios based on real cases; assess how to best combine methods and techniques along the timeline of a plot; identify methods and techniques able to fill in existing gaps.
Methods and techniques to be considered include:
Intelligence to spot those preparing for an attack;
The inhibition of precursors;
Detection of specific chemicals, bomb factories, and/or IED;
Neutralization of IED;
Identification of weakness of the current defences against IED, and possible improvements.
Scenarios should take into account the type of explosive (e.g. home-made, conventional) and the means of transit and deployment (e.g. person-borne, vehicle-borne, left baggage), as both factors influence how effective a given combination of methods or technologies can be. No technological development is foreseen, but rather operational research undertaken in close cooperation with practitioners and building, among others, upon the work of relevant FP7 projects, of the European Network on the Detection of Explosives (NDE), and of successive activities. The results of the action should serve as a basis for the future development of new and innovative detection techniques on explosives to create a step change from current methods and technologies.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going cooperation should be taken into account.

Expected Impact:
Short term:
Better knowledge of the effectiveness of the supporting methods and techniques and of the combination of technologies used to detect and locate an explosive and to counter the terrorist use of an explosive threat.
Better understanding of the weakness of current defences against IED.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, practitioners interested in the uptake of security research and innovation (e.g. firefighters, police and intelligence communities, border guards, custom authorities, explosive specialists, forensic laboratories, medical emergency teams, etc.) are dedicated to performing their duty and to focusing on their operation. In general, practitioners’ organisations have little means to free workforces from daily operations, and to dedicate time and resources to monitor innovation and research that could be useful to them. They have little opportunities to interact with academia or with industry on such issues. All stakeholders – public services, industry, academia – including those who participate in the Security Advisory Group, recognize it as an issue.
Scope:
Practitioners are invited to associate in 4 different categories of networks:
a. Practitioners (end-users) in the same discipline and from across Europe (some examples: firefighters; police and intelligence bodies; border guards, coast guards, and custom authorities; explosive specialists; forensic laboratories; medical emergency teams; think-tanks on security; etc.) can get together to: 1) monitor research and innovation projects with a view to recommending the uptake or the industrialisation of results, 2) express common requirements as regards innovations that could fill in capability and other gaps and improve their performance in the future, and 3) indicate priorities as regards domains requiring more standardization;
b. Practitioners (end-users) from different disciplines and concerned with current or future security or disaster risk and crisis management issues in a particular geographical area can get together to: 1) monitor research and innovation projects with a view to recommending the uptake or the industrialisation of results, 2) express common requirements as regards innovations that could fill in capability and other gaps and improve their performance in the future, and 3) indicate priorities as regards common capabilities, or interfaces among capabilities, requiring more standardization.
Geographical priorities include:
the Mediterranean region (including the Black Sea): to enable an EU joint network concept for border protection and other security- and disaster-related tasks, so that the entities in the network share information, collaborate better, and establish joint border surveillance scenario. The network should provide with human infrastructure organizing operations more efficiently and enable the coordinated use of interconnected information systems and national infrastructure in the whole region;
the Arctic and North Atlantic region: to prepare to cope as a network with the security threats that will result from the opening of the Northern passages, which are very important for the development of the region, but from which seaborne disasters are likely to arise. The current lack of infrastructure makes dealing with catastrophic incidents quite a challenge. The region needs to prepare, taking into account geographical specificities (climate-related, demographic, topologic, and in relation with the functioning of space-based systems;)
the Danube river basin: to enable an EU joint network concept for disaster resilience, so that the countries of the region, which faces natural disasters, particularly flooding in a repetitive manner, can benefit at most from the EU civil protection mechanism;
the Baltic region: to enable innovative border control cooperation e.g. with respect to smuggling and other security related issues, to the trafficking in human beings, to maritime surveillance, and to macro-regional risk scenarios and gaps identification; to support the Baltic Sea Maritime Functionalities flagship initiative
These networks should gather the largest number of Member States or Associated Countries.
c. Entities from around Europe that manage demonstration and testing sites, training facilities, including simulators or serious gaming platforms in the area of CBRN and for first responders or civil protection practitioners, can get together to: 1) establish and maintain a roster of capabilities and facilities, and 2) organize to share expertise, and 3) plan to pool and share resources with a view to optimize investments.
Opinions expressed and reported by the networks of practitioners should be checked against what can be reasonably expected, and according to which timetable, from providers of innovative solutions.
d. In addition, support will be given in 2017 to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of security research. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. The network should focus on issues specific to the ""Secure societies …"" challenge and follow up on the work of SEREN 3.[1]
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about € 3.5 million per action for a duration of 5 years (recommended duration) for Parts a), b) and c); about € 2 million per action for a duration of 3 years (recommended duration) for Part d) would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Common understanding of innovation potential, more widely accepted understanding, expression of common innovation and standardization needs among practitioners in the same discipline.
More articulated and coordinated uptake of innovative solutions among practitioners from different disciplines who are often called to act together to face major crisis.
More efficient use of investments made across Europe in demonstration, testing, and training facilities for first responders.
Synergies with already established European, national and sub-national networks of practitioners, even if these networks are for the time being only dedicated to aspects of practitioners' work unrelated to research and innovation (in general, to the coordination of their operations).
An improved and professionalised NCP service, consistent across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.

","Coordination and support action
","01 March 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, practitioners interested in the uptake of security research and innovation (e.g. firefighters, police and intelligence communities, border guards, custom authorities, explosive specialists, forensic laboratories, medical emergency teams, etc.) are dedicated to performing their duty and to focusing on their operation. In general, practitioners’ organisations have little means to free workforces from daily operations, and to dedicate time and resources to monitor innovation and research that could be useful to them. They have little opportunities to interact with academia or with industry on such issues. All stakeholders – public services, industry, academia – including those who participate in the Security Advisory Group, recognize it as an issue.
Scope:
Practitioners are invited to associate in 4 different categories of networks:
a. Practitioners (end-users) in the same discipline and from across Europe (some examples: firefighters; police and intelligence bodies; border guards, coast guards, and custom authorities; explosive specialists; forensic laboratories; medical emergency teams; think-tanks on security; etc.) can get together to: 1) monitor research and innovation projects with a view to recommending the uptake or the industrialisation of results, 2) express common requirements as regards innovations that could fill in capability and other gaps and improve their performance in the future, and 3) indicate priorities as regards domains requiring more standardization;
b. Practitioners (end-users) from different disciplines and concerned with current or future security or disaster risk and crisis management issues in a particular geographical area can get together to: 1) monitor research and innovation projects with a view to recommending the uptake or the industrialisation of results, 2) express common requirements as regards innovations that could fill in capability and other gaps and improve their performance in the future, and 3) indicate priorities as regards common capabilities, or interfaces among capabilities, requiring more standardization.
Geographical priorities include:
the Mediterranean region (including the Black Sea): to enable an EU joint network concept for border protection and other security- and disaster-related tasks, so that the entities in the network share information, collaborate better, and establish joint border surveillance scenario. The network should provide with human infrastructure organizing operations more efficiently and enable the coordinated use of interconnected information systems and national infrastructure in the whole region;
the Arctic and North Atlantic region: to prepare to cope as a network with the security threats that will result from the opening of the Northern passages, which are very important for the development of the region, but from which seaborne disasters are likely to arise. The current lack of infrastructure makes dealing with catastrophic incidents quite a challenge. The region needs to prepare, taking into account geographical specificities (climate-related, demographic, topologic, and in relation with the functioning of space-based systems;)
the Danube river basin: to enable an EU joint network concept for disaster resilience, so that the countries of the region, which faces natural disasters, particularly flooding in a repetitive manner, can benefit at most from the EU civil protection mechanism;
the Baltic region: to enable innovative border control cooperation e.g. with respect to smuggling and other security related issues, to the trafficking in human beings, to maritime surveillance, and to macro-regional risk scenarios and gaps identification; to support the Baltic Sea Maritime Functionalities flagship initiative
These networks should gather the largest number of Member States or Associated Countries.
c. Entities from around Europe that manage demonstration and testing sites, training facilities, including simulators or serious gaming platforms in the area of CBRN and for first responders or civil protection practitioners, can get together to: 1) establish and maintain a roster of capabilities and facilities, and 2) organize to share expertise, and 3) plan to pool and share resources with a view to optimize investments.
Opinions expressed and reported by the networks of practitioners should be checked against what can be reasonably expected, and according to which timetable, from providers of innovative solutions.
d. In addition, support will be given in 2017 to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of security research. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. The network should focus on issues specific to the ""Secure societies …"" challenge and follow up on the work of SEREN 3.[1]
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about € 3.5 million per action for a duration of 5 years (recommended duration) for Parts a), b) and c); about € 2 million per action for a duration of 3 years (recommended duration) for Part d) would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Common understanding of innovation potential, more widely accepted understanding, expression of common innovation and standardization needs among practitioners in the same discipline.
More articulated and coordinated uptake of innovative solutions among practitioners from different disciplines who are often called to act together to face major crisis.
More efficient use of investments made across Europe in demonstration, testing, and training facilities for first responders.
Synergies with already established European, national and sub-national networks of practitioners, even if these networks are for the time being only dedicated to aspects of practitioners' work unrelated to research and innovation (in general, to the coordination of their operations).
An improved and professionalised NCP service, consistent across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to the Research Executive Agency and will be implemented by the Commission services.

This Knowledge Transfer Network topic focusses on the assessment, transfer, communication and sharing of research results among the ATM community.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 1.1 topic a).
The specific challenge is to be addressed by the Knowledge Transfer Network, in order to support and encourage collaborative research on future and emerging innovative ideas, expertise and knowledge for the benefit of the future evolution of the European ATM system. The KTN will address the challenge to stimulate the learning and exchange of knowledge from academia, research community and industrial partners following up already on the SESAR 1 research network results and also stimulating the transfer of new knowledge from other disciplines.
The Knowledge Transfer Network will also include the organisation and running of interdisciplinary or ‘themed’ research network activities based around key ATM research subjects and SJU exploratory research projects with the aim to stimulate learning and the exchange of knowledge between academia. The interdisciplinary or “themed” research activities will include a provision of a platform for training, transfer of knowledge and PhD research activities.
The range of possible themes for the network activities to be included covers the key subject areas for SESAR 2020 exploratory research:
Automation,
Robotics & Autonomy;
Complexity Data Science & Information Management;
Environment & Meteorology for ATM;
Performance, Economics,
Legal & Regulation; ATM role in Intermodal transport;
CNS for ATM;

Scope:
The Knowledge Transfer Network shall cover the following research activities:
Communication – organisation of workshops and symposiums, ATM research summer schools, the development of newsletters and other actions aimed at the dissemination and sharing of SESAR exploratory research results.
Observatory and roadmap – monitoring, identification and analysis of new opportunities for innovative ATM research of relevance to the evolution of the European ATM system and the development of a long-term roadmap development of innovative and interdisciplinary ATM concepts beyond SESAR 2020. The Observatory is expected to host the open source framework models, tools and metrics developed by SESAR 1 WP-E projects and in addition contain information (e.g. scientific articles, PhD theses, conference presentations, etc.) about worldwide long-term research in ATM related trends. Based on the generated knowledge from the KTN activities combined with the knowledge from the Observatory. The KTN is expected to produce a long-term roadmap for innovative and interdisciplinary ATM concepts beyond SESAR 2020 in the timeframe.The roadmap may contain information on the SESAR R&D Priorities in the long-term period for SESAR Concepts evolution and beyond SESAR 2020.
Take-up – stimulate the transfer of exploratory research results towards ATM applications-oriented research and onwards towards industrial research. This will include the assessment of direct/indirect impacts of SESAR Exploratory Research program on the long-term evolution of the European ATM system including establishing stronger links performance measures. The Networks will identify the maturity of research results and facilitate the link with research at higher-levels of maturity for example within the SESAR Industrial research programme.
Future ATM Skilled work-force – supports European ATM education and training in the ATM Community to develop new talent with a deep knowledge of the future ATM scientific research needs which will sustain a supply of bright young ATM research talent in the long term as well as stimulating the next generation of ATM operational and engineering staff. The future ATM skilled work-force activity will provide opportunities for postgraduate students to participate and contribute to ATM research in Europe including support for PhD research projects. The specific PhD topics themselves do not need to form part of the proposal but will be administered by the KTN. The proposal should outline how this will be achieved. PhD proposals must contain innovative research ideas and address the long-term evolution of the European ATM system. The PhD researchers are expected regularly to present their research at summer schools and workshops, organized by the Knowledge Transfer Networks and submit scientific papers for the SESAR Innovation Days conferences.
Support to SJU initiatives – support the organisation of the SESAR Innovation Days research conference and the SESAR Young Scientist Award.The SJU will provide a link to its Scientific Committee who also takes a key role in these activities.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes and in accordance with the SJU Annual Work Programme (Amendment 1) and the Single Programming Document 2017-2019.
Expected Impact:
The expected impacts from the KTN activities will be cross-fertilization of knowledge from other disciplines that will encourage the exploration of innovative and unconventional ideas and research directions in ATM. Research proposals are expected to contribute to transferring SESAR exploratory research results to SESAR Industrial Research. In parallel the PhD researchers who are part of the KTN are expected to become Europe’s scientific and technological leaders in the European ATM environment. Other expected impacts are the kick-starting of new ideas, new research directions and roadmaps contributing to the evolution of the European ATM system beyond SESAR 2020.
The KTN activities will be encouraging European research leadership of new and emerging ATM concepts and ideas with the strong engagement of scientists, citizens, innovators and policy makers and non-ATM stakeholders."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Low levels of situational awareness on the EU borders, high at sea and on unpopulated or scarcely populated land areas, are important factors of cost of border surveillance. This could improve if the different prototypes of unmanned vehicles tested today to perform automatically a very limited set of functions and routines could be transformed into autonomous, long-enduring agents able to operate in complex maritime and land environments.
Current border control systems involve a wide range of heterogeneous assets – manned and unmanned – to survey from air, surface (land and sea) and underwater. Similarly the objects of their surveillance may be vessels, land vehicles, aircrafts, and underwater vehicles used, for instance, for smuggling and trafficking. Only enhanced command and control systems using advanced 3D computer graphics technology may allow to represent accurately the position of surveillance assets – including autonomous agents – and external objects in such complex environments.
Scope:
The proposed action should cover one of the following sub-topics:
Sub-topic: 1.Autonomous surveillance
Autonomous agents should be adaptable: in order to deal, where applicable, with extreme and diverse weather and sea condition, including in the Artic region; interconnected: interoperable and capable of exchanging information among themselves and with the system's ground segment; tele-operable from the ground.
They should support missions ranging from surveillance to detection of marine pollution incidents, and including early identification and tracking of illegal activities and illegal communication.
They should operate as single units, but also in homogeneous or heterogeneous groups i.e. mixing aerostats, aerial vehicles with fix, rotary wings (or tilt-rotor), unmanned surface vehicles (USV), unmanned under-surface vehicles (UUSV), unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) with different types of sensor and communication suites on board, customized according to operational and environmental needs and addressing cross-cueing.
Autonomous agents should exchange information at tactical level and interface with each other and with command and control systems as they exist, today, at different levels.
Sub-topic: 2.Enhanced command and control systems for the surveillance of borders in a 3D environment Autonomous surveillance
Enhanced command and control systems should integrate:
air surveillance technologies (including radar technologies for the detection of low flying aircrafts);
coastal and underwater surveillance technologies (including coastal radar, maritime patrol aircraft (MPA), light patrol aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), Patrol Vessels, UUV, etc.);
ground surveillance technologies (including UGV);
satellite-based services;
maritime information services;
3D cartography and bathymetry servers;
3D modelling of situational picture based on 3D computers graphics engines;
augmented reality technologies;
mobile devices and handsets such as tablets and smartphones.
The participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission. Legal entities established in countries not listed in General Annex A and international organisations will be eligible for funding only when the Commission deems participation of the entity essential for carrying out the action.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or7; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 8million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Further development of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR);
Provision of more information that may be exchanged across sectors and borders through the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE);
New technologies for autonomous surveillance systems;
Improved, cost-effective and efficient unmanned platforms for border surveillance systems, and the detection of marine pollution incidents;
Adaptation of long-tested technologies to the specific requirements of borders control area;
Agents and command and control systems interoperable with existing, multi-country European infrastructure.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This demonstration will demonstrate the airborne aspects of the synchronization of the air and ground views of the trajectory based on the downlinking of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance (Contract) (ADS-C) Aeronautical Telecommunications Surveillance Baseline 2 (ATN B2) Extended Projected Profile (EPP) data from aircraft to the ground systems, in accordance with the provisions of the PCP AF#6.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 2.1 topic d).
The collection of ADS-C data from revenue flights operated from different AUs in a variety of operational conditions is necessary in order to understand the impact of a diversity of operating practices on the data that is effectively downlinked. This will allow the fine tuning of the requirements for the integration of the downlinked data into the ground systems.
Scope:
Initial trajectory sharing has been researched in the SESAR programme. Full details of the SESAR Solutions can be found on the SESAR web site[1] or in the Solutions Catalogue[2]. As a guide, SESAR solution 115 “Initial Trajectory Information Sharing” is the most relevant solution demonstration activity. Note that Solution 115 is under development and is, at the time of writing, not yet published.
The airborne trajectory prediction done by the Flight Management System (FMS) takes into account flight performance data that is updated in real time during the execution phase, such as descent planning information, aircraft weight, and the most updated temperature and wind predictions. This solution allows the downlinking of data based on the airborne trajectory prediction using the Extended Projected Profile (EPP), as defined by the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network Baseline 2 (ATN B2). The downlinked data is used by the ground systems to enrich their trajectory prediction.
The topic is subject to on-going Industrial Research (IR) and Very Large Scale Demonstration (VLD) activities within the SESAR 2020 programme. This project must ensure that its activities are coordinated with parallel projects working in this area. In particular, this action follows on from the project PJ31 DIGITS funded under call H2020-SESAR-2015-2. Consortia applying for this topic must include at least one AU, and may include additional entities provided their role in supporting the demonstration from the AU perspective is adequately justified in the proposal.
Demonstration flights shall take place in the area controlled by the following ACCs: Maastricht, Karlsruhe and London. Participating Airspace Users (AU) will not need to dispatch any flights for the sole purpose of the demonstrations, i.e. participation shall always be through revenue flights. It is desirable that a variety of airframes participate in this demonstration, so as to be representative of the fleet operating in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) EUR region. Applicants should demonstrate how their flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project.
It is a pre-requisite for each airframe taking part in this demonstration that it is equipped with datalink able to deliver “Best in Class” performance as defined by the ELSA report [8] Each airframe taking part in this demonstration will need to be equipped with ATN B2 communications equipment, potentially including the full automatic upload onto the FMS of uplinked Controller Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC) commands. ATN B2 upgraded aircraft will need to retain their ATN B1 equipment, and will need to be capable of either switching between one and the other or operating them in parallel as required by the demonstration. The upgrade of Flight Management Systems (FMS) to DO236C standards may also be necessary.
The final equipment and configuration will need to have final airworthiness approval by EASA. The cost of those upgrades to the avionics that are necessary for the demonstration will be eligible for co-financing under this grant.
During the demonstration flights, flight crews will be required to perform the tasks associated with the management of the newly installed equipment, but will otherwise be expected to conduct their flights as usual in order to provide realistic data for the operational evaluation of the concept of air/ground trajectory synchronization. The demonstration may include the uplink through ATB B2 CPDLC of 3D routes (e.g. descent routes with constraint along the way). 3D routes may be uplinked without a clearance (e.g. through EXPECT CPLDC messages) in accordance with the innovative share-the-ground-plan concept, in order to allow the FMS to anticipate the descent profile before a clearance can be effectively delivered by ATC.
The expected involvement of consortia answering to this open call shall be in accordance to the following requirements:
AUs shall perform the demonstrations in collaboration with parallel demonstration projects dealing with the same subject to develop the concept of the demonstrations, participation in activities preparing the trials, participation in periodic follow-up meetings, production of all the documentation related to the demonstration as well as results dissemination and communication activities. Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.
Participating AUs will not need to dispatch any flights for the sole purpose of the demonstrations, i.e. participation shall always be through revenue flights. Participating AUs shall provide to the ANSP relevant data from their revenue flights for the operational evaluation of the performance of the concepts under demonstration. These data may include, among others, questionnaires or other feedback by airline staff (flight-crews and/or Airline Operations Centre (AOC) personnel), fuel burn data (potentially including suitably aggregated and de-identified FDR data), scheduling and punctuality data and descent efficiency data.
In addition to the aforementioned data, it would be preferable that a log of how each individual demonstration flight was managed (flight crew FMS/Flight Control Unit (FCU) automatically-recorded flight-crew input log and data and voice communications log) was made available for the portion of the flight in which the demonstration takes place. This detailed log is valuable in order to perform a comparison against the downlinked EPP data logs, with the objective of better understanding the interrelation of operational flight management actions and the data that is downlinked from the aircraft. AUs applying for this call must specify in their bid if they will provide these logs, and if so they must also describe how they will ensure that the confidentiality and access rights of the participating flight crews are respected.
Expected Impact:
This demonstration will pave the way for the implementation of the AF6 of the PCP. The synchronization of the air and ground trajectories is expected to bring benefits in terms of flight efficiency, mainly by enabling better descent profiles and improved arrival sequencing. The better quality of the ground trajectory prediction will also allow the improvement of the tools that support controllers, thereby increasing ANS productivity. Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This demonstration will address common support function which would allow temporary provision of some services or information such as Flight plan or radar information in order to ensure continuity in the delivery of efficient ATS services in case of major technical failure at one of the ACCs.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.1 topic e).
As the airspace of Europe becomes ever more congested, the ability of the Network to absorb the disruption resulting from a significant loss of capacity for numerous reasons, including technical failure, degrades. This has the potential to lead to widespread delays and eventually cancellations to flights which result in unacceptable disruption and unexpected extra costs for airlines and passengers alike.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to demonstrate examples of how resilience in ATM service provision can be increased through the geographical decoupling of the ATM Data Service Providers from the Air Traffic Service Units so that, in the event of failure, ATM data services could be provided from a remote location. This concept is known as ‘virtualisation’.
Projects should build on the introductory work conducted within SESAR 1 and SESAR Industrial Research project PJ.16 (‘CWP/HMI’). However, while the latter will be investigating the full scope of the Virtual Centre concept, projects awarded under this topic will have to identify and demonstrate quick-wins that will help to provide valuable insight and experience with the concept of virtualisation, and so provide ‘lessons-learned’ to the wider investigation and developments conducted in SESAR2020.
The services identified as candidates for virtualisation are as follows:
Flight Data Management;
Flight Data Distribution;
Coordination and Transfer;
Correlation Management;
Correlation Distribution ;
Arrival Sequence Distribution and Management (AMAN);
Monitoring Aids (MONA) Distribution;
Safety Nets (SNET) Distribution and Management;
Medium Term Conflict Detection (MTCD) and Management;
Projects should be conducted by at least two ANSPs to develop a common contingency demonstration environment to demonstrate improved continuity of efficient ATM service provision, in high-level en-route airspace, in the event of a major technical failure at one of Europe’s major Air Traffic Control Centres (ACCs). The project will investigate how virtualisation could be used in this regard.
Projects will consider and evaluate the three streams of the virtualisation concept, reporting in detail on each within the scope of the demonstration. The three streams are:
Business;
Operational; and
Technical.
Output from the project should include observations and recommendations for procedural, operational, technological, regulatory and standardisation activities that would be necessary to enable the wider implementation of virtualisation within the ATM domain.
The demonstration activities shall cover the full demonstration lifecycle. This includes development of the concept of the proposed demonstrations, production of all the documentation related to the demonstration (most notably including the demonstration plan and the demonstration report), and results dissemination and communication activities. The demonstrations have to be backed by an appropriate project management structure that is centred on timely delivery, including notably robust quality and risk management.
Expected Impact:
ATM service provision can be severely impacted by serious technical failures and increased resilience of this service provision would provide significant economic benefits to aviation stakeholders and the communities they support."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This demonstration will address the use of advanced on-board equipment and GNSS augmentation through EGNOS or GBAS by business aviation to support safe access to small and medium-size airports to ILS Cat II and Cat III-equivalent minima.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.1 topic f).
Not all airports have advanced landing aids as the ones currently found at larger airports which allow operations in bad weather. Small to medium size airports are located in geographical locations where IFR approaches are difficult or impossible due to their proximity to high terrain or other obstacles. Business Aviation needs to operate, with increased resilience, at such smaller airfields. However, the concepts being demonstrated will be of relevance to all airports where any reduction of landing minima could be implemented, to the benefit of all types of operator.
Scope:
The purpose of this demonstration is to demonstrate:
Use of RNP procedures to enable IFR approaches at airports where landing aids do not currently exist to support landings to ILS Cat II/III equivalent minima; and
Use of flight-deck vision-support systems which, when combined with other landing aids, enable landings to ILS Cat II/III equivalent minima.
The project will build on previous SESAR research and demonstration work and will help to further develop existing SESAR Solutions, including:
Solution 55: Precision approaches using GBAS Category II/III;
Solution 09: Enhanced terminal operations with RNP transition to ILS/GLS;
Solution 51: Enhanced terminal operations with RNP transition to LPV; and
Solution 103: Approach procedures with vertical guidance.
The demonstrations will comprise live flights. These flights could be with dedicated trials aircraft or with standard commercial flights, subject to the appropriate regulatory approvals. It is intended that consortia applying for this demonstration will comprise all relevant stakeholders, including AU, ANSP, airport operator and industry, as appropriate. However, where not included directly in the consortium, applicants shall explain in their proposal how their involvement will be assured.
The demonstration should cover as wide a range of GNSS procedures as possible, including SBAS and, if possible GBAS. The demonstration shall include the use of flight-deck vision systems, such as synthetic vision systems (SVS) and enhanced flight vision systems (EFVS) which, when used in combination with augmented GNSS approaches, could further reduce landing minima. Applicants shall demonstrate how the nature and scale of their proposed flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project.
It is recognised that demonstrating Cat II and especially Cat III approaches may be problematic in the current regulatory and technological environment. The demonstration shall demonstrate approaches to as low a minimum as possible and, should this not equate to Cat II or Cat III, a detailed analysis shall be performed to highlight issues and create a technological and regulatory roadmap to enabling achievement of full Cat II and Cat III operations.
Applicants for this demonstration must have aircraft that are certified to fly RNP approaches with EGNOS-augmented vertical guidance, that is specifically not BARO VNAV, and, optionally, GBAS approaches. In their proposals they must specify the airframes that they intend to use for the demonstration, detailing their equipage level. The demonstration shall use certified equipment for GNSS approaches and perform demonstrations at locations where the possibility of operational deployment exists on completion of the demonstration.
Applicants shall explain in their proposal which data they will collect and make available for the operational evaluation of the performance of the concepts under demonstration. These data may include, among others, questionnaires or other feedback by flight crews, fuel burn data (potentially including suitably aggregated and de-identified FDR data), and approach efficiency data.
Credit will be given to applicants who include both fixed-wing and rotorcraft stakeholders in their consortium, and who demonstrate a firm agreement with stakeholders regarding location(s) for the demonstration.
The demonstration activities shall cover the full demonstration lifecycle. This includes development of the concept of the demonstrations, production of approach plates, participation in periodic meetings, production of all the documentation related to the demonstration (most notably including the demonstration plan and the demonstration report), and results dissemination and communication activities. The demonstration report shall include a full analysis by each participating stakeholder of the impact of the demonstrated concept on performance within their sphere of operations. Recommendations for standardisation and regulation should be made, and anticipated difficulties should be highlighted.
Expected Impact:
This demonstration project will show how access to small, medium and remote airports in bad weather conditions can be improved for business aviation. It will also improve resilience at airports where business aviation operators currently fly, through reducing the impact of bad weather on their operations. Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Aviation is a global industry and interoperability together with global harmonisation are key for its safe and sustained growth, the activities in the scope of this call should address global interoperability demonstrations targeting operational changes that are considered to be on the critical path for ATM modernisation.
The SJU works to promote global interoperability and harmonisation through active engagement in the development and the implementation of the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO), Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) and its Aviation System Block Upgrade (ASBUs). To this end, it has entered into cooperation arrangements with a number of international partners.
The awarded project is expected to set up a global demonstration that involves non-European regions and ATM actors. The consortium should show sufficient involvement of the required stakeholders for the success of the project (ANSPs, Airspace Users, Industries, global partners...).
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.2 topic a).
This topic is about demonstrating that trajectory based operations can be performed with global interoperability using satellite data communication, navigation and surveillance as the enabler for seamless transitions. An essential objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining SESAR’s Continental initial trajectory sharing concept (i4D EPP) with oceanic and Inter-continental operations. In particular the project is expected to prove that Satellite technology like Satcom can operate as a versatile enabler to global datalink without the need for aircraft to equip with as many avionics configurations as today. Additionally, the project is expected to take advantage of the ongoing initiatives on Satellite based surveillance over the oceanic airspace to demonstrate opportunities to reduce separation and enhance ATM performance.
Projects should ensure that they include content/scope of work leading to specific comments and recommendations relating to ICAO provisions and standardisation as well as towards Standards Making Organisations (SMO´s).
Scope:
Trajectory-based operation includes the management of Trajectories focussing on the flight needs in 4 dimensions through the lifecycle of planning, execution and post-flight analysis. The aim of the TBO is as described in SESAR and ICAO to improve performance of air traffic operations and increase the overall predictability of the air traffic system. The 4D Trajectory (4DT) information set encompasses relevant trajectory flight data, including latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. NextGen and SESAR activities on this subject are well under way and have with a number of States and stakeholders agreements of the TBO concepts need of models for exchanging and sharing 4DT information.
The scope of the successful project should include the following elements at minimum:
A significant number of Inter-continental revenue flights involving aircraft equipped with the required avionics supporting the capabilities for the demos.
Simultaneous use of satellite Communication, Navigation and Surveillance capability.
Enhanced ATM operations in continental and oceanic airspace
Initial trajectory exchange (i4D/EPP)
Satellite-based Communication, Navigation and Surveillance capability (eg Satcom, SBB)
Investigation of technical solution for Satcom that seamlessly operates in ATN-B2 and FANS environments
Investigation of technical solution for gateways accommodating both ATN/OSI and ATN/IPS in the same region.
Based on a significant number of Inter-continental revenue flights, the demonstration should operate Advanced ATM operations (i4D, PBN, enhanced arrivals/departures, reduced separations, IM…) in the various phases of flight with CNS services being enabled by satellite solutions (Satcom, Satellite-based ADS-B and GNSS).
Production of public communication material (eg brochures, video, website…)
Applicants should demonstrate how their flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project. Due to the complex nature of this project, the awarded consortium should demonstrate and implement strong level of project management and reporting principles (structure, milestones, intermediate steps, documentations, risk management…).
Activities under this topic will focus on demonstrating the performance of SESAR enabled solutions with clear operational applications objective. Interaction with relevant demonstration platforms, in and outside of Europe is within scope, but most of the work should cover the ability of operational stakeholders to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged to improve performance in operational (or close to operational) environments.
The project should take advantage of the SESAR solutions (Full details of the SESAR Solutions can be found on the SESAR web site[1] or in the Solutions Catalogue[2]). In particular:
Solution #115: Initial Trajectory Information Sharing :
The airborne trajectory prediction performed by the Flight Management System (FMS) takes into account flight performance data that is updated in real time during the execution phase, such as descent planning information, aircraft weight, and the most updated temperature and wind predictions. This solution allows the downlinking of data based on the airborne trajectory prediction using the Extended Projected Profile (EPP), as defined by the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network Baseline 2 (ATN B2). The downlinked data is used by the ground systems to enrich their trajectory prediction.
Solution #109:Air Traffic Services (ATS) datalink using Iris Precursor:
The solution offers a viable option for air traffic services (ATS) datalink using existing satellite technology systems to support initial four-dimensional (i4D) datalink capability. The technology can be used to provide end-to-end air–ground communications for i4D operations, connecting aircraft and air traffic management ground systems.
An example of a demonstration covering the requirements could be the following:
The aircraft uses the SWIM services before departure for weather information and AOC coordination. AMAN/DMAN connectivity could be included as well.
Advanced departures could be performed in the take-off with for example noise abatement procedure.
All along the European Airspace, the aircraft is expected to perform ATN B2 initial trajectory sharing with CPDLC and ADS operating over Satcom. When appropriate, oceanic track entry could be optimised using the downlinked information. Over the Ocean, the demonstration could take benefit from the reduced separation enabled by Satellite based ADS-B combined with Communication capability enabled by the Satcom. Advanced Oceanic procedures could also be included.
When arriving to the destination, the aircraft could demonstrate enhanced queue management techniques and arrival procedures (Extended AMAN, PBN approaches, RNP to XLS transitions using the GNSS). The data communication will be operated over Satcom in the target region.
Expected Impact:
The provision of Satellite enabling trajectory based operations will offer a solution for the long-haul carriers the possibility to significantly lower their procurement costs and benefit from versatile enablers to global interoperability without the need for aircraft to equip with as many avionics configurations in the absence of any additional service.
Due to non-radar coverage, the current lateral separation standard in the oceanic airspace is significantly greater than the standard in the continental airspace (approximately 4 times more conservative). Reducing the separation standard over the oceanic airspace, through the use of combined satellite based surveillance and communication will allow for a significant improvement in ATM capacity and performance.
Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In today’s situation Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) usually host a monolithic ATM system in each Air Traffic System Unit (ATSU) with very few information services and infrastructure elements being shared between the different centres. In the Virtual Centre approach, the Controller Working Positions are decoupled and may even be geographically separated from the ATM information services that they consume, and these ATM information services may be shared between different ATSUs or even between ANSPs. The main benefits expected from the Virtual Centre approach are cost reduction and more flexibility to support load-balancing between the participating ATSUs or manage contingency situations. The development of technical services and common interfaces resulting from new technologies, working methods, Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and procedures would also need to address human factors considerations. The proliferation of proprietary systems with proprietary interfaces shall be avoided as well as the use of non-user friendly interfaces.
Scope:
This VLD aims at demonstrating solution #16-03, which is expected to reach TRL6 in Wave 1. The solution allows an innovative Virtual Centre architecture between a Virtual Centre ATSU and ATM Data Service Provider (ADSP). The demonstration shall provide added value with respect to the technical validation performed by 16-03 e.g. increased number of validated services for the SOA architecture including cross validation of the services
The technical use cases may include demonstration validation of the required quality of service is met, in particular for the transfer of data between geographically separated locations, remote installation of HMI, remote supervision, transversal technical features as recording. Although demonstrations are normally aiming at live trials, in this case it is acceptable to achieve the objectives through other techniques such as shadow mode. In any case, connection to real data is expected.
Expected Impact:
The demonstration shall provide evidences on the technical feasibility of the solution and benefits in terms of cost-efficiency."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The demonstration will demonstrate the benefits for Airspace User (AU) in the operation of cross-border Arrival Management systems (AMAN) with an extended horizon in accordance with the Pilot Common Project (PCP)[1] First Air Traffic Management (ATM) Functionality (AF#1), as well as the demonstration of AU involvement in the operation of two AMAN-related advanced concepts: the Target Time (TT) management concept and the Arrival Flexibility (A-FLEX) concept, which connect the Extended AMAN concept to the PCP Fourth ATM Functionality (AF#4).
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 2.1 topic a).
Specific challenge
The use of an extended horizon for Arrival Management (AMAN) creates an overlap in terms of look-ahead time between queue management processes and Air Traffic Flow Control Management (ATFCM) Target Time (TT) management processes, as well as introducing an increased need for cross-border coordination. These challenges also create new opportunities for the development of operating methods that make it possible the increased participation of AUs through Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) Processes, including A-FLEX processes. The active involvement of AUs in this demonstration is needed for the evaluation in a live environment of these concepts and the quantification of their benefits.
Scope:
Extended AMAN and TT management have been subject to research and development in the SESAR programme, with deployment-ready results published as solution packs (SESAR Solution 5, Extended Arrival Management Horizon, and SESAR solution 18, Calculated Takeoff Time (CTOT) and Target Time of Arrival (TTA)). The Extended AMAN, the AFLEX and the TT management concepts are subject to continuing current Industrial Research (IR) and Very Large Scale Demonstration (VLD) activities within the SESAR 2020 programme. This project will demonstrate the airspace user perspective of these concepts, and it must ensure that its activities are to be coordinated with parallel projects working in this area. In particular, this action follows on from the Project PJ25 XSTREAM funded under call H2020-SESAR-2015-2.
Consortia applying to this topic must include at least one AU, and they may include additional entities provided their role in supporting the demonstration from the AU perspective is adequately justified in the proposal. Participation of AUs with a variety of airframe/engine configurations so as to be representative of the fleet composition currently operating in Europe is considered as significant added value. Applicants should demonstrate how their flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project.
For the Extended AMAN trials there is no need for specific avionics equipment beyond what is currently required for operating in European airspace, and there will be no need for updating Airline Operations Centre (AOC) systems either. For the demonstration of the TT management and A-FLEX concepts, no avionics modifications are required, but AOC systems and processes may need to be updated.
AUs shall perform the demonstrations in collaboration with parallel demonstration projects dealing with the same subject to develop the concept of the demonstrations, participation in activities preparing the trials, participation in periodic follow-up meetings, production of all the documentation related to the demonstration as well as results dissemination and communication activities. Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.
Participating AUs will not need to dispatch any flights for the sole purpose of the demonstrations, i.e. participation shall always be through revenue flights. The demonstration flights shall land at the following major European Hubs: London Heathrow and Gatwick, Paris CDG/ORLY, or Zurich; their route must overfly one or more of the following ACCs: Maastricht, Reims, Paris, London, Karlsruhe, Brest, Shannon, Prestwick, Langen, Munich, Genève, Marseille, or Bordeaux.
The consortium shall provide support to the ANSPs running the demonstrations in which they participate through this grant all along the demonstration lifecycle. This expected support includes collaboration for developing the concept of the demonstrations, participation in activities preparing the trials, periodic follow-up meetings and support for the production of all the documentation related to the demonstration, as well as participation in the demonstration dissemination and communication activities. Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.
The consortium shall provide to the ANSP running the demonstrations in which they participate relevant data from their demonstration flights for the operational evaluation of the performance of the concepts under demonstration. These data may include, among others, questionnaires or other feedback by airline staff (flight-crews and/or Airline Operations Centre (AOC) personnel), fuel burn data (potentially including suitably aggregated and de-identified FDR data), scheduling and punctuality data and descent efficiency data.
Applicants should note that all flights operating in the areas where SESAR extended AMAN demonstrations are taking place will need to comply with all instructions issued by ATC that originate from the extended AMAN concept (typically speed commands or lateral route revisions).
Expected Impact:
The demonstration will pave the way for implementing the E-AMAN as required in the PCP Regulation i.e. within an integrated global collaborative management of arrivals, including Airports, ACCs and Airlines, as well as for the implementation of the related advanced concepts AFLEX and advanced TT management. The objective is to reduce ATFCM and Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area (ASMA) delays in the TMA/E-TMA and also to increase flight efficiency. Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan.

This demonstration project will coordinate the Airspace User (AU) involvement in the demonstration of innovative airport operations functionalities designed to improve airport operations. The functionalities that will be demonstrated are advanced concepts that are related to the core scope of the second Air Traffic Management (ATM) Functionality of the Pilot Common Project (AF#2 of the PCP).
In particular it demonstrates the use of two distinct functionalities designed to improve airport operations from an airspace user perspective: on-board surface traffic alerting system and On-board taxi route guidance.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.1 topic b).
Traffic growth is expected to strengthen for the coming years in most European airports. One of the major challenges, those airports will have to encounter within the next years is to manage increased congestion while maintaining safety. Whilst ground technology will play a significant part in addressing these challenges, the airspace users must integrate seamlessly, without incurring unacceptable additional costs.
Scope:
This action, which follows on from the project PJ28 IAO funded under call H2020-SESAR-2015-2, will organise the participation of airspace users in the demonstration of two distinct functionalities being developed to improve airport integration and throughput:
On-board surface traffic alerting; and
On-board taxi-route guidance.
Consortia applying for this topic must include at least one AU, and may include additional entities provided their role in supporting the demonstration from the AU perspective is adequately justified in the proposal.
The intended function of the on-board surface traffic alerting system is to increase flight crew’s situational awareness and reduce a risk of collision with other traffic on the airport’s surface through the use of a dedicated display featuring an airport moving map showing an airport layout and also the position and state of the own aircraft and its surrounding traffic, using ADS-B data.
This Wave 1 demonstration will focus on gathering a large amount of ADS-B data from revenue flights to allow off-line analysis with a view to verifying its performance and assessing its suitability for use in the traffic-alert context.
The off-line analysis, comparing the logged ADS-B data with data from A-SMGCS systems, will be undertaken by a parallel demonstration project. AU involvement shall be as follows:
Several aircraft shall be equipped with logging equipment. The flights shall be conducted mainly within Europe. The data that will be logged consists of the own aircraft and other ADS-B information received during these regular flights.
The equipment installation will need to be approved by appropriate authorities.
Data shall be logged and provided to the parallel project for off-line analysis.
The airspace users will support the off-line analysis by providing pilot feedback on the alerting that is possibly required to adjust thresholds for alerts.
On-board taxi route guidance can be provided either through manual taxi clearance insertion made by flight crews, or by the D-TAXI capability. The taxi clearance information depicted in the cockpit on a suitable display with an airport moving map significantly increases flight crews’ situational awareness, especially on complex airports.
Since D-TAXI is not widely available, this demonstration will demonstrate, on several aircraft platforms, the safety and situational awareness improvements associated with the provision of manual taxi routes to the flight crews on an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) device, using a single airline and several taxiing aircraft. This demonstration will thus support SESAR Solution #26: Manual Taxi Routing Function.
The demonstration approach will be:
An on-board surface routing and guidance system that has already achieved proven V3 maturity in SESAR will be provided to the airline. The system provider will support the airline in obtaining all required operational approvals from local authorities.
Once approved, the airline will use the on-board surface routing and guidance system on several aircraft flying their regular short- and long-haul revenue flights within and possibly outside of Europe.
Once flight crews receive the taxi clearance information from ATC via radio communication means, they will manually insert the taxi clearance information into the on-board surface routing and guidance system EFB application.
The system will depict the taxi clearance on the EFB display layered over an airport moving map.
Flight crews will use the display during all airport surface operations as needed, and will have a better awareness of the taxi situation on the airport, allowing safety and operational improvements.
Flight crews will be required to use the EFB application when taxiing on the airport surface, e.g. before taxiing for take-off as well as after landing. In cooperation with the parallel demonstration project, operational feedback will be periodically retrieved from flight crews to evaluate and confirm the system’s performance and benefits.
AUs shall perform the demonstrations in collaboration with parallel demonstration projects dealing with the same subject to develop the concept of the demonstrations, participation in activities preparing the trials, participation in periodic follow-up meetings, production of all the documentation related to the demonstration as well as results dissemination and communication activities. Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.
Participating AUs will not need to dispatch any flights for the sole purpose of the demonstrations, i.e. participation shall always be through revenue flights. Participating AUs shall make available data from their revenue flights for the operational evaluation of the performance of the concepts under demonstration. These data may include, among others, questionnaires or other feedback by airline staff (flight-crews and/or Airline Operations Centre (AOC) personnel), fuel burn data (potentially including suitably aggregated and de-identified FDR data), and scheduling and punctuality data. Applicants shall demonstrate how the scale and nature of their proposed flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project.
Expected Impact:
This demonstration project aims to form a bridge between SESAR 1 industrial research and the deployment phase by deploying demonstration platforms in a close-to operational environment in order to demonstrate the advantages of the new functionalities and to serve as a de-risking activity for the large-scale deployment of PCP-related functionalities.
Therefore, the ambition of the demonstration is to minimize the risk of the Airport Safety Nets concept deployment as well as of the on-board traffic alerting system and the Manual Taxi Clearance insertion function. Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan."

Network Collaborative Management (NCM) processes includes the participation of local actors in Air Traffic Flow Control Management (ATFCM). Airports, Flow Management Positions (FMP) located at European Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) now bear collaboratively with the Network Manager (NM) the management of DCB processes.
This demonstration will demonstrate Airspace User (AU) involvement in Demand Capacity Balancing (DCB) Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) processes managed by FMPs and by airports, in accordance with the PCP AF#4.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.1 topic c).
The new NCM concept of operations offers increased opportunities for AUs to participate in DCB CDM processes, because they can now collaborate with local DCB actors as well as with NM. The active involvement of AUs in this demonstration is needed for the evaluation in a live environment of these concepts and the quantification of their benefits.
Scope:
NCM has been subject to research in the SESAR programme. Mature results are publicly available in the solution packs for the following SESAR solutions:
SESAR solution 56 (ATFM Slot Swapping)
SESAR solution 57 (UDPP Departure)
SESAR solution 17 (Advanced Short Term ATFCM Measures (STAM))
SESAR solution 18 (CTOT and TTA)
SESAR solution 21 (Airport Operations Plan and Network Operations Plan seamless integration)
NCM is subject to continued Industrial Research (IR) and Very Large Scale Demonstration (VLD) activities within the SESAR 2020 programme. This project must ensure that its activities are coordinated with parallel projects working in this area.

Applicants should demonstrate how their flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project.
In current operations, AUs participate in DCB processes though NM’s Airport Operators Liaison Office (AOLO), that allows, for example, the coordination of re-routing options for avoiding delays. Slot-swapping processes are also available through NM. In this demonstration, new AU participation concepts will be demonstrated, in order to allow their business priorities to be taken into account in locally-managed DCB processes.

Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.
Participating AUs will not need to dispatch any flights for the sole purpose of the demonstrations, i.e. participation shall always be through revenue flights. For participating in these trials there is no need for specific avionics equipment beyond what is currently required for operating in European airspace. However, Airline Operations Centre (AOC) processes and systems may need to be updated, and participating AUs may be required to file Extended Flight Plans (EFPL) for the demonstration flights.
Demonstration flights must be in at least one of the following two categories:
Flights overflying the area controlled by the following ANSPs:
Flight taking off or landing at one of the following airports: Madrid, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Alicante, London Heathrow or Split.
The expected involvement of consortia answering to this open call shall be in accordance to the following requirements:
The consortium shall work in collaboration with other demonstration project on NCM all along the project including preparation of the trials. This expected support includes collaboration for developing the concept of the demonstrations, participation in activities preparing the trials, periodic follow-up meetings, support for the production of all the documentation related to the demonstration, as well as participation in the demonstration dissemination and communication activities. Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.
Consortia shall provide to the ANSP relevant data from their demonstration flights for the operational evaluation of the performance of the concepts under demonstration. These data may include, among others, questionnaires or other feedback by airline staff (flight-crews and/or Airline Operations Centre (AOC) personnel), fuel burn data (potentially including suitably aggregated and de-identified FDR data), scheduling and punctuality data and descent efficiency data.
Participation in advanced Target Times (TT) management demonstration concepts shall be optional. AUs submitting bids to this call should specify whether their offer includes their participation in the demonstration of TT management concepts, which will be considered an added value in the evaluation of proposals. AUs participating in the demonstration of TT management concepts shall be required to operate flights fully in accordance with the concept being demonstrated (e.g. potentially by flying at a Cost Index (CI) different from the AU’s preferred CI or rejecting a tactical path-shortening instruction for the purpose of complying with an assigned TT).
Expected Impact:
The demonstration will pave the way for implementing concepts from the PCP Air Traffic Management (ATM) NCM functionality, which is a cornerstone of the future performance-driven ATM environment in Europe. The objective is to ensure cost-efficiency and capacity performance goals are met while at the same time AU’s operational needs and requirements are fulfilled.

GNSS- based (e.g. APV SBAS/Baro) approach/departure procedures with vertical guidance procedures at busy airports by using Rotorcraft specific independent IFR procedures to/from FATO (Final Approach & Take- Off area) located at airports in order to remove IFR rotorcraft from active runways and allow fixed wing aircraft and rotorcraft to perform simultaneous non-interfering (SNI) operations. These rotorcraft-specific independent IFR operations will be enabled by Point-in-Space (PinS) procedures to allow approach to/departure from a VFR FATO. When reaching the PinS, the pilot shall decide either to proceed to a landing or to abort the approach. The PinS is also the MAPT (Missed Approach Point). Dedicated IFR SNI concepts can provide an alternative IFR capability to small airports where the installation of traditional navigation aids is not financially viable or unfeasible due to other specific constraints.
Advanced (e.g. curved) SBAS/GBAS guided PinS RNP approaches towards landing locations and PinS departures from landing locations are created with connections to/from Low Level IFR route network. The curved segment of the advanced PinS can be placed in the initial, intermediate or missed approach segment. The procedures can contribute to a reduced noise footprint and improved access to VFR FATOs. There is also a contribution to safety (fewer VFR approaches in marginal VMC, IFR approaches with vertical guidance). Use of a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) facilitates both the execution of curves in approach segments and departure procedures, and the transition from instrument flying and navigating via external visual cues. In this case, a three-dimensional path that the pilot has to follow (or to be more precise, a corridor in which the pilot has to stay) is displayed in the HMD; such a three-dimensional path has to give both lateral and vertical guidance. The HMD provides, with ‘eyes-out’ of the cockpit, the information that can be used to facilitate safe flying along the PinS procedure (take-off and approach), facilitating the transition from IFR instrument phase to visual phase (for ‘proceed visually’ PinS) or from IFR to VFR (for ‘proceed VFR’ PinS) and vice-versa, and reduces pilot workload;
‘Enhanced visual operations’ consists of taking credit of emerging visual based technologies such as EFVS and SVS combined through CVS and displayed in coloured HMD in order to increase the operational efficiency in both taxi and landing while significantly improving situational awareness.
Expected Impact:
Access and equity to airport thanks to dedicated procedure and system enabling rotorcraft and business aviation to perform approach and departure procedures in low visibility conditions."

This VLD builds on solution 46, System Wide Information Management.
Aviation is a global industry and interoperability together with global harmonisation are key for its safe and sustained growth, the activities in the scope of this call should address global interoperability demonstrations targeting operational changes that are considered to be on the critical path for ATM modernisation.
The SJU works to promote global interoperability and harmonisation through active engagement in the development and the implementation of the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO), Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) and its Aviation System Block Upgrade (ASBUs). To this end, it has entered into cooperation arrangements with a number of international partners.
The awarded project is expected to set up a global demonstration that involves non-European regions and ATM actors. The consortium should show sufficient involvement of the required stakeholders for the success of the project (ANSPs, Airspace Users, Industries, global partners...).
This demonstration involves the Airspace Users (AUs), the DCB (Demand and Capacity Balancing) units and the ANSPs (Air Navigation Service Providers) as well as their supporting manufacturing industries in the pre-operational demonstration for the ICAO FF-ICE (Flight and Flow in a Collaborative Environment) step 1 implementation following available ICAO guidance and material. As such, the focus is on the exchange of pre-departure flight data information and applying distribution mechanisms as defined in the ICAO ATMRPP (draft) provisions.
The demonstration will be conducted in a global context in collaboration with international partners, implying that the established interoperability will have a focus beyond the European boundaries. Data exchanges have to be based on the globally standardized FIXM 4.0 format (Flight Information Exchange Model, see www.fixm.aero) including the 4DT (4-Dimensional Trajectory), the FSPD (Flight Specific Performance Data) and the GUFI (Globally Unique Flight Identifier).
Optional activities include the usage of SWIM B2B services for the exchange of updated route planning during the execution of the flight between AU, DCB and ANSP.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.2 topic b).
Consortia applying for this topic must include at least one AU, and may include additional entities provided their role in supporting the demonstration from the AU perspective is adequately justified in the proposal.
SESAR will reach out to its existing network of international partners. In addition an active contribution is expected from the participating parties by using their own global network to expand the community of international partners participating to the SESAR FF-ICE/1 global demonstrations. To demonstrate such active contribution, a letter of intent of non-European partners of consortium members for participation to the global demonstration, could be included in project proposals, bearing in mind that the non-European partner’s effort is not eligible for funding through this call. This approach is similar to the approach used in the SESAR SWIM Global Demonstration 2016.
This demonstration will not only serve as a demonstration, but also serve as a validation of effectiveness of the global interoperability aspects of the ICAO FF-ICE/1 provisions and the supporting FIXM 4.0 elements.
Scope:
The main scenario is to have an AU with or without supporting CFSP (Computer Flight plan Software Provider) submit an eFPL (Extended Flight Plan) as a filing request to the DCB and participating ANSPs and for those ANSPs to respond accordingly, followed, if necessary, by the required update by the AU.
The expected involvement of parties answering to this open call shall be in accordance to the following terms of reference:
Demonstrations will be conducted using pre-operational systems using operational flight data.
Providing and/or consuming the 4DT (4-Dimensional Trajectory), the FSPD (Flight Specific Performance Data) and the GUFI (Globally Unique Flight Identifier) is mandatory.
Optional demonstrations would aim at demonstrating the use of B2B services for post departure route planning update, and providing feedbacks on the management of an updated route along the ATM chain (including Flow Management units, ATC, AOC, pilots)
Participating AUs shall operate outside Europe to one or more regions of one or more international partners of SESAR, and contribute to the demonstration with these intercontinental flights.
The following potential demonstration activities are presented to assist applicants to scope their proposals. However, the list should not be considered prescriptive or exhaustive, and applicants may expand or reorganise the issues as required to present cost-effective demonstrations:
Contribute to and review demonstration approach, operational scenario and technical architecture
Contribute to, review and apply service definitions exchanged through the SWIM registry
Prepare pre-operational systems to support FF-ICE/1 and FIXM 4.0
Participate to the various phases of the dry-runs with international partners
connectivity testing
scenario testing
demonstration dress rehearsal
Conduct and record flights with support of pre-operational systems (in shadow-mode).
Attend one or more global demonstration events, replaying recorded flights and demonstrating pre-operational systems
Provide feedback on lessons learned on all aspects of the demonstrations, including on the FF-ICE provisions and supporting FIXM 4.0.
Expected Impact:
As the SWIM B2B services for FF-ICE/1 are based on the same SWIM Technical Infrastructure standards (Yellow Profile) as many other services of the European PCP (Pilot Common Project), the demonstration is expected to accelerate the European uptake of SWIM principles in general, and the European implementation of FF-ICE/1 in particular. The global demonstration will also serve as a validation of the ICAO FF-ICE/1 provisions and the supporting FIXM 4.0 elements, and may therefore result in further refinement of these provisions and supporting information exchange model.
Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan"

This topic addresses the application of specific SESAR solutions to operations by GA and rotorcraft, using non-certified or GA-specific on-board equipment.
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 2.3 topic a).
The SESAR programme is geared mostly towards improving ATM for the commercial air transport sector, mostly operating IFR inside controlled airspace. However, the GA and rotorcraft communities should also be able to benefit from the concepts developed in the SESAR programme which, at the same time, should ease integration of GA and rotorcraft into airspace and airports where the SESAR concepts and technologies are implemented. The challenge of this demonstration is to show how GA and rotorcraft can benefit from concepts and technologies developed within the SESAR programme, and to make recommendations for research, regulation, certification and standardisation.
Scope:
The scope of this topic is to demonstrate the ability of General Aviation and rotorcraft to use and benefit from Solutions and technology developed within the SESAR programme in the following environments:
Flight Planning, including SWIM-based information management and exchange;
Airport/airfield operations, including GNSS procedures and simultaneous non-interfering operations intended to increase access to airports for GA and rotorcraft;
Airborne situation awareness, traffic avoidance, collision avoidance, and airspace avoidance; and
Data link communications, including the airborne exchange of information, such as aeronautical information and meteorological information.
Through live-flying trials, the demonstration will build confidence within the aviation community in the ability of GA aircraft and rotorcraft to operate safely and efficiently in the evolving SESAR environment, while also benefiting from new technology and procedures, through the execution of demonstration flights. To achieve this, it is desirable for consortia to include all necessary stakeholders, such as airspace users, including GA owners/operators, airport operators, industry and ANSPs. Where any stakeholder is not included directly in the consortium, applicants shall show how their involvement will be assured.
The scenarios for the demonstration flights may be based on existing SESAR Solutions, and the plan shall clearly state which elements of which solutions each scenario is intended to demonstrate; it is not necessary for a scenario to cover every element of a chosen Solution. Some Solutions will be more suitable for fixed-wing aircraft, others for rotorcraft, and most for both. The demonstration must include flights by both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, although it is not necessary to demonstrate every scenario for both stakeholder groups. Applicants should demonstrate how the scale and balance of their proposed flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project.
In all cases, the aim is to demonstrate how SESAR Solutions could be applied using actual GA aircraft, fixed-wing and rotary, equipped with non-certified equipment. Simulation can be used to develop the demonstration, but the demonstration itself must be through live flying.
It is not necessary to demonstrate IFR solutions in controlled airspace, but the demonstration must show such operations taking place as if they were able to operate in that environment. For example, where a concept is being demonstrated that would assist IFR operations in controlled airspace, which would normally need certified equipment, the demonstration could occur in Class G airspace under VFR, allowing the concept to be flown safely without the need for special authorisations or certification activity.
The following information is presented to assist applicants to scope their proposals. However, the list should not be considered prescriptive or exhaustive, and applicants may select multiple elements of Solutions as required to deliver useful and cost-effective demonstrations, or create new scenarios aimed at demonstrating the use of non-certified technology to bring benefits to the GA and rotorcraft communities.
Full details of the SESAR Solutions can be found on the SESAR web site[1] or in the Solutions Catalogue[2]. As a guide, it is considered that the following solutions seem to be particularly suited to this demonstration activity:
Solution 62: P-RNAV in a complex terminal airspace;
Solution 09: Enhanced terminal operations with RNP transition to ILS/GLS;
Solution 51: Enhanced terminal operations with RNP transition to LPV;
Solution 103: Approach procedures with vertical guidance;
Solution 37: Extended flight plan;
Solution 34: Digital integrated briefing; and
Solution 113: Low-level IFR routes.
Note that Solution 113 is under development and is, at the time of writing, not yet published. Its scope is as follows:
Low-level IFR routes could provide a consistent path for navigation to and away from the departure and approach phases. Design requirements are already defined by ICAO in the PBN Manual (Doc 9613): RNP 1 in general and RNP 0.3 where necessary (constraining environment). New low-level routes are based on RNP 0.3 specification, that is for helicopters and low-speed aircraft only. According to the PBN Manual, the RNP 0.3 Navigation specification has been defined primarily for helicopter applications (e.g low-level routes). Dedicated rotorcraft routes will not only increase airspace capacity, but will improve safety, equity and accessibility in the TMA. Furthermore, the management of particular helicopter characteristics could be done with more efficiency and predictability than before. Routes are totally IFR compliant and guarantee a high degree of safety and flyability in relation to altitudes (decreasing the possibility to encounter icing condition), better separation among other rotorcraft or low speed aircraft, and separation and terrain-avoidance by design is assured inside controlled airspace.
In addition, elements of the following solutions could be demonstrated to show applicability of relevant technology to GA:
Solution 101: Improved hybrid surveillance (ADS-B in for ATSAW);
Solution 65: User-preferred routing (demonstrating the ability of GA to route plan and fly using non-published waypoints); and
Solution 110: ADS-B surveillance of aircraft in flight and on the surface (use of ADS-B to provide ANSPs with improved information of GA activity, for example to reduce airspace infringements or to alert in case of runway incursions, etc).
Applicants are also encouraged to propose innovative GA and/or rotorcraft-specific applications of the technologies used in SESAR Solutions.
Conclusions and recommendations concerning safety, regulation and certification shall address what would be necessary for live operations, not simply for one-off demonstrations. Safety conclusions shall include an analysis of human elements, such as distraction or information-overload from the introduction of new technologies and displays into the GA cockpit, and recommendations for addressing such conclusions shall be made.
The demonstration activities shall cover the full demonstration lifecycle. This includes development of the concept of the demonstrations, participation in periodic meetings, production of all the documentation related to the demonstration (most notably including the demonstration plan and the demonstration report), and results dissemination and communication activities. The demonstration report shall include a full analysis by each participating stakeholder of the impact of the demonstrated concept on performance within their sphere of operations.
Participating stakeholders shall make available data from their flights for the operational evaluation of the performance of the concepts under demonstration.
Expected Impact:
The demonstration will produce evidence that can be used to support regulation, standardisation and certification. Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan. This will support the development of GA and rotorcraft-specific technologies. By doing this, GA and rotorcraft operations should become safer and more efficient, as well as being able to integrate more freely with commercial aviation at a wider range of airports and airspace environments.

In the future, mobility as a service will improve inter-modality connecting many modes of transport into seamless door-to-door services for people and goods. This evolution, amongst others, envisages operations in congested areas and opens the door to alternative responses to the increasing transportation demand in large cities. Urban air mobility (UAM) features flying taxis operating at low and very low level in suburban and urban areas, starting at present with vehicles such as manned helicopters and moving naturally towards more automated operations, alternative propulsion and new vehicle designs.
Scope:
Urban Air Mobility (UAM) refers to the provision of mobility services in an urban environment using air vehicles. These vehicles encompass everything from manned helicopters, as currently flown, through small inspection and delivery drones to ‘flying taxis’, with or without a pilot. As this important and growing domain evolves, it is clear that new operational concepts, regulations and standards will be needed, underpinned by existing and new technologies. The whole environment will need to integrate safely with manned aviation and air traffic control.

In today’s situation Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) usually host a monolithic ATM system in each Air Traffic System Unit (ATSU) with very few information services and infrastructure elements being shared between the different centres. In the virtual centre approach, the controller working positions are decoupled and may even be geographically separated from the ATM information services that they consume, and these ATM information services may be shared between different ATSUs or even between ANSPs. The main benefits expected from the virtual centre approach are cost reduction and more flexibility to support load-balancing between the participating ATSUs, delegation of airspace or manage contingency situations. The development of technical services and common interfaces resulting from new technologies, working methods, and service oriented architectures (SOA) and procedures would also need to address human factors considerations.
Scope:
The Virtual Centre concept consists of an innovative Virtual Centre architecture between a Virtual Centre ATSU and ATM Data Service Provider (ADSP), enabling that a volume of airspace can be controlled by one ATSU or another, e.g. depending on the availability of resources, or in order to provide service in the case of contingency. This topic addresses the automation and digitalisation concepts as referred to in the AAS as the ‘capacity-on-demand’ service. The topic covers:
ATFCM aspects of airspace delegation amongst ATSUs, making it possible for two neighbouring ATSUs (including ATSUs within the same ANSP) that can deliver service over the same volume of airspace to have a common cross-border rostering scheme. FMP support tools will consider the availability of ATCOs at any given time in both ATSUs when proposing a change of sectorization. This topic should also investigate the cross-border use of the Dynamic Airspace Configurations (DAC) concept. The objective is to make it possible to apply the DAC concept in a volume of airspace that is partly controlled by one ATSU and partly controlled by another ATSU, thereby increasing the number of potential configuration.
The topic shall also develop the required technical infrastructure to support the validation activities planned to be performed by Wave 2 solution PJ.10-W2-93 on the ATC aspects of airspace delegation amongst ATSUs and the validation activities required on the ATFCM aspects of airspace delegation amongst ATSUs.
Expected Impact:
The solutions under the scope of this topic are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
The Virtual Centre Concept helps dynamically adapting to changes in capacity e.g. in case of contingency in an ATSU;
Cost-efficiency thanks to the interoperability between system and the decoupling of the ATM data provision from the ATC service provision enabling data to be shared between different ATSUs."

This topic aims at performing demonstration activities for identifying quick-win solutions enabling the safe integration of drones, in all kinds of airspace. Overall, these activities pursue a threefold goal:
To ascertain the fitness for purpose of those solutions in delivering the required services to the user community;
To contribute to and support the parallel prototype regulatory process for drones placed under the aegis of EASA;
To provide inputs to the concurrent standardisation processes both in the identification of perceived needs for standards.
Special emphasis is to be allocated to those applications perceived as the largest market segments within a maximum 5-8 year horizon or less, for example long-range surveying, light-load movement and long-endurance surveying, whose scope can be outlined as follows:
Long-range surveying covers the use of drones in the inspection of infrastructure such as oil, power and railway lines, or area surveillance for agricultural applications.
Light-load movement addresses the use of small drones at VLL for logistic services – e.g. the delivery of packages to the door-step.
Long-endurance surveying focuses on surveillance for extended periods of time, using larger drones, operating at low, medium and high altitudes.
This call should also be framed in the context of the recent “Warsaw Declaration” which acknowledged the need for urgent action on the airspace dimension, in particular the development of solutions for low level operations (“U-Space”).
With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work area 2.3 topic b).
The breadth of applicability of many types of drone in the marketplace is extensive and it is clear that drones will operate in all classes of airspace with a varying degree of interaction with other airspace users. Reconciling this multiplicity of applications, together with the diversity of their associated service, operational and technical requirements, with the over-arching goal of guaranteeing safety, is a challenge of significant complexity. These demonstrations should be designed to provide a significant contribution to effectively tackle such a challenge in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner.
Taking into consideration the accelerated pace of evolution of the drone industry, it is imperative to seek for fast-track approaches that rely on available concepts and technologies capable of achieving the objectives in hand. The aim is to reduce the lead-time to market for new solutions in order to avoid that their unavailability could become a major barrier to further development of the drone industry.
New approaches to procedure development, safety management, standardisation and regulation should be explored to enable expeditious deployment of these new technologies. Such approaches must be ultimately compatible with EASA’s evolving regulatory framework for drones and relate to on-going standardisation activities.
Scope:
The demonstrations should aim at a proof-of-concept for drones traffic management operating within a representative service environment. This concept could combine different applications, with preference being given to those referred to above. This shall be achieved by live flying demonstrations of appropriate drones in an environment permitting the objectives of the project to be met.
It is likely that VLL drone operations will require an entirely new mechanism for managing them, and this is known as Unmanned aerial system Traffic Management (UTM), and such demonstrations shall support its development. VLL demonstrations should cover, in particular, the following core functionality of a UTM implementation:
E-identification and registration;
Surveillance and tracking;
Automatic flight permissions; and
Flight plan validation.
The aim will be ultimately to subsequently extend such functionalities towards Dynamic Airspace Management which is to be backed by a robust geo-fencing capability. Work contributing to the development of the latter is equally within the scope of this call. Demonstrations related to geo-fencing, shall include notably the following set of functionalities:
Drone location surveillance and tracking;
Monitoring of compliance of the drone operation with relevant rules and regulations;
Generation and management of no-fly zones based on aeronautical information (including NOTAMs) and aviation regulations;
Generation and management of no-fly zones for non-aeronautical reasons by appropriate agencies;
Generation and management of no-fly zones that become active while the drone is in flight;
Prevention of the drone from flying inside the defined no-fly zones, including those that change during flight.
A web-based platform should be considered to implement and manage the service; such platform should enable the connection of remote-pilot stations and the sharing of information with authorised external agencies.
The mix of different service applications that serve as the operational scenarios for these demonstrations should be representative of future drone traffic in a blend of rural, suburban and urban locations. In particular:
For long-range surveying the operational context may be VLL, VFR or IFR, and will primarily be BVLOS. There will be some degree of integration with other airspace users, inside and outside controlled airspace. Particular attention should be given to Detect and Avoid (D&A), communications with Air Traffic Control and any issues associated with separation provision for drones inside controlled airspace due to their dissimilar performance characteristics from manned aircraft.
For light-load movement the operational context will normally be BVLOS, fleet-oriented and potentially including some level of autonomy. Although such drones will operate below the levels of most conventional aerial activity, some degree of integration will be necessary.
For long-endurance surveying the operational context builds upon BVLOS. Although such operations can take place at all levels, including in airspace operated intensively by commercial aviation, the focus of this demonstration should be on the VLL environment.
Where applicable, the demonstration should address the required interfaces with Air Traffic Control. It should also cover the associated organisation concepts, the requirements for the scale-up of the demonstration into commercial products, and the identification of gaps – e.g. regulation, standardisation or additional R&D needs – required to enable wide scale implementations. In all cases, the over-arching emphasis of the work should be directed to the support of routine drone operations, not merely restricted to the conduct of trials and demonstrations.
In addition to the core topics described above, the following list proposes areas requiring study in the context of this demonstration. This list should not be considered prescriptive or exhaustive, and applicants may select from, expand or reorganise the issues as required to derive the maximum benefit from the proposed demonstrations:
Detectability of the drone;
Positioning and navigation including European GNSS (Galileo/EGNOS).
Use/management of autonomy;
Flight in accordance with appropriate Flight Rules, covering procedures, terrain/obstacle avoidance, weather avoidance etc.;
Compliance with instructions from ATC and interaction with other ground agencies as appropriate;
Communication;
Data link issues, including performance, protection, failure procedures and spectrum management;
Information management;
Security issues (including cybersecurity);
Operation of multiple drones by one operator; and
Human factors.
The demonstration activities should include:
the concept of operations that is to underpin the demonstration;
the high-level system architecture supporting its implementation, including notably potential interfaces with Air Traffic Control to suit operations inside controlled airspace;
the envelope of functional capabilities and the operational performance of the system set against the requirements associated to selected operational environment; this encompasses specifically information exchange, D&A and data communications, including the Command and Control link;
the requirements for the scale-up of the demonstration into commercial products;
the operational risk analysis;
the associated organisation concepts – e.g. functional role of different stakeholders in the whole value chain, elected business models, staffing including pilot competence issues, governance schemes – that are essential for a well-functioning service market to evolve and reach fruition;
the identification of gaps - e.g. regulation, standardisation or additional R&D needs – deemed required to enable subsequent fully-fledged commercial implementations.
The demonstrations have to be backed by an appropriate project management structure that is centred on timely delivery, including notably robust quality and risk management. This together with a sound result dissemination strategy that is fit-for-purpose of ensuring the widest and most effective utilisation of the results obtained.
Expected Impact:
The demonstrations will produce evidence to back “Quick Wins” solutions for the safe integration of drones in all classes of airspace with a particular emphasis on VLL operations, providing adequate responses to the urgent needs put forward by regulatory authorities and the drone stakeholder community at large."

The current ATM environment based on static flight plans is evolving towards a Trajectory Based environment in order to improve Airports and ATM Network performance. Airspace Users’ (AU) decision processes and resulting business priorities differ from AU to AU and from flight to flight within one AU. The trajectory development and management processes in ATM currently do not allow each individual user to incorporate specific aircraft/flight priorities into the requested trajectory, and respect any constraint in a way that best meets the business priorities. Similarly, OAT flight plans are not harmonised at European level and information is not disseminated into the Network, this induces a lack of awareness about military traffic intentions that can impact ATM Network performance (including safety), and a lack of flexibility in the definition of cross-borders exercises and limitations in terms of interoperability. Irregular operations impose unplanned/additional cost on airlines and have a huge impact on airlines’ annual costs and revenue. Today the ATM system allows little flexibility to Airspace Users (e.g. ATFM slot swapping process).Airspace Users’ full participation through their Flight Operations Centres (FOC/WOC) into ATM Collaborative Processes, including flights’ prioritisation with the full Used Driven Prioritisation process (UDPP), is essential to minimise impacts of deteriorated operations for all stakeholders including AUs. A better recovery process that should offer more flexibility to accommodate AUs’ changing business priorities and equity in the ATM system The collaborative planning and flight execution processes shall be performed at “level playing field”, i.e. performance of all actors is taken into. Rules must be implemented in case no collaborative planning is possible.
Scope:
The project “Optimised Airspace Users Operations” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Airspace Users’ Processes for Trajectory Definition: development of FOC related processes for the management of the Shared Business Trajectory to achieve the full integration of FOCs in the ATM Network processes, increase FOCs role with regard to the Trajectory Management in future ATM and Investigate the impact of such integration on all concerned ATM actors performance.
Airspace Users’ Fleet Prioritisation and Preferences (UDPP) development of the processes, methods and tools by which AUs can indicate their prioritization requests and to share Preferences with the other ATM stakeholders in Capacity Constrained Situations (CCS) and also in circumstances when there is no demand capacity imbalance.
Mission Trajectory Driven Processes Development requirements, procedures and workflows for WOC to interact with other ATM stakeholders to accommodate individual Military AU’s needs and priorities without compromising optimum ATM system outcome and the performances of all stakeholders, through a full integration of the WOC within the ATM system.
Airspace Users’ Trajectory Execution from FOC perspective: Development of FOC related processes, requirements and workflows for the management of the Reference Business Trajectory to ensure continuity in the CDM process throughout the trajectory life-cycle.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Increased Flexibility by allowing the Airspace Users to recommend to the Network Management function a priority order for flights.
Environmental Sustainability - Fuel Efficiency.
Increased punctuality and predictability of individual flights

Today, Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM), Airspace Management (ASM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) are separated processes and the interfaces between ATFCM, ASM and ATC processes and systems require further integration, as well as full collaboration between ATM Actors and Airspace Users. This full integration is currently constrained by the available technology and limited tools, but especially by the limitations of the processes based on ATM operational environment, causing a lack of situational awareness and resulting in sub-optimal use of ATM resources. The traffic prediction does not allow determining appropriate Airspace Design, and the efficient application of Flexible Use of Airspace (military and civil coordination). Also, the sharing of airspace information is not optimally adapted to Aircraft Operators (AO) and other Airspace User (AU) processes, which is leading to limited usage of available dynamic configurable airspace. Similarly, the current ATM environment provides neither an accurate prediction of traffic and relevant measurements of its uncertainty nor the sector predicted workload with a confidence index, with which to determine efficient airspace organisation. Without a common situational awareness, simultaneous operations of civil and military users in a Free Route environment with a high complexity level will be problematic.
Scope:
The project “Advanced Airspace Management” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Management of Dynamic Airspace Configurations: development of the process, procedures and tools related to Dynamic Airspace Configuration, supporting Dynamic Mobile Areas of Type 1 and Type 2, through: the activation of Airspace configurations through an integrated collaborative decision making process, at national, sub-regional and regional levels, a seamless and coordinated approach for airspace configurations from planning to execution phases (increasing the Network capability to continuously adapt to demand pattern changes in a free route environment) and ATC sectors configurations adapted to dynamic TMA boundaries and both fixed and dynamic elements.
Dynamic Airspace Configuration supporting moving areas: extend the management of Dynamic Airspace configuration to support moving areas. This includes Dynamic Mobile Areas or DMA of Type 3 as well as moving danger areas.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Capacity: AAM allows a better use of available ATC capacity and a better balancing of ATC workload leading to reduced demand/capacity imbalance.
Cost-effectiveness/Cost of Air Navigation: AAM allows improved ATM resource planning and better use of existing capacities leading to reduced ATC and Airport Capacity costs.
Flight Efficiency: decrease in flight time. Environment: Increased efficiency enabling optimised flight trajectories and profiles with the end result being reduced fuel burn, noise and CO2 emissions
Flexibility: AAM allows increasing the flexibility of airspace configurations to adapt to any change of demand pattern or unexpected change of users trajectory intents.
Participation: AAM enabled by SWIM/NOP should enable stakeholders’ collaborations earlier in the planning phase and facilitate commitment to network performance optimum by making stakeholders’ intentions and actions more transparent.
Cost-effectiveness/Direct cost of NM and of Local Tools : AAM supported by SWIM/NOP Information Platform will contribute to reduce maintenance and development costs for the Network Manager and local service providers by reducing the number of different remote HMI applications (through implementation of one stop shop access) and by streamlining assets through use of uniform service-oriented principles. Local tools will benefit from the provided SWIM services through easy connectivity to NM and by means of a convenient and economical way to exchange information with the Network.
Safety: AAM should ensure that safety standards will not be downgraded enabled by automated support tools and may be improved through an increased common situational awareness at sub-regional and regional levels."

The organisation of resources across Area Control Centres need to be improved as well as the scoping of measures from local level to full network impact assessment, and the promotion of opportunity measures over those with implication on airspace users costs. The operational data shared in the Network Operations Plan (NOP) is still limited (in scope and time horizon), incomplete and insufficient for tactical and operational use. Information regarding Dynamic Airspace Configuration and Airports is limited and not systematically integrated in the NOP. Information regarding Military operations is subject to operational constraints, and the ATM and military networks are not as fully integrated as they could be even considering military secrecy. The operational data does not yet reflect a unique set of real time data to support tactical DCB processes, collaborative decision making and network performance monitoring in the execution phase. The relevant information should be accessible to everyone and distributed in a transparent but cohesive way. System capacity is impacted by insufficient flexibility in the short term DCB phase and the lack of ATC involvement in the DCB process execution. DCB measures are not fully compatible to support Free Route operations in high complexity environment. This rigidity is aggravated by the absence of a single seamless DCB management process that involves airspace users, airport, terminal and en-route nodes and by the lack of automated tools that provide relevant indicators to assess DCB measures and monitor execution against the predicted impact on network performance. The dynamic integration of operational data needs to be expanded to enable tailored real time network performance assessment, to facilitate collaborative DCB processes and to manage adherence to it. Further development of automated tools, for optimisation and monitoring of relevant indicators to assess DCB measures and monitor execution against plans will allow seamless DCB management processes involving Airspace Users, alongside Airport and en-route nodes.
Scope:
PJ.09 “Advanced Demand and Capacity Balancing” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Network Prediction and Performance: shared situation awareness with respect to demand, capacity and performance impacts at Regional, sub-regional and local DCB processes level. Improved traffic and demand forecast based on SBT and the computation of confidence indexes. Enhanced processing based on complexity and workload assessment to improve the accuracy and credibility of the diagnosis and awareness of hotspots. Network Operations monitoring through Network Performance KPA/KPI. Network impact assessment to analyse trade-offs and facilitate collaborative decision making processes
Integrated Local DCB Processes: Core functionality for the Integrated Network ATM Planning (INAP) process through an enhanced Local DCB tool set including: INAP management, ASM integrated into DCB (including Dynamic Airspace Configurations), reconciliation of DCB measures with local complexity management, ATC and Arrival Management.
Collaborative Network Management Functions: Network Management based on transparency, performance targets and agreed control mechanism. Real time visualisation of AOP/NOP evolving planning environment (such as demand pattern and capacity bottlenecks) to support AU and local planning activity. Network Operations planning and execution managed by an agreed set of rules and procedures (including what-if), guiding subsidiary DCB and UDPP measures under consideration of trade-offs and network performance targets. Collaborative 4D constraints management integrates AUs priorities and preferences, reconciliation of DCB measures with Airports, ACCs, AU and NM, relying on the Multiple Constraints Resolver process.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Efficiency through optimised flight trajectories and profiles, reduced fuel burn, noise and emissions
Cost-effectiveness/Cost of Air Navigation: DCB allows improved ATM resource planning and better use of existing capacities leading to reduced ATC and Airport Capacity costs.
Safety: Improved safety in better anticipating and managing potential overloads.
Predictability: the NOP will provide the planned network situation considering all known constraints and time deviation will be managed by anticipating demand/capacity imbalance detection and improving the implementation of solutions as well as managing time accuracy at CTA/CTO
Flexibility: common awareness to all stakeholders through the NOP and access to opportunities in case of late changes in capacity or demand.
Participation: stakeholders’ collaborations earlier in the planning phase and facilitate commitment to network performance optimum by making stakeholders’ intentions and actions more transparent.

With the extension of Arrival Management (AMAN) systems horizons, En-Route sectors are affected by concurrent arrival management strategies due to the overlapping AMAN horizons of several independent Terminal Manoeuvre Areas (TMAs). The interaction between Traffic Synchronisation and Demand-Capacity Balancing (DCB) within the extended horizon needs to be addressed, and potential information integration needs and balancing mechanisms need to be investigated and developed. Complex interacting traffic flows in the TMA (including from/to multiple airports) need to be more actively managed to increase safety and improve fuel efficiency whilst capacity is increased. ATM operations in high density/complexity environments require a constraining TMA route structure that results in sub-optimal performance due to the insufficient accommodation of different climb and descent profiles and the continued necessity to use stepped climbs and descents for some flights. This leads to an increased tactical operation which in turn leads to increased workload, increased fuel consumption, cost for the airspace user and the consequential increase of noise impact and emissions for arriving and departing aircraft. Use of stepped climbs and descents should be reduced at the same time as optimising flights laterally and with appropriate speed management, and optimising the overall Air Traffic Control (ATC) task. Multiple arrival management systems need to ensure a more regular flow of arriving aircraft managed for TMA optimisation as well as runway optimisation. Multiple departure management systems are required to enable a more consistent delivery of departures into the TMA and ultimately to En Route sectors. Improved flows will help to facilitate optimised profiles for aircraft, with dynamic route structures able to provide additional solutions integrated with the management of queues. IFR Rotorcraft operations are constrained to use same approach/departure procedures as fixed wing aircraft and due to their lower speed profiles, runway throughput is very often negatively impacted at busy airports.
Scope:
The Project “Enhanced Arrivals And Departures” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Extended Arrival Management with overlapping AMAN operations and interaction with DCB: Integrates information from multiple arrival management systems operating out to extended range into En-Route sectors with local traffic/sector information and balances the needs of each. Use of SWIM (System Wide Information Management) infrastructure will be required. Addresses the interaction between Traffic Synchronisation and DCB, including the identification of integration needs, and CTA in high density/complexity TMAs.
Use of Arrival and Departure Management Information for Traffic Optimisation within the TMA: Takes advantage of enhanced predicted demand information provided by local Arrival and Departure management systems to identify and resolve complex interacting traffic flows in the TMA and on the runway. A more consistent and manageable delivery of departures through user-definable TMA ‘hotspots’ into the En-Route phase of flight is enabled through automated support to departure metering and assistance tools provide the ability to coordinate complex interacting traffic flows within the TMA.
Dynamic and Enhanced Routes and Airspace: Brings together vertical and lateral profile issues in both the En-route and TMA phases of flight, with a view to creating an end to end optimised profile and ensuring transition between Free Route Airspace and Fixed route airspace, supported by new controller tools and enhanced airborne functionalities. Dynamic terminal airspace accommodates differing traffic and capacity constraints. Fixed SID/STARs are complemented with dynamic departures/arrival routes. Parallel Approach operations are improved through the application of RNP navigation specifications and the development of enhanced ATC procedures. The need for GA/Rotorcraft-specific route types will be investigated.
Airborne Spacing Flight Deck Interval Management.
Enhanced Rotorcraft and GA operations in the TMA: Further develops the Simultaneous Non Interfering (SNI) concept of operations providing procedures
Approach Improvement through Assisted Visual Separation: Assisted Visual Separation (CAVS/CAPP) (CDTI (Cockpit Display of Traffic Information) Assisted Visual Separation / CDTI Assisted Pilot Procedure).

Airspace users (AUs) should have the possibility to plan flight trajectories without reference to a fixed route network or published directs within high & very high-complexity environments. This would provide the AUs with significant opportunities to optimise the impacted flights in line with their individual operator business needs or mission requirements. Controller workload associated with individual trajectory interactions is anticipated to increase within a non-published route airspace environment. A full advanced controller tool set will be required. Demand & Capacity Balancing in both the planning and execution phases will have to evolve to manage the more dynamic environment including Integrated Network Management, extended ATC Planning and Airspace Management processes. Flight Operation Centres (FOC) systems will also need to be developed and integrated with SWIM Infrastructure allowing all Airspace Users to plan and execute the most efficient trajectory. Non-mainline aircraft requirements need to be taken into consideration.

The project “Trajectory Based Free Routing” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Optimized traffic management to enable Free Routing in high and very high complexity environments: airspace users should be able to plan flight trajectories without reference to a fixed route network or published directs within high & very high-complexity environments so they can optimise their associated flights in line with their individual operator business needs or military requirements.
Management of Performance Based Free Routing: application of Free Routing Airspace (FRA) to make available free routing for airspace users below FL310.
Expected Impact:
Improved Predictability: By enabling AUs to plan and fly a trajectory closer to their business needs, Free Routing will improve predictability.
Improved Environmental Sustainability / Flight Efficiency: An enlarged FRA will directly lead to improved fuel efficiency and business/mission effectiveness. Lower fuel consumption for an aircraft in pre-departure & flight phase will allow increasing flight efficiency.
Improved Access and Equity including BA/GA and rotorcraft: making Free Route available in high and very high complexity environment will allow operating Free Route at lower levels and enabling access to a larger number of aircraft type
En-Route Capacity and safety maintained or improved.
As flexibility of airspace is predicted, and availability of airspace is constantly updated, more flights can be handled, and throughput of airspace is increased. Therefore cost effectiveness is increased.

Current operations within continental En-route and TMA airspace are highly tactical with the use of multiple radar vectors and stepped climbs and descents to maintain separation between aircraft in high traffic situations. This leads to less efficient flight profiles and high levels of workload for both ATC and the flight crews. It makes it also very difficult to balance the operators’ requirements in terms of flight efficiency (notably user-preferred trajectories) with the need for overall capacity, safety of the operations and ATC workload. Occasionally, where no further splitting of sectors is possible due to limited controller resources, the sector demand exceeds the available controller capacity resulting in flow restrictions, level-capping and other measures that ensure safety at the expense of flight efficiency and timeliness. Finally, the flight efficiency in oceanic and other En-route areas without radar coverage is negatively affected by applied procedural separation methods frequently resulting in inefficient flight profiles of involved aircraft. Future En-Route and TMA environment is anticipated to be even more loaded and complex, as full business and mission trajectories will be used.
Free route operational environment and mixed mode operations based on RNAV and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) specifications shall be considered. In addition new system functionalities and further steps of automation provide the chance to achieve significant operational benefits with regards to safety, capacity/productivity and cost-efficiency. New ATC tools and the development of new concepts are also required, to allow for different controller team and sector structures to suit various airspace structures like free route, various traffic levels and complexities. Controller productivity needs to be improved with new team organisations in order to decrease ATC related costs.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) that are to operate under VFR or IFR will have to integrate into an environment which is dominated by manned aviation.

High Productivity Controller Team Organisation: New sector team organizations and responsibilities distribution together with associated assistance tools in order to optimise flight profiles, minimise delays, increase ANSP cost efficiencies while taking into account intrinsic uncertainty in the trajectory.
Flight Centred ATC: in En-Route environment where a number of flights are assigned to an ATCO, unconstrained by geographical location, sector or national boundaries.
Collaborative Control: is a concept of operation based on co-ordination by exception rather than co-ordination by procedure, thanks to advanced controller tools.
Improved Performance in the Provision of Separation: in the en-route and TMA operational environments: Vertical and longitudinal separation are ensured by tactical ATC intervention. Assistance tools are enhanced by using: Enhanced ground Trajectory prediction, Extended Predicted Profile, Aircraft derived data, MET data, ASM and mission trajectory data.
Advanced Separation Management: by introducing automation mechanisms integrating additional information (ATC intent, Aircraft intent).

The full integration between Airport and Network Operations has still to be achieved (airport Performance strongly depends on the performance of the Network). Management of predicted airport performance deterioration therefore needs to be aligned with the Network. Collaborative recovery procedures and support tools in coordination with all the relevant ATM stakeholders are required to facilitate the pro-active management of predicted performance deteriorations. Total Airport Demand and Capacity Balancing processes and tools require further integration with the execution tools (Arrivals and Departure Management systems and Advanced Surface Movement Guidance & Control Systems) and resource allocation planning tools (Stand/Gate Allocation Planner). Airport landside/airside performance monitoring and management processes need to be integrated refining as well the turnaround monitoring within the Airport Operations Centre (APOC) in coordination with the Airspace Users. Environmental impacts and all aspects of de-icing are currently not integrated into the planning and execution timeframes of the Airport Operations Plan (AOP). Impact assessment tools available to the APOC need to better integrate information about MET forecast uncertainty. Post-Operations Analysis processes, support tools and reporting capabilities need to be developed.
Scope:
The project shall address the following solutions:
Enhanced Collaborative Airport Performance Planning and Monitoring
Extending the Airport Performance process monitoring to the airport landside and ground access processes that may have an impact on the airside operations in both planning and execution timeframes; Developing rationalised dashboard(s) fed with all landside and airside leading key performance indicators covering Total Airport Management processes; Consolidating the KPI suite ensuring coverage of both landside and airside operations and focusing on leading performance indicators to support pro-active management of ATM related disruptions.
Developing, in association with Airspace Users, a suitable level of turnaround process planning and monitoring within the APOC which would participate in improving operational resilience.
Improving the connection between the airports with the ATM Network and Providing tools supporting recording, enabling timely analysis of specific events and reporting.
Enhanced Collaborative Airport Performance Management

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Some small and remote European cities are highly dependent of local and regional airports for connection purposes, maintaining local business and cargo.. Remote Tower Services (RTS) provide an opportunity for continued operation of airports and rural development. Multiple remote tower operations from a single centre could reduce the amount of Air Traffic Controllers and Flight information Officers (ATCOs/AFISOs) needed to run a single airport. The costs for performing Air Traffic Service (ATS) are high and could be reduced, particularly at low to medium density airports, by provision of Air Traffic Services (ATS) from a remote tower specifically through a highly efficient multi remote tower solution. Various kinds of environments and airports should be controlled at one time, with a mix of complexity, controller workload and type of traffic (VFR- IFR-mix, rotor-fixed wing, special, Remotely Piloted Aircraft).
Technical aspects, such as network quality of service and other resilience/redundancy related issues that are of key importance to the regulatory authorities need to be addressed. Further development of the Controller Working Position (CWP) is required for a module more suitable for a centre with several CWPs. Maintenance cost and support costs can be lowered with standardized equipment compared to the large variety of environments in today’s towers. The remote tower solution could become SWIM-enabled, by using standardised service interfaces for communication between the remote airport, CWPs (in Remote Tower Centre) and other ATM stakeholders such as En-route/Approach ATC, Airport operations and Airspace users.
The focus on maintaining situation awareness becomes an increasingly important factor with multiple remote tower operations. Additional automation functionalities e.g. voice recognition, conflict detection and conflict resolution advisories should be developed in order to gradually increase the operating range of the concept. In some environments the need for enhanced visual surveillance tools might occur, which requires a seamless integration of air/ground multi-sensor tracking and other systems for situational awareness.
There will be a need for effective planning tools in both short term and long term all managed by a supervisor role. The RTMs need also to support these advanced RTCs. This could also include a RTC to RTC coupling transferring responsibility of an airport. The need for the role of an RTC Supervisor and supporting systems need to be defined.
Scope:
The Project “Remote Tower for Multiple Airports” aims at delivering the following SESAR Solutions:
Remotely Provided Air Traffic Service for Multiple Aerodromes: Aerodrome Control Service or Aerodrome Flight Information Service for more than one aerodrome is provided by a single ATCO/AFISO from a remote location, i.e. not from a control tower local to any of the aerodromes. The ATCO (or AFISO) in this facility performs the remote ATS for the concerned aerodromes. It includes further development of the CWP and MET information from multiple airports.
Remotely Provided Air Traffic Services from a Remote Tower Centre with a flexible allocation of aerodromes to Remote Tower Modules: development of RTC supervisor and support systemsand advanced automation functions for a more cost efficient solution, integration of approach for airports connected to the remote centre and connections between RTCs with systems for flow management between remotely connected airports and development of tools and features for a flexible planning of all aerodromes connected to remote tower services.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network, increasing Cost-Effectiveness, and ensuring that Safety and capacity levels are maintained:
Safety (and security) levels are sufficient for the tasks being performed from the remote location. Any issues regarding degradation of Human Performance are either mitigated by adjusted procedures or new system functionalities.
Better cost effectiveness can be reached through large scale operation with co-location of staff, management, training, etc.
The level of requested airspace and runway capacity for the target candidate environments can be provided by the Remote Provision of ATS under normal conditions."

","11 June 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge:European crop production is facing more and more difficulties in remaining competitive in the global market for many reasons. Some of these reasons are the loss of soil fertility and the consequent massive use of expensive external nutrient inputs, notably Nitrogen and Phosphorous, for which European agriculture is almost totally dependent on imported products, or on fertilizers produced with expensive industrial processes, which generates greenhouse gases (GHGs). Therefore, more sustainable crop management strategies are needed to maintain or increase soil fertility. Inappropriate soil and water management and the overuse of external inputs in intensive crop production systems, represent an economic loss for the farmer and a significant burden for the environment and subsequent impact on human health, as they contribute significantly to ground water and surface water pollution, GHGs emissions, the build-up in soil contaminants, such as heavy metals and organic pollutants. Better soil management and optimisation of fertilisers and water are of paramount importance for conciliating the necessary competitiveness and the long-term sustainability of the entire intensive crop production sector in Europe.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following issue (B):
B. [2015] Assessing soil-improving cropping systems
Proposals should assess real benefits that soil-improving cropping systems and agronomic techniques, e.g. precision farming, crop rotations, Conservation agriculture, can bring to European agriculture, as well as to identify and minimise limitations and drawbacks. Benefits may include a more rational use of natural resources, reduced energy needs, decreased GHG and other toxic gas emissions, soil fertility conservation, above and below ground biodiversity conservation and increased productivity. Limitations and drawbacks may include increased weeds, soil pathogens and problems with certain types of crops in relation to climatic conditions. Scientifically supported and field tested evidences of the mentioned beneficial effects of minimally disturbed soil, and no till or low tillage strategies, as well as of drawbacks and methods to minimise them, are needed to promote the adoption of soil-improving systems and techniques by European farmers. Considering the different pedo-climatic conditions and the varieties of cropping systems in Europe, the development of tailor-made soil-improving strategies, techniques and machinery suitable to different farming areas and adapted to different crops and crop systems, should help to overcome the current barriers that prevent their adoption by European farmers.
Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range EUR 7 million for (B) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: Proposals should show how some, or all, of the following impacts will be achieved:
         Improvement of ground and surface water quality.
         Reduction of soil contaminations with toxic compounds and heavy metals.
         Conservation of biodiversity and wildlife.
         Improved human health, through the reduced release of pollutants and GHGs.
         Scientific support to relevant EU policies[2]
         Sound scientific evaluation of benefits and drawbacks of soil-improving cropping systems and techniques.
         Reduction of soil erosion and improvement of soil quality and structure  
         Increased European farmers’ competitiveness through the reduction of production costs.
         Reduction of the negative environmental impact of crop production through less soil disturbance, better exploitation of soil biodiversity and functions and more rational use of external inputs, water and natural resource base.

","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
Agriculture is facing major challenges such as the need to improve resource use efficiency, reduce dependency on external inputs and cope with more variable climatic conditions. The farming sector is increasingly expected to produce “more with less” and to move towards more sustainable practices. Breeders need to consider more systematically characteristics that respond to these demands and contribute to crop resilience, particularly to increasing biotic and abiotic stresses. Similarly, criteria and methods for testing the value of cultivation of new varieties need to further evolve to capture better the performance of new varieties in conditions associated with sustainable and more variable farming practices.
Scope:
Proposed work will help to identify crop characteristics and ""sustainability criteria"" that are associated with the capacity of new varieties to yield under more variable conditions and under more sustainable crop management practices (e.g. with regard to the use of fertiliser, water or plant protection products). Work will serve to develop methods and tools to integrate sustainability criteria in the testing and evaluation of new varieties taking into account a range of agro-ecological environments, soil types and on-farm conditions. Furthermore, work will advance the development of field based phenotyping tools and protocols to increase robustness of testing methods and allow better prediction of Gene x Environment interactions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will support the introduction of new varieties that are “fit for purpose” as regards meeting demands for high(er) yields but also to show greater robustness and adaptability to changing conditions, in particular varying levels of biotic and abiotic stresses (including decreasing levels of external inputs). This will benefit the introduction of plant properties that respond to new challenges and demands while also taking into account growers' economic returns. More specifically, activities will contribute to
a better understanding of crop-specific characteristics underpinning efficiency, tolerance and resilience to more challenging climatic and production environments
the development of experimental designs, methodologies and tools to improve capture and prediction of the sustainability profile of new varieties
improving information and recommendations on variety performance available to growers
the use of better adapted and more adaptable varieties
In the longer term, the availability and use of more robust and ""sustainability-proof"" varieties are expected to support changes in agricultural practices, i.e. enable the farming sector to remain productive while using resources and external inputs more efficiently. Results will also boost innovation in the breeding sector through the delivery of new varieties with clearly demonstrable advantages."

Specific challenge: Native and alien pests[1] cause increasing yearly losses to agriculture and forestry and plant production costs. Invasive alien species and new pests and diseases impact negatively on native species (e.g. outcompete), affect food chains, change biodiversity patterns and disrupt terrestrial ecosystems (including inland water bodies) and landscapes, with further impacts on economic and recreational activities. Climate change is expected to favour the permanent establishment of many alien pests and change the distribution of already established pests. The prevention of the entry, establishment and spread of new alien pests is regulated by the Directive 2000/29/EC. More environmental friendly approaches in pest and disease control are sought, in line with the Directive 2009/128/EC. Given the high costs associated with the prevention/controlling of pests and invasive alien species and the reduction of their environmental impacts, there is a need to further develop integrated mechanisms of response measures (practical solutions), ranging from prevention of entry to novel Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following issue (A):
A. [2014] Native and alien pests in agriculture and forestry
Proposals should address threats for both the agricultural (including horticulture) and forestry sectors. A number of native and/or alien pests and invasive alien species causing (or having high potential to cause) significant economic losses, having a large environmental impact and therefore posing a major threat for Europe, should be tackled. Advanced solutions for pests (including weeds) and invasive alien species prevention and management, utilising the latest plant health measures and technologies with biological and integrated approaches should be sought. While the centre of gravity should be R&D activities, the technical and economic feasibility as well as the industrial relevance of the proposed technologies and mechanisms should be proven through relevant demonstration activities. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, proposals are encouraged to include participants established in third countries experiencing the same problems (including trade partners)[2]. Involvement of industry (including SMEs) to translate the finding into marketable products or services is required. Active dissemination towards end-users is expected. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[3].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 7 million for (A) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
The availability of organic seeds and varieties (including cultivars) is an economic and technical challenge for organic producers. It is estimated that more than 95% of organic production is based on crop varieties that were bred for the conventional sector and consequently lack important traits required under organic and low-input production conditions. In general, organic farming requires that crops are adapted to more variable conditions, amongst others by effectively interacting with their environment in terms of plant-plant, plant-pollinators and plant-soil interactions. Significant seed multiplication and breeding efforts are needed to improve the performance of the sector through better suited varieties.
Scope:
Proposals will develop a range of measures to increase the availability of organic seeds and varieties for the organic sector. Work will allow identifying relevant (combinations of) traits suited to organic farming conditions, make better use of genetic resources, test existing varieties for organic production, and initiate breeding programmes in response to identified needs of the sector. Proposed activities will be based on partnerships between the breeding, farming and research sectors and fall under the concept of the multi-actor approach[1]. Particular attention will be given to demonstration, testing and training activities in particular in EU Member States where the organic sector is less developed and has particular needs. The topic is open to all types of organic farming systems (e.g. arable farming, horticulture including aromatic and herbs, fruit trees, grasslands, mixed) in various geographical and pedo-climatic and conditions. Selected projects will be requested to work together closely and link up with (the) project(s) funded under SFS-7-2016 topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will contribute to improving the availability and quality of seeds and varieties suited to the specific conditions of organic farming. They will contribute to:
increased knowledge on relevant traits for organic crop production;
improved access to a wider pool of high-quality seeds, varieties and cultivars for the organic farming sector;
efficient seed multiplication and breeding methods;
the availability of tools and resources for pre-breeding and breeding (including improved genotyping and/or phenotyping capabilities).
In the medium to longer term, activities will help to increase competitiveness of the organic breeding and farming sectors throughout Europe and beyond. They will foster low-input agriculture, sustainability of farming practices and quality of products which meet consumer expectations. Conventional systems will also benefit from varieties which are better adapted to lower resource inputs and are more resilient to variable environmental conditions.

Specific challenge: Genetic diversity in agriculture and forestry - both within and between species - is commonly recognised as a pre-requisite to ensure food security, productivity as well as resilience of crops, forests and animals vis-à-vis biotic and abiotic threats in changing environments.  Widening the genetic basis of crops, forest trees and animals as well as diversifying production is therefore essential. This requires coordinated efforts to enhance conservation, access and use of a wide range of genetic resources conserved in ex-situ and in-situ/on-farm conditions. Local livestock breeds, forest plants and crops are a particularly important source of genetic variation as they are associated with a number of favourable characters such as robustness, adaptation to local – often marginal – conditions or organoleptic and health attributes. They also provide the basis for products with a regional identity for which there is increased consumer interest.

","SME instrument phase 2
","03 March 2014
","17 December 2014","Scope:
Specific Challenge: To remain competitive, limit environmental degradation and optimise the efficient use of resources, the development of more resource-efficient and sustainable food production and processing, throughout the food system, at all scales of business, in a competitive and innovative way is required. Current food production and processing systems, especially in the SME sector, need to be revised and optimised with the aim of achieving a significant reduction in water and energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation, while at the same time improving the efficiency in the use of raw materials, increasing climate resilience and ensuring or improving shelf life, food safety and quality. New competitive eco-innovative processes should be developed, within the framework of a transition towards a more resource-efficient, sustainable circular economy.
Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50,000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of Sustainable Food Security and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research.  For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
 Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge of Sustainable Food Security in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
         The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

","Coordination and support action
","15 October 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There is a need to develop and promote more cost-effective and sustainable Integrated Pest Management (IPM) options which are based on a holistic view of agro-ecosystems. IPM is part of EU legislation promoting the sustainable use of plant protection products (SUD[1]). The various IPM solutions being developed across Europe all differ depending on the crops, the available climate monitoring systems, the underlying knowledge of pest populations, on pedo-climatic conditions and on the agro-ecological environment. IPM decision support systems and models developed as part of national or regional research projects usually only deal with limited aspects of crop production and are validated in regional circumstances. As a consequence, it often remains unclear what the value of such a model/system may be in other parts of Europe and what the impact of climate change could be on the validity of the model. Sharing IPM decision supporting tools at European level therefore has great potential for synergies.
Furthermore, on-farm demonstration of novel IPM tools would boost peer-to-peer learning across Europe and help farmers with daily management practices. The challenge is incorporating IPM into the entire farming system, and searching for synergies that result from taking a holistic approach in shaping farming systems.
Scope:
A. [2018] Decision support systems (RIA)
Activities shall bring together the various individual IPM models and decision support systems into a platform to make them available for a wider range of geographic conditions. This user-friendly system shall be developed based on epidemiological parameters of existing decision support systems and made easily accessible to farmers and local advisers. Most processes (such as pest and disease development, crop growth, water balances, etc.) described in models/decision support systems, need detailed climate data and continuous improvement/updates. Therefore, proposals shall integrate the various local agro-meteorological networks across the EU to make it possible for all models/decision support systems offered on the platform to access and use these weather data. Activities should focus on pests and diseases for which IPM solutions are most urgently needed. The platform should enable country stakeholders such as research centres, producer organisations and advisors to select and adapt the relevant individual models/decision support systems to their specific country/region/crop context and make them available to the farmers concerned. Proposals must use an open-source approach and should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[2] including scientists, farmers, advisors and ICT specialists.
B. [2020] European-wide demonstration farm network (CSA)
Activities shall fuel a European-wide network of IPM demonstration farms, which make a direct link between research and practical farm management, thereby facilitating IPM uptake and knowledge-sharing among advisors and farmers. The network should consist of normal farms where farmers can learn in a peer-to-peer mode from their colleagues. Practical information on the farm techniques should be made readily available to all, using open source and open data management to enable wide and long-term sharing, possibly according to specific typologies and areas. Links with administrative databases (e.g. IACS-LPIS system in Member States) and other data sources (e.g. Copernicus earth observations) should be explored. The project should in particular incentivise the uptake of IPM practices by advisors who are using a holistic farm approach. Organic farming practices could also provide a possible source of inspiration, and forestry may be included. Besides making use of the developed decision support tools under scope A and other monitoring and warning systems, the proposals should also help promoting the variety of other existing IPM practices, comparing emerging new IPM techniques, and covering various diagnostic tools and efficient pest monitoring methods. Organic farming practices may provide a possible source of inspiration, and forestry may be included. Proposals will support the development and European-wide sharing of training modules for farmers and for advisors, including from various national/regional sources and demonstration farm programmes. These training modules should feed into the national Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS)[3]. Projects shall seek synergies with the national or regional EIP networks and EIP Operational Groups, and provide input to and coordinate their strategy with the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group. Proposals may include other IPM issues covered under the SUD such as application equipment, risk communication to society, etc. All collected knowledge should feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by farmers. As many “practice abstracts” prepared in the common EIP-AGRI format should be delivered as possible, including audio-visual material wherever possible. It is strongly recommended to cover as many Member States and regions as possible and to seek synergies with similar activities financed through other sources, e.g. the Common Agricultural Policy. Forestry may also be included. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[4], with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including participation and activation of farmers, farmers' groups and advisors to create co-ownership. In this way, in the long run, results will contribute to more sustainable agriculture by reducing exposure to pesticides of humans and animals, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, drinking water and the food chain.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million for scope A and EUR 6 million for scope B would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities should create added value to existing projects by giving farmers throughout Europe a broader understanding of the existing knowledge on integrated pest management. This will support relevant plant health policies, more specifically the implementation of the SUD[5] by demonstrating that IPM strategies work in a ""real world"" application, and in particular by
helping farmers to incorporate IPM solutions in existing agricultural systems, with a focus on taking into account costs and benefits and interactions / with other aspects of agricultural management, thereby building resilience;
supporting European platforms (such as the one created under scope A) for sharing and further developing IPM decision support systems, covering the various bio-geographical areas of Europe;
broadening and adding value to the partnerships between actors, which are developing cost-effective IPM decision support systems ready for practice;
creating an open European network of IPM demonstration farms in all EU Member States/Associated Countries and regions, sharing data and information with a long term effect available to all, where farmers can learn in a peer-to-peer mode from their colleagues on normal farms;
increasing awareness of the available IPM toolbox and extending the range of applications, including by incentivising the take up of IPM techniques and related advisory tools by holistic oriented advisors in their daily services;
increasing on-farm use of IPM techniques
developing European-wide IPM training for farmers and advisors, with modules adaptable to the regional/national contexts , the various farmers' profiles and advisory services.

","Research and Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
The availability of organic seeds and varieties (including cultivars) is an economic and technical challenge for organic producers. It is estimated that more than 95% of organic production is based on crop varieties that were bred for the conventional sector and consequently lack important traits required under organic and low-input production conditions. In general, organic farming requires that crops are adapted to more variable conditions, amongst others by effectively interacting with their environment in terms of plant-plant, plant-pollinators and plant-soil interactions. Significant seed multiplication and breeding efforts are needed to improve the performance of the sector through better suited varieties.
Scope:
Proposals will develop a range of measures to increase the availability of organic seeds and varieties for the organic sector. Work will allow identifying relevant (combinations of) traits suited to organic farming conditions, make better use of genetic resources, test existing varieties for organic production, and initiate breeding programmes in response to identified needs of the sector. Proposed activities will be based on partnerships between the breeding, farming and research sectors and fall under the concept of the multi-actor approach[1]. Particular attention will be given to demonstration, testing and training activities in particular in EU Member States where the organic sector is less developed and has particular needs. The topic is open to all types of organic farming systems (e.g. arable farming, horticulture including aromatic and herbs, fruit trees, grasslands, mixed) in various geographical and pedo-climatic and conditions. Selected projects will be requested to work together closely and link up with (the) project(s) funded under SFS-7-2016 topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will contribute to improving the availability and quality of seeds and varieties suited to the specific conditions of organic farming. They will contribute to:
increased knowledge on relevant traits for organic crop production;
improved access to a wider pool of high-quality seeds, varieties and cultivars for the organic farming sector;
efficient seed multiplication and breeding methods;
the availability of tools and resources for pre-breeding and breeding (including improved genotyping and/or phenotyping capabilities).
In the medium to longer term, activities will help to increase competitiveness of the organic breeding and farming sectors throughout Europe and beyond. They will foster low-input agriculture, sustainability of farming practices and quality of products which meet consumer expectations. Conventional systems will also benefit from varieties which are better adapted to lower resource inputs and are more resilient to variable environmental conditions.

","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
While increasing focus is placed on the efficiency of animal production, animal production systems also need to be resilient, at both animal and system level. For animals, this resilience needs to apply to their welfare, as well as their health. Systems may make use of local, multipurpose breeds and/or highly productive breeds and the genetic variation within breeds could be used more effectively. Enhancing animals’ ability to overcome endemic and emerging diseases and nutritional, reproductive or environmental challenges will help them stay healthy and productive, i.e. increase their resilience, as a result of being better suited to their living conditions. Progress here will be key to improving resilience traits and other traits that are important for a sustainable livestock sector. The challenge for livestock breeding is to address the need for efficiency and the need for resilience, and to manage trade-offs. To accelerate progress on these issues, it is important to develop improved tools to identify, exploit and measure important genomic and phenotypic characteristics of resilience and efficiency.
Scope:
The research will focus on breeding terrestrial livestock for improved resilience and efficiency. It will target efficiency and resilience related traits and possible links between them (synergies, trade-offs) to address balanced breeding goals in an agro-ecological way. Research activities should assess and exploit the potential of underutilised genetic resources (other breeds, traditional breeds and crossbreeds). The projects should address the wide genetic variation among bovine breeds linking beef cattle over dual-purposed cattle to more specialized dairy cattle and link with other EU initiatives in the cattle dairy sector (scope A, 2016) or small ruminants and/or monogastrics (scope B, 2017).

","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
While increasing focus is placed on the efficiency of animal production, animal production systems also need to be resilient, at both animal and system level. For animals, this resilience needs to apply to their welfare, as well as their health. Systems may make use of local, multipurpose breeds and/or highly productive breeds and the genetic variation within breeds could be used more effectively. Enhancing animals’ ability to overcome endemic and emerging diseases and nutritional, reproductive or environmental challenges will help them stay healthy and productive, i.e. increase their resilience, as a result of being better suited to their living conditions. Progress here will be key to improving resilience traits and other traits that are important for a sustainable livestock sector. The challenge for livestock breeding is to address the need for efficiency and the need for resilience, and to manage trade-offs. To accelerate progress on these issues, it is important to develop improved tools to identify, exploit and measure important genomic and phenotypic characteristics of resilience and efficiency.
Scope:
The research will focus on breeding terrestrial livestock for improved resilience and efficiency. It will target efficiency and resilience related traits and possible links between them (synergies, trade-offs) to address balanced breeding goals in an agro-ecological way. Research activities should assess and exploit the potential of underutilised genetic resources (other breeds, traditional breeds and crossbreeds). The projects should address the wide genetic variation among bovine breeds linking beef cattle over dual-purposed cattle to more specialized dairy cattle and link with other EU initiatives in the cattle dairy sector (scope A, 2016) or small ruminants and/or monogastrics (scope B, 2017).

","Research and Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Pesticides are a crucial input in agriculture used to combat plant pests and diseases and secure quality and yield in plant production. At the same time, concerns are mounting over the effects of plant protection products on the environment, non-target organisms and human health. Consumers and the food chain alike are increasingly demanding food products that are residue-low or residue-free and produced in more sustainable ways. This applies particularly to fruit and vegetables, which are often consumed fresh without prior processing.
Member States and EU policies seek to reduce reliance on pesticides for crop protection through the design and implementation of more integrated approaches and restrictions on the use of several active substances currently used in pesticides. The escalation of evolved resistance is putting further strains on the availability and use of plant protection products. Significant effort is required to develop alternatives to current disease and pest control products. Similarly, a better understand of genetic, evolutionary and agronomic drivers of the evolution of pesticide resistance is required to develop more durable and environmentally sustainable plant protection strategies.
Scope:
Activities will foster the development and testing of new products, tools and strategies for integrated pest and disease management to reduce the use of pesticides in the fruit and vegetable sectors (including herbs and medical plants). Work will improve current cultural practices so as to increase the resilience of fruit and vegetable crops against biotic stresses. It will tackle the development and testing of novel, more sustainable products and tools for their application, taking due account of the potential of nature-based compounds. Activities will enhance knowledge of the mechanisms whereby plants develop resistance and help understand how evolution and spread of resistance lead to control failures across farming systems. Projects should fall under the concept of the ‘multi-actor approach’[1] bringing together contributions from a wide range of stakeholders including research, farming, advisory services, industry as well as consumers and civil society. They should also seek contributions from social and economic sciences to cover the broader economic, social, behavioural and environmental issues associated with the adoption of novel pest management strategies. Gender issues will be addressed as appropriate[2]. Activities should take into account relevant ongoing and/or recent projects, such as funded under the ERA-NET C-IPM.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed activities will broaden the armoury of tools available for integrated pest management in the fruit and vegetable sectors. They will help to:
reduce reliance on plant protection products;
introduce novel products with increased specificity and improved environmental performance (e.g. reduced effects on non-target organisms and natural resources);
decrease residue concentrations in fruit and vegetables;
increase food safety and contribute to human health (consumers and applicators);
support innovations in the field of plant protection.
In the longer-term results will contribute to reducing pesticide residues in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, drinking water and the food chain. They will also strengthen the European fruit and vegetable sectors by supporting productivity and product quality. This is expected to increase consumer trust and fruit and vegetable consumption. Results will support product innovation and the competitiveness of European industries including SMEs.

Specific challenge: Over recent decades, much research on innovative food processing technologies has been carried out with a view to combating pathogens, reducing spoilage and waste, optimising process efficiency, reducing the need for chemical preservatives, improving the functionality of foods, and improving the nutritional and sensorial properties of food responding to the demands of the different consumer niches and markets, also in terms of affordability. However, risks associated with scaling-up have often impeded real-scale demonstration of the viability of innovative solutions, and market failures and barriers have hindered the uptake of promising research and innovation results in novel food processing by industry and in the market. One way of supporting sustainable food security is through demonstration and first application in the market of eco-innovative solutions in sustainable novel food processing.
Scope: Proposals could comprise activities such as prototyping, testing, demonstrating and piloting in a (near to) operational environment, as well as experimental production, all with a view to paving the way for subsequent market replication. Proposals may, possibly, include limited R&D activities. In cases where there are clear market failures or barriers to uptake, proposals could comprise activities such as validating the benefits for the users/buyers of the first application in real life operating conditions, validating technical and economic performance at system level, validating standards, as well as activities to prepare market uptake and ensuring optimal access to and dissemination of results.

","Research and Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Bees (including managed and wild bees, social and solitary bees) are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world, in particular loss of habitats which affects their nutrition, exposure to various chemicals (including an array of agrochemicals) and various pathogens. Stressors do not necessarily act in isolation, but in combination, and their effects in isolation or interactions may differ between geographical areas and be more or less severe in different bee species. Regulatory measures in place and beekeeping or agricultural practices do not currently address or prevent the possible effect of such complex interactions. Understanding interactions of multiple stressors constitutes a major scientific challenge, since testing and control in natural conditions is required. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and how to interpret them to discern trends and understand the biology of a healthy bee population/colony and its interaction with the stress factors is still limited. Previous and on-going EU projects have sought to shed some light in particular areas. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the EU reference laboratory (EURL) for bee health are addressing more focused aspects of a holistic risk assessment of multiple stressors in honeybees in the MUST-B project.
Our ability to understand and mitigate the bee health stressors is still limited and so is our capacity to ensure healthy bee populations, sustainable beekeeping and the provision of adequate pollination services in the EU. To move forward, several research topics still need to be addressed. The assessment of potentially harmful effects of chemicals (e.g. agrochemicals and veterinary medicinal products) or mixtures of chemicals and its interactions with other stressors and the monitoring of bees and pollination services to detect and assess long term effects still needs to be addressed.
Scope:
While developing synergies with ongoing activities at EU level, the research will focus on hazard identification for managed and wild bees, social and solitary bees, focusing mainly on exposure and risk characterisation of mixtures of chemicals for bee health. It will take into account the presence or absence of main pathogens, notably Varroa destructor, Nosema spp, American Foulbrood, DWV, and will develop molecular markers using omics technologies. Moreover, it will also take into account the aspect of nutrition and its interplay with the other two stress factors since it has been shown that quality of diet plays an important role in bee health.
The level of contamination in relevant bee matrices (nectar, pollen, royal jelly and beeswax for social bees) and environmental compartments (e.g. on flowering plants and in the nest of bees, whether managed or wild) will be determined. The driving factors and processes leading to such contamination, and their relative and synergistic contribution to final contamination levels and its impact on bee health will be systematically identified. Data on food intake in bees for exposure assessment by ingestion and to understand their effects versus potential residues on environment should also be generated.
The toxicological effect (whether additive, synergistic or antagonistic) of the most commonly found chemical compounds in agriculture in the EU (e.g. pesticides, veterinary medicinal products, other contaminants) will be investigated. A range of representative bee types (honeybee subspecies and bumblebee and solitary bee species) will be considered. Bees of different life stages (larvae and adults) genders and casts (including queens) will be tested. Adverse (lethal, chronic and sublethal) effects, including potential buffer/compensation effects at colony/population level, will be assessed. Work will include, as necessary, development and validation of relevant test protocols. Data on toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics in bees will be generated. Full dose-response relationships will be made to derive bee toxicological thresholds considering species specific sensitivity distributions. Finally, omics data will be developed and validated in the field to provide further insights on species sensitivity at the molecular level and ultimately to determine markers of chemical and pathogen exposure/effects to be used in monitoring plans.
Projects should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1]. The projects should ensure appropriate dissemination to the breeding and professional sectors and other relevant stakeholders to facilitate uptake of results. There should be cooperation as appropriate with relevant initiatives, e.g. in the context of MUST-B, and other funded projects in this field, e.g. those selected under SFS-28-2017.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Filling gaps of knowledge on hazards, focusing mainly on (chronic and sub) lethal effects of mixtures of chemicals on both healthy and infected bees at population and/or colony levels, while also taking into account the aspect of bee nutrition and its effect on bee health.
Provide science- based protocols for improvement of bee regulatory testing schemes.
Contribute to the consolidation of validated monitoring plans on bee health with the development and use of molecular markers.
Contribute to sustainable pollination and sustainable beekeeping.

Biodiversity and various ecosystems serve agricultural production in many different ways, not all of which are well known. The smart use of these services can make agriculture more sustainable and reduce chemical inputs. The development of agricultural systems that maximise such services requires a ""knowledge leap"" based on advances in various areas of science, from new farming practices to modern technologies. The sustained delivery of these services by semi-natural habitats depends heavily on their botanical composition and spatial configuration and the soil characteristics. Beyond the field and farm level, cooperation between farmers and other actors is required at landscape level. There is a real need for a wide range of data to characterise and benchmark sustainable farming systems under various socio-economic and pedo-climatic conditions in Europe, and to find effective ways of encouraging farmers to adopt them.
Scope:
Proposals will explore the functional role of biodiversity in the delivery of ecosystem services, in particular the spatial and temporal interactions between plants/animals as pollinators and natural enemies of pests. They will help to improve understanding of the factors and mechanisms that govern the delivery of such services, including agricultural management and landscape characteristics. Proposals will study and test approaches to enhancing the performance of the services by the targeted promotion of pollinators and natural enemies of pests through habitat provision and management. Cost effectiveness of these services will be compared with that of other agricultural practices (e.g. use of agrochemicals), including an evaluation of production stability and risk management for farmers and consumer demand. Work will examine synergies and trade-offs between pollination, the natural control of pests and other ecosystem services for agricultural production and environmental objectives. Prototypes of sustainable agro-ecology systems, including organic systems, agro-forestry and permaculture, will be developed from farm to landscape/territorial levels. Work will cover pastoral, arable and horticultural systems and potential forms of interaction and cooperation between these sectors at landscape level.
Proposals should establish a farm-level observatory and knowledge-exchange network on biological control and pollinator services linking with the European Innovation Partnership with a focus on innovative system solutions for short- and long-term needs. Activities will target farming systems and clearly cover all dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic and social). Activities will include the collection of the requisite data to monitor, benchmark and analyse the performance of these farming systems in various respects. Proposals will develop and stratify farm networks reflecting relevant European pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions and involve experimental stations, experimental farms and commercial farms to produce references and identify innovative approaches.
Proposals will use transdisciplinary research methods and should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1], involving the farming sector with a view to generating cross-fertilisation and co-ownership.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. The duration of the projects should take into consideration the need to coordinate and implement of farm networks.
Expected Impact:

improved overall sustainability and innovation capacity of the farming systems;
reduction of the environmental impact: improvement of ground- and surface-water quality, conservation of biodiversity and wildlife, contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation;
strengthened transdisciplinary research and long-lasting implementation of the results obtained through the implementation of the multi-actor approach; and

Genetic resources (GenRes) play a crucial role in agricultural activities and sustainable forest management in Europe. They hold the key to the adaptation of plants and animals to a changing and more variable climate, yet their diversity remains largely underused in current breeding, farming and forest management. Conservation efforts (in-situ, ex-situ) aim to capture, preserve, evaluate and make available a substantial share of these global assets. However, access to resources is often limited by the quality of the material and the information provided by the various conservation sites. With increasing concerns over biodiversity loss and genetic erosion, there is a need to step up collaborative efforts to expand and improve the preservation, evaluation and the use of plant and animal GenRes in farming and forestry.
Scope:
A range of activities implemented by a wide range of stakeholders will seek to enhance management and use of GenRes and implement global commitments in this area. While the focus of activities is on Europe, international resources and activities shall be taken into account.
A. [2018]: Joining forces for GenRes and biodiversity management (CSA)
Activities will provide a framework in which the existing mosaic of European, national/regional structures can join forces to develop and implement ambitious approaches and strategies for the management of crop, forest and animal GenRes. In addition to advancing individual roadmaps, inventories and information tools for crop, forest and animal GenRes, cooperation between the different communities shall foster GenRes conservation within a wider (agro) biodiversity context. Particular care shall be taken to building and widening capacities across Europe and neighbouring countries (including Mediterranean countries), exchanging best practices, harmonising standards as well as sharing resources and data.
B. [2019]: Adding value to plant GenRes (RIA)
Activities will improve processes, tools and know-how associated with a dynamic management and documentation of GenRes collections (both ex-situ and in-situ, as appropriate). They will add value to the preserved germplasm to promote its use in breeding, farming, forestry and by consumers. Work will enable the development and testing of solutions to enhance quality and efficiency of operations and services across collections. Major efforts should go into capturing and characterising the genetic diversity in germplasm and revealing novel information to users. This will include acquiring comprehensive and more precise genotypic and phenotypic information on GenRes material, understanding the connections between the two, how they vary in different environmental contexts and having in place appropriate (bioinformatic) tools for data processing, exchange and visualisation. Due account shall be given to disclosing the potential of less adapted material from genebanks/in-situ conservation sites in relation to valuable traits associated with resilience, adaptability and quality of crops.
Proposals should foresee a task for joint activities with other projects financed under this topic.
C. [2020]: The GenRes-user interface and pre-breeding activities (IA)
Activities will accelerate the mobilization of GenRes from in-situ and/or ex-situ collections to benefit plant breeding and the delivery of new varieties which are better adapted to variable environments and consumer demands. They will tackle the GenRes-user interface, i.e. propose improvements to the information available to users with regard to characteristics of accessions and also to the visualisation of this information. Major resources shall be devoted to pre-breeding activities implemented in close cooperation between public, private and non-for profit sectors. The involvement of SMEs is crucial and will be fostered through targeted calls and financial support to third parties[1]. Due attention shall be given to pre-breeding activities undertaken across Europe ad covering different pedo-climatic regions
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million for sub-topic A, EUR 7 million for sub-topic B and EUR 7 million for sub-topic C would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will enhance the status of genetic resources and increase effectiveness of conservation efforts, in particular in Europe.
In the short to medium term work will:
result in the development and/or implementation of integrated strategies for conservation and use of crop, forest and animal GenRes as well as for wider biodiversity (sub-topic A);
enhance user oriented services provided by networks involved in plant (agriculture and forestry), and animal GenRes management (sub-topic A);
help establishing high quality, harmonised standards for the management and description of GenRes across Europe (and beyond) (sub-topics A and B);
increase the quantity and quality of data in established information systems for crop, forest and animal GenRes (sub-topics A and B);
promote innovative ways of sharing resources and services between genebanks/in-situ conservation sites in Europe and beyond (sub-topics A and B);
develop methods and tools for greater insight into the characteristics and the value of collections (sub-topic B);
create novel services for users within and outside the conservation communities (sub-topic B).
improve tools to display user-friendly information on accessions and their characteristics (scope C)
speed up the introduction of useful characteristics from GenRes into breeding (scope C)
promote the delivery of new varieties which are fit for purpose as regards changing environmental / climatic conditions and consumer demands (scope C)
In the long term activities will allow tapping into the vast potential of GenRes more effectively in order to meet current and future needs of food security, the delivery of non-food products from primary production and support the different functions of forestry.

A range of activities implemented by a wide range of stakeholders will seek to enhance management and use of GenRes and implement global commitments in this area. While the focus of activities is on Europe, international resources and activities shall be taken into account.
A. [2018]: Joining forces for GenRes and biodiversity management (CSA)
Activities will provide a framework in which the existing mosaic of European, national/regional structures can join forces to develop and implement ambitious approaches and strategies for the management of crop, forest and animal GenRes. In addition to advancing individual roadmaps, inventories and information tools for crop, forest and animal GenRes, cooperation between the different communities shall foster GenRes conservation within a wider (agro) biodiversity context. Particular care shall be taken to building and widening capacities across Europe and neighbouring countries (including Mediterranean countries), exchanging best practices, harmonising standards as well as sharing resources and data.
B. [2019]: Adding value to plant GenRes (RIA)
Activities will improve processes, tools and know-how associated with a dynamic management and documentation of GenRes collections (both ex-situ and in-situ, as appropriate). They will add value to the preserved germplasm to promote its use in breeding, farming, forestry and by consumers. Work will enable the development and testing of solutions to enhance quality and efficiency of operations and services across collections. Major efforts should go into capturing and characterising the genetic diversity in germplasm and revealing novel information to users. This will include acquiring comprehensive and more precise genotypic and phenotypic information on GenRes material, understanding the connections between the two, how they vary in different environmental contexts and having in place appropriate (bioinformatic) tools for data processing, exchange and visualisation. Due account shall be given to disclosing the potential of less adapted material from genebanks/in-situ conservation sites in relation to valuable traits associated with resilience, adaptability and quality of crops.
Proposals should foresee a task for joint activities with other projects financed under this topic.
C. [2020]: The GenRes-user interface and pre-breeding activities (IA)
Activities will accelerate the mobilization of GenRes from in-situ and/or ex-situ collections to benefit plant breeding and the delivery of new varieties which are better adapted to variable environments and consumer demands. They will tackle the GenRes-user interface, i.e. propose improvements to the information available to users with regard to characteristics of accessions and also to the visualisation of this information. Major resources shall be devoted to pre-breeding activities implemented in close cooperation between public, private and non-for profit sectors. The involvement of SMEs is crucial and will be fostered through targeted calls and financial support to third parties[1]. Due attention shall be given to pre-breeding activities undertaken across Europe ad covering different pedo-climatic regions
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million for sub-topic A, EUR 7 million for sub-topic B and EUR 7 million for sub-topic C would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will enhance the status of genetic resources and increase effectiveness of conservation efforts, in particular in Europe.
In the short to medium term work will:
result in the development and/or implementation of integrated strategies for conservation and use of crop, forest and animal GenRes as well as for wider biodiversity (sub-topic A);
enhance user oriented services provided by networks involved in plant (agriculture and forestry), and animal GenRes management (sub-topic A);
help establishing high quality, harmonised standards for the management and description of GenRes across Europe (and beyond) (sub-topics A and B);
increase the quantity and quality of data in established information systems for crop, forest and animal GenRes (sub-topics A and B);
promote innovative ways of sharing resources and services between genebanks/in-situ conservation sites in Europe and beyond (sub-topics A and B);
develop methods and tools for greater insight into the characteristics and the value of collections (sub-topic B);
create novel services for users within and outside the conservation communities (sub-topic B).
improve tools to display user-friendly information on accessions and their characteristics (scope C)
speed up the introduction of useful characteristics from GenRes into breeding (scope C)
promote the delivery of new varieties which are fit for purpose as regards changing environmental / climatic conditions and consumer demands (scope C)
In the long term activities will allow tapping into the vast potential of GenRes more effectively in order to meet current and future needs of food security, the delivery of non-food products from primary production and support the different functions of forestry.

","31 October 2017
","11 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Agriculture (including horticulture and other forms of primary production) is increasingly being urged to reduce its dependency on external inputs, lower its environmental footprint and cope with more variable climatic conditions. In this context, plant breeding needs to further evolve and take into account more systematically those characteristics that contribute to crop resilience vis-a-vis biotic and abiotic stresses. This implies that criteria and methods are in place to test the performance of new plant varieties under conditions associated with sustainable and more variable farming practices[1]. Innovations in breeding can be further promoted by increasing the robustness and efficacy of variety testing methods for obtaining marketing authorization and Plant Variety Rights[2].
Scope:
Proposed work will help identify crop characteristics and ""sustainability criteria"" associated with the capacity of new varieties to maintain yield under more variable conditions and under more sustainable crop management practices (e.g. with regard to the use of fertiliser, water or plant protection products). Work shall result in the development of methods and tools to integrate sustainability criteria into performance testing (VCU testing and other performance trials) under a range of agro-ecological environments, soil types and on-farm conditions. In addition, activities will improve precision and speed of methods for DUS testing based on European/international requirements for the marketing and granting of rights for new varieties. Proposals must clearly address the specificities of VCU and DUS testing while exploiting synergies between the two, in particular when advancing field-based phenotyping methods, molecular tools and when setting up databases and reference collections. Consortia are required to tap into the expertise of various sectors – ranging from research, breeding, performance testing networks (including VCU testing), plant variety DUS examination offices to farming (conventional and organic) - to bring together the necessary, multidisciplinary know-how. The work proposed shall address performance (including VCU) and DUS testing in a balanced way and maximise synergies between related activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will support the introduction of new varieties that are “fit for purpose”, i.e. that provide stable and high(er) yields while having an increased capacity for adaptation to varying biotic and abiotic conditions (e.g. mitigating the impacts of climate change. This will help introduce plant traits that respond to new challenges and demands in the conventional and organic sectors, while also taking into account the economic return of growers. More specifically, activities will help:
gain a better understanding of crop-specific characteristics underpinning resource efficiency as well as resilience to more challenging environments;
develop experimental designs, methods and tools to improve performance testing (including VCU) of new varieties for their sustainability profile;
evaluate protocols and increase the range of tools available to European plant variety offices for DUS testing;
support activities of the network of European and national plant variety examination offices;
provide breeders and bodies entrusted with variety testing with more robust selection/testing criteria and tools to predict the performance of genotypes in different pedo-climatic and agronomic conditions;
improve information and recommendations on variety performance available to growers.
Potentially, molecular tools developed under proposed activities will benefit other uses such as the detection of new breeding methods.
In the longer term improved testing methods will promote the marketing and use of more adaptable and sustainable varieties by European farmers.
[1]For the purpose of this topic performance testing - including testing for value for cultivation and use (VCU) - is not limited to important agricultural species. In relation to agricultural species mentioned in the Seed Directives this implies that the term ""performance testing"" should be understood as equal to testing the VCU.
[2]Distinctiveness, Uniformity and Stability (DUS) are legal requirements for authorisation of marketing of new varieties of agricultural, fruit and vegetable species in the EU. They are also applied for granting Plant Variety Rights to breeders to protect their innovations. Varieties belonging to important agricultural species (for food and feed) can be marketed on the Common market only if – in addition to the DUS requirements - they exhibit a significant value of cultural use (VCU)."

","Research and Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Permanent grasslands are associated with high biodiversity and the delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services (e.g. carbon sequestration, water quality, flood and erosion control). Permanent grassland is closely linked to the competitiveness of ruminant-based farming systems, but its maintenance is under threat, especially in areas where intensified farming systems or practices are feasible, but also in remote and high-mountain areas where it may be abandoned. Whether natural, semi-natural or agriculturally improved, long-term grasslands provide more ecosystem goods and services than short-term grasslands. The continuity and permanence of grasslands is key to ensuring the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. There is an urgent need to recognise and add value to the multiple ecological functions of grasslands. In turn, this requires the generation of a wide range of data to characterise and benchmark sustainable farming systems based on permanent grassland, taking into consideration the various socio-economic and pedo-climatic conditions in Europe.
Scope:
Proposals should develop integrated approaches for permanent grassland management which are cost-effective, environmentally sound and easily manageable. Synergies and trade-offs between productivity, biodiversity and continuity of the delivery of ecosystem services will be analysed in different contexts of intensification. Projects will develop farm-level decision support tools for the management of permanent grassland so as to enhance biomass production (for ruminant and/or innovative uses and markets) and the delivery of ecosystem services to society. Aspects of livestock health and welfare shall be given due consideration.
Activities will include the collection of relevant data to monitor, benchmark and analyse the performance of farming systems in terms of productivity, carbon sequestration, socio-economics, biodiversity and the delivery of ecosystem services. Proposals will develop and stratify farm networks reflecting relevant European pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions and involve experimental stations, experimental farms and commercial farms to produce references and identify innovative approaches. Proposals could possibly use instrumented farm platforms to compare different forms of grassland management in order to determine the value of permanent grasslands as providers of food and other ecosystem services. Projects are expected to cover both conventional and organic sectors.
On the basis of the farm network output, work will help in the assessment of the effect of various grassland policies on biodiversity and delivery of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration. Taking into consideration the importance and the diversity of grasslands in Europe, this policy analysis could also be extended to relevant third countries. Innovative approaches to creating, maintaining and restoring permanent grassland should be proposed at the appropriate territorial scale. Proposals should develop agri-environmental indicators (including soil carbon content) on grasslands and grassland-based systems as a basis for better recognition of the ecosystem goods and services that permanent grasslands can provide.
Proposals will use transdisciplinary research methods and should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1], involving the farming sector with a view to generating cross-fertilisation and co-ownership.
Proposals should ensure that the grassland classification and performance benchmarks proposed can be made compatible with, and/or improve, the information systems and procedures set up to monitor direct payments[2] to help bridge the semantic gap between the Agriculture and Environment domains and to facilitate monitoring and reporting synergies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. The duration of the project should take into consideration the need to coordinate and implement farm networks.
Expected Impact:
benchmarking of grassland outputs based on local and regional site conditions across Europe;
provision of farm-level tools for the management of permanent grasslands taking into account environmental, economic and social dimensions;
enhanced cooperation and knowledge exchange;
improved policy instruments for the conservation of biodiversity and delivery of identified ecosystem services and climate action provided by permanent grasslands and appropriate incentives to reduce conflict between productivity objectives in primary production, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and the delivery of such services;
integrated scientific support for relevant EU policies (e.g. CAP, WFD, CC objectives);
strengthening of transdisciplinary research and long-lasting implementation of the results obtained through the implementation of the multi-actor approach.

Genetic resources (GenRes) play a crucial role in agricultural activities and sustainable forest management in Europe. They hold the key to the adaptation of plants and animals to a changing and more variable climate, yet their diversity remains largely underused in current breeding, farming and forest management.

","SME instrument phase 2
","03 March 2014
","17 December 2014","Scope:
Specific Challenge: SMEs play a crucial role in developing resource-efficient, cost-effective and affordable technology solutions to decarbonise and make more efficient the energy system in a sustainable way. They are expected to strongly contribute to all challenges outlined in the legal base of the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge ‘Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy’[1], in particular with regard to
Reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint by smart and sustainable use (including energy-efficient products and services as well as ‘Smart Cities and Communities’),
Low-cost, low-carbon electricity supply (including renewable energy as well as CCS and re-use),
Alternative fuels and mobile energy sources,
A single, smart European electricity grid,
New knowledge and technologies, and
Robust decision making and public engagement.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenges outlined in the legal base of the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge ‘Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy’ and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research.  For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
 Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenges outlined in the legal base of the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge ‘Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy’ in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Climate change is among one of the threats for the future capacity of agriculture to cope with increased demands on food production. This challenge can be addressed, among other options, by changes in land and soil management at the farm level. There is a strong direct link between the soil management and a significant contribution of agriculture sector to climate change mitigation and adaptation (i.e. outcome of the COP21, 4 per 1000 initiative, links to SDGs). There is a strong need to develop synergies on research in this area at EU and global level. The results of this activity should contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation debate and consider the ongoing work on Sustainable Development Goals implementation.
Scope:
Proposals should cover the topic of soil carbon sequestration and its links with climate change mitigation from the perspective of agricultural sector. Other areas to be tackled should include land (use) management within the scope of this topic. Participation of initiatives such as the Global Research Alliance (GRA), the Joint Programming Initiative on Sustainable Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE) or the 4 per 1000 initiative is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improved understanding of agricultural soil carbon sequestration in different pedo-climatic conditions.
International Research Community on agricultural soil strengthened
Provide the basis for a more structured approach towards the issue, for instance with the establishment of on International Research Consortium (IRC).

","Coordination and support action
","04 October 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
All major policy developments in the areas of agriculture, sustainable management of natural resources, food or climate change involve impact assessments which are (partly) based on quantitative analysis and projections delivered by models. In the last decades, policies have had to widen the scope of their main objectives to take account of new challenges such as climate change. In addition, policymakers expect that new issues of interest – e.g. working of supply chains – can be informed by model outputs. It is considered that, to bridge the gap between the expectations of policymakers and the capacity of models in a more complex environment, setting up a modelling platform is necessary.
Scope:
The modelling platform will allow to better understand the functioning of the EU Agricultural Sector at different spatial scales (Member States, regions, farm types, grid, etc.), various agricultural activities, be capable of simulating existing and potential agricultural policies, adoption of technologies, bilateral trade, etc. Other areas to be tackled by the platform will include linkages with land use, low carbon economy and climate change, sustainable development goals and linking agricultural production to upstream and downstream sectors. The platform will include several existing models and serve as a forum for model improvement, linking and development and for foresighting in the area of modelling. The platform will be open to relevant entities from outside the EU.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improved capacity of current models to deliver on an increasing variety of policy objectives
Research community on modelling strengthened
Exploration of future directions for modelling"

","SME instrument phase 1
","26 November 2015
","09 November 2017","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to provide support to a large set of high risk innovative Startups and SMEs in the ICT sector. Focus will be on companies proposing disruptive ICT concepts, products and services applying new sets of rules, values and models which ultimately create new markets (e.g. by tackling non consumption) or disrupt existing markets.
The objective of the ODI is threefold:
1. Nurture promising innovative and disruptive ideas;
2. Support their prototyping, validation and demonstration in real world conditions;
3. Help for wider deployment or market uptake.
Proposed projects should have a potential for disruptive innovation and fast market up-take. In particular it will be interesting for entrepreneurs and young innovative SMEs, including start-ups that are looking for swift support to their innovative ideas.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[1],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[2]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [4]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[5] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impacts should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).
Cross-cutting Priorities:
SME Instrument
[1]This is not limited to the costs of acquiring and enforcing European or international IPR titles but could include auditing and risk management schemes to protect IP assets across planned supply and distribution chains and more generally IP valorisation plans to enhance return on investment and lever commercial investment into the relevant project.

Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[2]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [4]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[5] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impacts should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).
Cross-cutting Priorities:

The large numbers of SMEs characterising the EU industrial biotechnology sector are playing a crucial role in the move to competitive and sustainable biotechnology-based processes. These SMEs are characterised by their research intensity and long lead times between early technological development and market introduction. They therefore need to be supported to overcome the so-called “valley of death”. SMEs working in the field of industrial biotechnology and ideas/concepts involving the use of systems and/or synthetic biology are particularly invited to apply for funding.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[1],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Progressive replacement of fossil fuels used in the heat and power sectors by means of renewable energy sources can increase energy security, energy price stability as well as independence from imported sources. However, to unlock the full potential of renewable heat and power solutions to significantly contribute to the energy system, improvement of individual technologies performance and their incorporation into the energy system is needed.
Scope:
Proposals will address one of the following sub-topics:
Biomass based combined heat and power (CHP): Demonstration of technically feasible and cost-effective installation of medium to large-scale CHP through retrofitting of existing fossil-fuel driven CHP or power plants, as such plants are already integrated in the energy grid. Project will address the transformation of existing fossil fuel power plants >10 MW electrical to CHP plants with the use of sustainable biomass feedstock. Transformations have to demonstrate their overall cost benefits over new biomass-based CHP installations and show at least their state-of-the-art requirements for continuous operation and prove advances in combustion emission reduction. Commercial operation of the plant with biomass after the end of the project is to be envisaged.
Geothermal: Allowing geothermal plants to respond cost-effectively to the heat and to the power demand of the network would facilitate the integration of RES in the energy system. Flexible geothermal units are needed to respond to the demand. In addition, adding heat storage to geothermal plants and/or adding other auxiliary heat sources (e.g. sustainable biomass, solar thermal) to geothermal sources, might be important to increase flexibility and allow for better response to variable heat and power demand. Proposals are expected to propose technologies for either more flexible geothermal plants or more efficient geothermal plants or a combination of these two aspects. Associating other renewable heat sources to geothermal and adding storage is not a necessary condition.
The proposals are expected to bring the technology from TRL 5 to TRL 7-8 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 to 20 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The successful demonstration of the proposed solutions will reduce the cost of combined heat and power generation from renewable sources, making it competitive to alternative fossil fuel based solutions. The proposed solutions are expected to lead to subsequent commercial industrial projects, thus increasing the EU industrial capacity for renewable power and heat generation at a lower installation cost. This will allow decarbonisation of the power and heat sector.

Scope:
Proposals will address one of the following sub-topics:
Offshore wind: Focus will be on the development and validation of new manufacturing, installation and/or operation and maintenance techniques, introduction of new materials. The whole value chain, including dismantling, recycling and retrofitting procedures, will be involved to avoid over-engineering. Issues for improved production will be identified. All aspects of health and environmental impact issues will be taken into account.
Deep geothermal: Focus will be on the demonstration of cost efficient technologies to limit the production of emissions and/or to condense and re-inject gases, Turning the emissions into commercial products could contribute to cost reduction but it is not a necessary condition.
CSP: Focus will be on the demonstration in operational environment of CSP solutions based on novel heat transfer fluids and/or of solutions which make an innovative use of a heat transfer fluid that is already used in other CSP applications.

The EU PV manufacturing industry has faced strong foreign competition in the last years, which has led to a dramatic reduction of its production capacity. The challenge is to develop innovative manufacturing solutions, spanning the entire production chain, that substantially improve competitiveness of the EU PV manufacturing industry and help regain a part of the potentially increasing worldwide PV market, while creating more secure and sustainable supply chains for the EU PV market. This challenge is in line with the priority identified in SET-Plan for an Initiative for Global Leadership in PV[1].
Scope:
Demonstrating manufacturing innovation as well as product innovation for highly performing PV technologies (e.g. crystalline-silicon, thin-film and concentration PV). Innovative solutions will be demonstrated at pilot-line level, showing the potential to be scaled up to GW-size, high-yield-throughput and cost-effective industrial production of high-efficiency cells and modules. Possible examples range from the optimization of one or more steps in the value chain (by e.g. increased automation, laser processing, etc.) to the tailored development of production equipment, to the enhanced durability and/or recyclability of the final product, to the demonstration of production routes for cells and modules based on innovative materials and/or architectures (e.g. perovskite/crystalline-silicon tandem cells).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is the design, development and validation of cost-effective Wave energy convertors that can survive in a harsh and unpredictable ocean environment as the ocean through demand-driven Pre-Commercial Procurement. The challenge is open to proposals seeking to steer wave energy research and development in an effective way at a European level establishing convergence of wave energy technologies and to bring these technologies to the market.
Scope:
In the past years, Member States and the European Commission have been working closely together to use their public resources via previous Ocean ERA-NET Cofund actions but like to reinforce their cooperation to address the challenge through a different funding instrument. In this European PCP action it is the aim to elevate experience with national public procurement approaches at a European level to bring European Wave Energy Research and Development more efficiently into the direction of commercialization.
The proposed action is to be structured along the following phases:
Preparation phase: The participating users/buyers of R&D service should agree on common performance levels and associated specifications for the wave energy systems. The action should introduce the ocean energy phase gate procedure on a European level.
They will plan the research and the design of actions covering a broad variety of issues. The PCP will consist of several building blocks addressing different sub-challenges. The funding of the participating programme owners (national and/or regional) and the European Union will be used for different stages in the wave energy technology development. The results of phase 1 should lead to calls for tenders (for the procurement of R&D services) which focus on clearly identified technologies which contribute to the development of commercial wave energy devices. The procurement should be also open for developers, researcher organisations which are not located in the participating countries/regions.
The expected outcomes at this stage: 1) completed tender documents, 2) signed joint procurement agreement confirming the collaboration modus including the financial commitment of the buyers group and 3) final confirmation of the lead procurer.
Execution stage: The action will take care for the implementation of the Pre-Commercial Procurement and of the PCP contracts. The results will be shared within the European industry to accelerate technology development and the establishment of guidelines and standards to facilitate the transferability of the knowledge creation. The research and specification work should lead to at least 3 prototypes tested in an environment close to expected performance. At the end of the action at least one of the prototypes should be ready for testing in an operational environment at commercial scale.
Proposals have to describe the jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into their mid-to-long term innovation plans, why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs. Activities have to include: (1) networking related to preparation, management and coordination and (2) joint research activities related to the validation of PCP strategy.
The consortium should have at least three legal entities established in different member states or H2020 associated countries. In the consortium the participation of minimum two 'public procurers' is required. Other entities might be considered which can have a clear added value in the preparation and/or execution of the PCP or in coordination and networking activities.
Please see part E of the General Annexes for the specific proposal requirements for PCP actions.
The Commission considers that PCP proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between 15 and 20 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission a selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Convergence of wave energy technologies, acceleration of technology development, proof-of-concept and validation of wave energy technology for the benefit of the wave energy sector and as such improved knowledge transfer.
Pool resources at national and EU levels dedicated to Research and Development and provide effectively a significant developmental boost of wave energy technology.
More effective use of public resources for Research and Demonstration.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Providing sustainable and affordable energy to sub-Saharan Africa is critical to the development of a region that accounts for 13% of the world’s population, but only 4% of its energy demand. Sub-Saharan Africa’s energy resources are more than sufficient to meet its demands, but they are unevenly distributed and under-developed (IEA, 2014).
Building local capacities and promoting research, including applied research, are recognized to be essential pillars in the development of sustainable energy in Africa. Africa-EU research cooperation in this area can contribute substantially to further technology take-up in the region. It can also strengthen the market position of involved European institutions through increased knowledge and competitive capacity.
Several initiatives in the past decade have launched support projects aiming to promote research addressing African energy challenges. The participation of African researchers in related calls has however remained limited. African scientists and researchers in general are underrepresented in the international arena: there are only few scientific publications or patent applications related to renewable energy, and limited participation in international conferences. In addition to the limited exposure the international scientific community, limited research capacities both in the sense of human capital and financial resources hinder better representation of African researchers in abovementioned funding schemes.
Following the EU commitments under the Paris Agreement, Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development and Cotonou Agreement, research and innovation cooperation in the field of renewable energy generation technologies between EU and Africa needs to be strengthened and further developed. Coordination of the existing bilateral activities between European and African countries is advisable. The challenge is bringing together the national funding agencies of EU member states and African states interested in developing joint research activities between the two continents to create synergies and to push forward common research and innovation cooperation in the field of renewable energy generations.
Scope:
The proposal will be the preparatory step towards the action to be supported under topic LC-SC3-JA-5-2020. The consortium has to bring together the core relevant European funding agencies and African partners already involved research and innovation cooperation actions.
The fields of activities to be programmed will cover the research and development of new or the adaptation of renewable energy generation technologies to the African environmental, social and economic conditions, of providing affordable access to renewable energy and of improving the innovation cycles.
The objectives will be the development a common strategic joint research and innovation programme on renewable energy technology and to establish its organisational principles that could lead to a Joint Programme. The common strategic joint programme needs to create synergies with existing African-European programmes such as the Africa-EU Energy Partnership, the EU Energy Initiative, the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and the EU-Africa Research and Innovation Partnership.
The estimated duration to achieve these objectives is approximately 12 months.
Expected Impact:
The expected impact will be firstly the achievement of the joint commitments necessary to propose and to implement a Joint Programme, secondly the identifications through its strategic joint programme of the essential research and innovation activities needed to reinforce and to boost European and African research cooperation.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Following the EU commitments under the Paris Agreement, Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development and the Cotonou Agreement, the renewed objective to evolve current forms of cooperation into equal footing partnership between Africa and Europe, the current research and innovation cooperation between Europe and Africa in the field of renewable energy needs to be strengthened and further developed. The challenge is to establish and jointly implement activities that contribute to a mutual beneficial Research and Innovation agenda and its related Research Capacity Building agenda. Through this action EU member states/ Associated Countries and African states interested parties (public and private) will carry out joint research activities between the two continents, will develop synergies and will push forward research capacity building activities in the field of renewable energy production and use, to promote mutual empowerment and to enhance co-designed innovation.
Coordination of the already existing bilateral activities between MSs/ACs and African countries is advisable.
Scope:
The proposal will establish a long term partnership through the implementations of a series of strategic and joint research and innovation actions, and their related research capacity building actions, whose development has been conceptualised and whose essential elements have been so far developed by the project PRE_LEAP_RE http://www.leap-re.eu/ granted under topic LC-SC3-JA-2-2018. The scope of the research activities supported under the long term partnership would include adaptation of renewable energy technologies to the African environmental, social and economic conditions through joint research efforts on renewable energy technologies.
The range of activities supported shall address the broad range elements identified in the preparatory phase and shall include a well-balanced set of research projects, demonstration projects, technology transfer projects, and also include provisions for exchange of researchers between MSs/ACs and African actors. A rolling annual programme of activities will be an annual deliverable detailing the breakdown of activities for each year based on the overall programme of activities. The action might also include financial support to third parties.
It is also expected that the activities proposed under this long term partnership create synergies with existing research, innovation and development programmes.
Inclusiveness of a broad range of MSs/ACs and African partners will be considered an asset. In addition, due to the synergic effect that the coordination of public and private investments and activities can have on accelerating the fast market introduction of innovative solutions, the inclusion in the consortium of private sector stakeholders will be considered a positive asset.
The estimated duration of the project in order to achieve the establishment of the long term and sustainable collaboration is 5 years.
The EU estimates that a EU contribution of 15 million EUR would sufficiently allow the establishment of the intended long term partnership. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.
Expected Impact:
The expected impacts are firstly the creation of long lasting research and development cooperation through common understanding and trust between MSs/ACs and African stakeholders and its related mechanisms,that will be able to continue after the project. Secondly, the contribution to the development of local vibrant research and industrial frameworks, boosting in particular African innovation capacity and significantly improve African stakeholders ability to be included in research and collaboration future networks, improving local innovation capacity. Finally, a strong contribution to the fast development and market introduction of sustainable renewable energy solutions in the African continent.

Supporting the balancing of the power grid and increasing the flexibility of the energy system is possible through dispatchable renewable energy sources, such as for example bioenergy and hydropower. The specific challenge is to increase the potential and performance of dispatchable technologies to provide flexibility services to the energy system by improving their technological characteristics.
Scope:
Proposals will address one of the following sub-topics:
Bioenergy carriers: Development of intermediate bioenergy carriers for energy and transport from biogenic residues and wastes and energy crops from marginal lands not applicable to food or feed production through feedstock flexible technologies at a conversion cost reduced by at least 25% from the state-of-the-art, excluding the feedstock cost, and with increased energy density, storage and trade characteristics, where relevant, and improved GHG performance. The state-of the art for conversion costs per technology will be clearly presented in the proposal with cost figures and versatility of use where appropriate.
Hydropower: Development of low and ultra-low head and sea water resistant equipment (such as for example bulb-pump turbines) guaranteeing at least 70% round-trip efficiency and making low-head seawater storage and other low head applications of hydropower viable, for example at unexplored locations (e.g. like at coastal dams and islands), by minimising at the same time potential impacts on fish.
Virtual Power Plant: Increase the performance of an integrated portfolio of renewable energy sources (namely a combination of variable output and dispatchable renewable sources) to operate together as a Virtual Power Plant, capable of providing flexibility and ancillary services to the energy system. The solution has to be competitive compared with solutions combining variable output renewables with electrochemical storage.
Proposals are expected to bring the technologies from TRL 3-4 to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 5 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The integration of technologies to achieve a 100% share of renewable energy generated and consumed in existing public buildings requires innovative approaches in order to develop efficient and low-cost systems that are easily run by operators and occupants. Furthermore, existing public buildings should be in line with the requirements of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, including national definitions of Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEBs).
This specific challenge targets consortia of procurers with similar procurement needs of common European interest, to drive innovation from the demand side and reduce fragmentation.
Scope:
The objective is to bring radical improvements to the quality and energy performance of existing public buildings by encouraging the development and validation of breakthrough solutions through Pre-Commercial Procurement. Support will be given for developing novel components and configurations to generate in an existing public building energy from renewable sources so that 100% of the energy consumption of the building (electricity, heat and cooling) is fulfilled by means of renewable energy and the yearly energy demand is followed to the largest extent possible. In order to achieve such an ambitious integration of renewable energy, buildings should start from a high level of energy efficiency.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 15 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Please see part E of the General Annexes for a description of the specific requirements for PCP actions.
Expected Impact:
The expected impacts are, on the one side, an effective integration of renewable energy technologies, and on the other side a reduced fragmentation of demand for renewable energy solutions in public buildings. In particular, procurers will be enabled to implement PCPs in areas which - due to their nature - are better addressed jointly, or which they would not have been able to tackle independently.

The specific challenge is to increase the potential of renewable dispatchable technologies in providing flexibility to the energy system. Different technologies are suitable to address this challenge.
Scope:
Proposals will address one of the following sub-topics:
Intermediate bioenergy carriers: Focus will be on the demonstration of the most cost-efficient intermediate bioenergy carrier pathways for energy and transport, which improve the economic viability of the subsequent energy production by addressing solid, liquid and gaseous intermediate bioenergy carriers from biogenic residues and wastes with increased energy density, storage and trade characteristics where relevant. Reduced conversion costs and improved energy efficiency and GHG performance of the intermediate bioenergy carrier pathway will be demonstrated. Production at a scale of up to 5000 tons and process feasibility through applications to fuel production including for the heavy duty, maritime and aviation sectors, as well as to combined heat and power generation, are to be included.
Hydropower: Focus will be on the improvement of the average annual overall efficiency of hydroelectric machinery. Projects are expected to provide high availability of hydropower plants and to maximise performance of hydropower plants of all sizes. The aim is adapting to variable speed generation the hydropower plants (new, refurbished and uprated and especially existing ones); it is important that by optimising maintenance intervals for all hydro plants (especially those delivering balancing power because of the related dynamic operation, dynamic loads and increased wear and tear) the outage time will be minimised. Digitalisation measures to increase the potential of hydropower in providing flexibility to the energy system can be included.
Thermal energy storage in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants: The focus will be on the demonstration of innovative storage systems for CSP plants. The thermal energy storage solutions proposed will have to achieve much higher storage densities than current mainstream solutions (i.e. at least two times higher) while guaranteeing similar performance in terms of cycles.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
There is a large potential to integrate substantial shares of renewable energy generation in district heating and/or cooling systems. Innovative approaches are needed to exploit this potential in the different geographical regions of Europe, also considering the options of combining two or more renewable energy technologies and integrating excess heat. The operators and users expect the systems to be reliable and to have limited installation and running costs. This challenge is in line with what identified priorities in the context of the SET-Plan.
Scope:
Support will be given to cost-effective solutions for district heating and/or cooling systems which allow satisfying at least 50% of the energy demand of the system by the use in the district of one or more renewable energy technologies. The integration of sources of otherwise wasted excess heat is in the scope.
The solutions should be demonstrated in real conditions within an operational district heating and/or cooling system.
The consortium is expected to engage operators and final users (in particular if the users need different supply temperatures) so that they can contribute for an optimal and cost-effective design. The requirements of the final users (e.g., in terms of metering) for the day-to-day operation shall be taken into account.
Proposals are expected to bring the technologies to TRL 6 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 15 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A reduced dependency of district heating and/or cooling systems on fossil fuels and reduced greenhouse gas emissions are expected, as well as reduced emissions of air pollutants. Furthermore, the project should improve the attractiveness of ""renewable"" district heating and/or cooling systems, especially in those EU countries where such systems currently have very limited or no application.

Dedicated biofuel production at large scale depends on sustainable land availability that does not compete with other uses. Phytoremediation is a holistic approach that best de-contaminates lands from a vast variety of pollutants. The challenge is to bridge the gap between phytoremediation strategies and clean biofuel production in a sustainable and optimum manner that will overcome the indirect land use change (iLUC) issue for biofuels and restore lands for agricultural uses.
The proposed solution will contribute towards the Mission Innovation Challenge 4[1].
This is a global challenge that calls for international cooperation.
Scope:
Proposals will bridge the gap between phytoremediation strategies and clean liquid biofuel production. They will optimise energy crops for phytoremediation by targeting different classes of known soil pollutants and integrate in the conversion process to biofuels a strategy to extract these pollutants in concentrated form. The overall process will be optimized in terms of cost and sustainability. Pilot-scale, small trials are expected for both clean biofuel production and phytoremediation processes.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), and given the world-wide applicability of this specific challenge, international cooperation is encouraged.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Good agriculture soil management[1] contributes to food security, climate change mitigation/adaptation and ecosystem services. Preserving and increasing fertility of soils, not least through their organic content and water retaining capacity, increases agricultural production. Soils and their carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content are also important for climate change mitigation. A number of good soil management practices have been developed to deal with some of the challenges; however serious knowledge gaps exist, e.g. on the characteristics of soils in various regions of Europe, the factors influencing their fertility functions including their capacity to store carbon, depending on different climate and environment conditions. The European Union is committed to addressing climate change with ambitious targets. An integrated framework for soil research in Europe is required to overcome current fragmentation and unleash the potential of agricultural soils to contribute to climate change mitigation/adaptation, while preserving or increasing agricultural functions.
Scope:
The European Joint Programme will boost soil research with main emphasis on agricultural soil management and its contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The aim is to construct a sustainable framework for an integrated community of research groups working on related aspects of agricultural soil management[2]. The activities should look at how management of agricultural soils can reduce degradation of land and soils (in particular soil erosion and loss of organic matter), preserve and increase fertility of soils and how the processes related to organic content and water retaining capacity can support mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The EJP will evaluate and foster implementation of novel technologies for soil management and carbon sequestration. The aim of the EJP is also to look for synergies between different approaches used in Europe for farm level accounting of emissions and removals from agricultural activities and particularly of carbon storage. In doing so, activities will contribute to improving inventories, measurements, reporting and accounting activities at different scales. Sustainable agricultural productivity and environmental aspects will also be targeted in connection with climate change mitigation and adaptation, so that optimisation of land management is ensured.
The European Joint Programme will include joint programming and execution of research and other joint integrative activities such as education and training (e.g. short-term missions, workshops), knowledge management, access to experimental facilities and databases, including also harmonisation, standardisation. Farmers, landowners and other stakeholders should be included in research activities as appropriate in the spirit with the multi-actor approach[3].
State-of-art technologies for mapping and soil sampling and analysis (physical, chemical and biological parameters) should be explored for wider and simple use at various levels. In return, by e.g. developing new ICT tools, this could help farmers to protect and manage soils in line with current scientific understanding of processes. The EJP should also facilitate sampling and further development of LUCAS[4] –European Soil Database as well support EU contribution to global soil mapping activities.
Participating legal entities must have research funding and/or management responsibilities in the field of agriculture soil management.
The proposal should include a five-year roadmap describing the key priorities and governance processes as well as the first annual work plan.
The acquired knowledge should support policy making in the domain of agricultural soil management and related areas, such as agriculture, climate and environment, and when feasible and appropriate knowledge exchange between science and practice for better agricultural soil management by farmers should be envisaged.
The activities will need to be coordinated as appropriate with other international soil related activities under the United Nations umbrella among them the Global Soil Partnership and more particularly with European Soil Partnership node; with the Global Research Alliance on agricultural greenhouse gases; Horizon 2020 project CIRCASA[5]; 4‰ Initiative: soils for food security and climate; Joint Programming Initiatives (FACCE, CLIMATE); the Belmont Forum and soil activities coordinated by the European Commission Joint Research Centre [6] when relevant and appropriate. The work of the EJP will also support a number of policies: the Common Agricultural Policy, Climate Change related policy and relevant environmental policies, in particular the implementation of the EU Soil Thematic Strategy[7].
Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the aims of this action and, in order to achieve the objectives of the action, the 60 000 EUR threshold provided for in Article 137(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation N°966/2012 and Article 210(a) of the Rules of Application Regulation N°1268/2012 can be exceeded.
Considering the budget available, the scope covered and the potential entities for the EJP, the Commission considers that an EU contribution to a maximum 50% of the total eligible costs of the action or up to 40 million EUR would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
The project will lead to significant long term alignment and implementation of soil-related research strategies and activities at national and EU level by:
fostering understanding of soil management and its influence on climate mitigation and adaptation, sustainable agricultural production and environment;
understanding how soil carbon sequestration can contribute to climate change mitigation at regional level including accounting for carbon;
strengthening scientific capacities and cooperation across Europe including training of young soil scientists;
Supporting harmonised European soil information, including for international reporting;
fostering the uptake of soil management practices which are conducive to climate change adaptation and mitigation;
developing region-specific fertilisation practices considering the local soil, water and pedo-climatic conditions;
In the long term, the programme will strengthen the role of the farming sector as a steward of land and soil resources. It will increase its capacity to adapt to climate change and contribute to mitigation and carbon sequestration.

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Soil continually undergoes development through physical, chemical and biological processes, which include both formation and degradation. Ultimately, it sustains primary production, which is directly related to land management practices and associated soil types. There are several challenges associated with forest soils, such as water availability and erosion, depositions of air pollutants and nitrogen, natural disturbances such as storms, pathogens and wildfires, and impacts of forest practices intensification on compacting, biodiversity and fertility of soils. Forest soils also have a key climate change mitigation dimension, as they contain more carbon than the atmosphere, and improving forest management could decrease emissions, leading to an accumulation of soil carbon stocks. However, they are also subject to the general limitations associated with the LULUCF (land use, land use-change and forestry) sector, such as non-permanence and saturation of carbon stock and the challenges associated with emissions and removals of greenhouse gases (nitrous oxide, methane and CO2). Several sustainable land management practices conducive to enhanced carbon sinks in forest soils are often put forward, such as avoidance of bare soil (including reduced deforestation), close-to-nature forestry including shelterwood cutting, promotion of nitrogen-fixing and mycorrhizal plants/symbionts, etc. However, the full range and limitation of soil-related climate change mitigation avenues are still to be fully understood, let alone put into practice.
Scope:
Proposals shall aim at strengthening the knowledge base of forest soil typology and (micro)biological properties including methodologies for soil analysis. They shall address soil functions in relation to their climate change mitigation capacity given by organic carbon stocks and associated fluxes - representative for the variety of forest ecosystems and production systems in Europe. Specific emphasis in the proposal shall be put on several of the following research areas:
Improved, integrated and harmonised methods for estimation of carbon, nitrogen and base cation stocks and fluxes in soils, in relation to forest management systems/practices, land-use history and their impact on greenhouse gas inventories and the corresponding monitoring framework;
Effects of natural disturbances and associated relief measures on carbon and nitrogen stocks/fluxes, including the vulnerability and the upper ecological limit of the soil organic carbon pool (i.e. saturation);
Effects of forest management practices on soil properties, including microbial diversity and activity, nutrient availability (e.g. C, N, P, K, Mg, Ca), organic matter quality, acidity, etc.;
Effects of drainage, rewetting and other management practices in forest-like wetlands on carbon, nitrogen and base cation stocks and fluxes;
Trade-offs and synergies between microbial activity in the soil organic and mineral layers and other ecosystem services, including functional biodiversity[1]water cycles, etc.
National research institutes and other entities looking into forest soils research and mapping, as well as LULUCF sector of greenhouse gas inventories, are specifically encouraged to take part in the Consortia submitting proposals to this competitive call.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the framework of SDG 3, 13 and 15, the EU's Bioeconomy Strategy 2012/2018, the EU's Forest Strategy 2013, Paris Agreement 2015, LULUCF Regulation 2018, proposals are expected to assess how they will contribute to:
In the short to medium term, improved and harmonised methodologies for estimation of greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector Europe-wide;
In the medium to long term, strengthened knowledge base and capacity for forest managers to adopt sylvicultural techniques and forest management practices conducive to enhanced contribution of the sector to the global climate change mitigation objectives whilst enhancing forest biodiversity, resilience and overall ecosystem service delivery;
In the medium to long term, more sustainable forest management and contribution of the forest-based sector to increasing and diversifying societal demands upon forest-based products and service.

It is well established that current food systems are under pressure due to the compounded effects of population growth, urbanisation, migration, resource scarcity, increasing demand for animal protein, land use change, climate change. Under certain circumstances, higher temperatures and CO2 concentration are leading to enhanced plant growth but often lower quality, with subsequent impact on food value chains. Also, food production systems strongly rely on plant resources for food or feed but also often depend on chemical inputs that could have negative impacts on both the environment and on human and animal health, resulting in lower system resilience and increased societal concerns. A plausible way to tackle the challenges is future proofing those plants' qualities that could serve as a path to increased nutrition security and sustainable food systems. Now the time has come to capitalise on the results of decades of extensive plant research, while strategically moving towards a system approach to food chains.
Scope:
Proposals shall map, assess and prioritise the technologies and methodologies for plant (both terrestrial and aquatic) improvement with a focus on enhancing plant nutrition efficiency and yield, enhancing nutrition and sensory quality, and ensuring environmental protection.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy intensive industries will require a radical transformation of their production processes to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Future low carbon technologies and processes should address fluctuating and extreme conditions, such as high temperature or corrosive environments, materials and components that will need to be able to be sustained. In the same way, they also need to be designed for high-energy performance.
Existing components materials and any combination thereof have however inherent limitations to meeting new extreme conditions. Stress resulting in degradation, corrosion, wear and/or deterioration can in particular lead to reduced plant efficiency even plant shutdowns or entire equipment failures. The challenge is therefore to develop new, or overhaul the performance of, materials and combined components.
Scope:
Proposals should develop and test high performance materials and combined components to withstand extreme and varying conditions that are expected in future processes, and improve their target performance for a long time. The proposals need to consider the following aspects:
Design, including through modelling and artificial intelligence, development, processing and testing of highly innovative materials with improved properties in terms of, e.g., temperature and humidity resistance (corrosion, oxidation, thermal insulation), strength, functionality, weight, etc. and components with graded and protective coatings, yield strength, hardness, and resistance to media relevant for specific industrial application;
Components embedded with sensors to minimise industrial processing conditions constraints;
Significant increase in lifetime of equipment by reducing damage and degradation such as wear and oxidation in high temperature demanding applications of productive processes;
Reduction of environmental impacts in terms of waste management and energy and resource consumption.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
With a view to future processes to be identified, the proposed solutions across value chains should demonstrate at least two out of following three impacts:
Energy efficiency improvement of the target production and/or operation processes of at least 30%;
Reduction of CO2 emissions and resource utilisation by 20%;
Increased lifetime of the equipment by at least 20%.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

","23 September 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: The technologies that will form the backbone of the energy system by 2030 and 2050 are still under development. Promising technologies for energy conversion are being developed at laboratory scale and need to be scaled up in order to demonstrate their potential value in our future energy system. These new technologies should provide more flexibility to the energy system and could help adapting to changing climatic conditions. New knowledge and more efficient and cost-competitive energy technologies, including their supply chains, are required for the long run. It is crucial that these new technologies show evidence of promising developments and do not represent a risk to society. Developments in sectors other than energy may provide ideas, experiences, technology contributions, knowledge, new approaches, innovative materials and skills that are of relevance to the energy sector. Cross-fertilisation could therefore offer mutually beneficial effects.
Scope: Activities will focus on accelerating the development of transformative energy technologies or enabling technologies that have reached TRL2 (please see part G of the General Annexes). The proposals should bring the proposed technology solutions from TRL 2 to TRL 3-4. A multidisciplinary approach bringing expertise from different scientific disciplines and/or different technological sectors (other than energy or within different areas of energy), in order to cross traditional boundaries is expected to bring forward these game-changer technologies. Innovative solutions and their supply chains such as materials and advanced manufacturing will also be supported as long as the application is clearly energy. New approaches to existing technologies with potential for significant improvements in the overall performance are also allowed. Activities should also focus on the early identification and clarification of potential problems (for example environmental, resource efficiency and safety issues), or concerns to society, and on the definition of a targeted and quantified development roadmap. Proposals should also indicate the current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Annex to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the future advances in the TRL of the technology solution proposed to ensure the potential for exploitation.
Novel technology solutions for grid integration, storage – other than integral to the technology solution developed, fuel cells and hydrogen, energy efficiency and smart cities will not be supported under this topic but in the relevant parts of this work programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The results are expected to move the technology to higher TRL and to provide better scientific understanding and guidance enabling the players concerned (e.g. policy makers, regulatory authorities, industry, interest groups representing civil society) to frame strategic choices concerning future energy technologies and to integrate them in the future energy system. It is also expected that new, out-of-the-box or advanced innovative ideas will emerge that will provide new impetus to technology pathways, to new solutions, and to new contributions to the energy challenge in Europe or worldwide.

The specific challenge of this topic is to develop innovative EGNSS based applications. These should lead to low emission (CO2 and air pollutants), safer, more secure, lower cost and higher performance mobility, and transport solutions that respond to the increased mobility needs of people and goods whilst improving transport service continuity.
Scope:
Proposals may be submitted in any of the transport areas or propose a multi-mode approach:
Aviation: EGNSS solutions for modernising and improving air operations and traffic management technologies, addressing Communication, Navigation and Surveillance applications, including unmanned vehicles (e.g. GNSS based PBN and GBAS Cat II/III operations, advanced operations for approach and landing, surveillance and integrated information management, autonomous air vehicles such as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).
Road: EGNSS solutions that reduce traffic, optimise fuel consumption and emissions, fostering cheaper, smarter, safer and greener transportation (e.g. automated and driverless cars, connected cars). EGNSS solutions in policy driven applications (e.g. digital tachograph, eCall), as well as innovative tolling services and leveraging Intelligent Transport Systems.
Maritime: EGNSS solutions that reduce emissions in shipping and increase efficiency, safety, and resilience (e.g. with reference to vessels navigation, traffic management, port operations, autonomous vessels).
Rail: EGNSS for cheaper, smarter, higher performance, safer and emission-efficient solutions (e.g. train signalling and control, contributing to the European Rail Traffic Management System, asset management, passenger and crew services, autonomous trains).
Public Transport: EGNSS for managing the public transport fleet in order to enhance the quality of public transportation reduce operational costs reduce traffic and provide savings in time and fuel.
Multi-mode: EGNSS for efficient, safer, more secure and higher performance solutions for multi-mode transport (e.g. hybridization of location solutions, reliable location sharing approaches between transport systems, convergence of the transport infrastructures).
Proposals should be built on the exploitation of the distinguishing features of EGNOS and Galileo, e.g.:
Multiple-frequencies E1, E5 and E6;
Galileo specific signal modulation, e.g. AltBOC;
Galileo Search and Rescue Service;
Galileo High Accuracy service that will be offered free of charge and Authentication features that will be provided by Galileo, i.e. in the frame of the Open Service authentication (OS NMA);
Accurate absolute and authenticated time synchronization.
Actions should deliver new innovative applications, with commercial
impact and a clear market uptake perspective (a Business Plan is required as part of the proposal). EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies, such as Earth observation satellite communication or other sensors is required to make the application(s) work, this can be included in the scope.
For proposals under this topic:
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate researchers (engineers, scientists, and others) and the promotion of gender balance is also encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships when applicable;
A Business Plan and evidence of user engagement shall be compulsory and shall be provided as part of the proposal, to demonstrate the user need and sustainability of the project.
Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope
of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future"".
Expected Impact:
Foster the EGNSS market uptake in transport. It should build on specific features and differentiators of Galileo and EGNOS, demonstrating the advantage of their use in smart and green mobility.
Contribute to the resource efficient, climate and environmental friendly transport that will be also safe and seamless for the benefit of all citizens, the economy and society.
Encourage market take-up, taking into account infrastructure and regulatory requirements, coordination of multiple actors and projects.

","Coordination and support action
","05 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Copernicus is addressing all domains of the Earth environment, including the atmosphere, the land (including inland waters) and the oceans. The EU environmental programme Copernicus implements six services that benefit significantly from measurements acquired by EO satellites, the so-called Sentinels series. The first generation of Sentinels includes 6 families of satellites (from S1 to S6), each family having 4 members (from A to D) and additional satellites providing complementary measurements to the existing fleet are foreseen in the context of the expansion of the Copernicus programme.
The utility of the large and growing volume of satellite observations and derived data products for operational services is crucially dependent on the proper calibration of the instruments and validation of the products. Global monitoring over extended periods is expected to require even more rigorous inter-calibration in the future.
These routine calibration/validation (cal/val) exercises are required in order to relate the space measurements to internationally recognized standards to ease comparability of satellite measurements taken at different times and locations, by different instruments and to facilitate cross-validation with other types of measurements and model output.
Cal/val activities are a fundamental aspect of the entire Copernicus programme as the essential connection between Space Component, in-situ Component and Services. Data sharing and data exchange principles and processes should be well defined and promoted by the Programme.
The dimension and breadth of such an operational programme calls for a commensurate instrumental support to perform the required cal/val procedures. Such procedures are currently implemented through existing infrastructures, which are strictly tied to individual missions, set up in an ad hoc manner by different agencies and institutions to provide the basic needed support.
The lack of sustainability in the maintenance of the calibration and validation infrastructures is clearly not in balance with the dimension of the Copernicus space component and its ambitions for evolution in future. Often there is a strong dependency on research infrastructures which is not fit-for purpose in the context of an operational Programme such as Copernicus.
Moreover, the lack of sustainability goes along with a lack of a holistic approach, e.g., a minimum set of standard instruments to be operated through optimised sites or ""supersites"", which would in addition enable an economy of scale. Such “supersites” of fiducial reference measurements may have to be domain specific to cover various geophysical media, but also across domains as the case for the atmosphere in particular. Many issues are at stake when setting up a ground-based network of fiducial reference measurements including the need for optimization depending on the foreseen applications.
Scope:
The action should define an innovative and holistic strategy for the cal/val activities for and across all existing and planned Sentinels in an operational perspective to better access to the necessary infrastructure for Fiducial Reference Measurements.
A number of specific questions need to be addressed:
The clear identification of cross-Sentinels calibration requirements (from level 0 to level 1 data) and of validation requirements (from level 1 to level 2 data).
The clear identification of different cal/val sources: e.g. other satellites, on board calibration, in situ networks, regular airborne campaign, ad hoc site characterization with an overview of existing relevant networks, their distribution and current resourcing.
The comparative evaluation of various methodologies including those which are operational and those which are in a pre-operational status, evaluation of the steps needed to bring the latter to an operational level.
The project should design a comprehensive operational approach for medium and long term cal/val strategy for and across all existing and planned Sentinels with a particular focus on:
The definition of appropriate reference networks and gap analysis with respect to existing ones, an assessment of the sustainability and operational status of the existing networks, an assessment of ""interoperability"" needs between networks;
The definition of the characteristics and the location of optimised sites or “Sentinel supersite(s)”, or where necessary of supersite definition per domain (land, atmosphere and ocean);
An evaluation of the direct impact on level 3 products when relevant;
A proposed solution that should be modular and expandable in light of the potential future Sentinels in the context of the Copernicus evolution.
The linkage between EU and non-EU aspects of the networks needs and identifying the necessary non-EU partnerships to prioritise.
The definition of a long-term strategic reference scenario for the implementation of the required infrastructure.
Efforts should be made to establish counterparts and strong linkages with the international community working on issues relating to Calibration and Validation, in particular with the European Space Agency and EUMETSAT and established standards in place through the CEOS Working Group on Cal/Val and Quality Assurance for Earth Observation framework (QA4EO) as well as the operational elements in place through the WMO Global Space-based Inter-calibration System (GSICS).
The project should take into account relevant on-going coordination activities performed by the European Environment Agency (EEA) as the Entity entrusted by the European Commission to coordinate activities within the Copernicus In Situ component.
The project should also propose recommendations and establish a roadmap to develop this innovative “Sentinels cal/val concept” with specific reference to the “Copernicus supersite(s)” definition and their distribution, including considerations on data quality check, harmonization, traceability, distribution and conservation process of related information.
For proposals under this topic:
Involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers and promotion of gender balance is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Consistent approach for the calibration and validation for and across Copernicus Sentinels
Coordination of networks and space agencies and institutions contributing to Copernicus Sentinels cal/val activities

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In the frame of the space strategy and with the willingness to ensure the sustainability and the development of an enhanced capacity for the evolution of the Copernicus programme, several mission concepts are developed to support areas such as agriculture, forest, water resources, climate change, or polar challenges. In addition, the design and evolution of the current generation of Sentinels will have to be prepared to ensure the enhanced continuity of the current Copernicus services. Existing and planned space component capacities will be also potentially available in terms of contributing missions.
Data and product information related to water and hydrological / hydrodynamic processes are already developed or used in several Copernicus services: the global land service, the pan-European and local land service, the emergency service, the climate and the marine monitoring service. Their developments are performed separately and in the specific purpose of each service without considering the global understanding and better representation of the water cycle from regional to global scale.
Additionally, the user requirements process undertaken by the European Commission has also identified many requirements on data and products to water issues (in a broader sense: from water reservoirs to rain, river runoffs, ice or water in soil and groundwater) to support many policies areas: the EU Water Policy - Framework Directive (2000), the Bathing Water Directive (2006), the Flood Risk Directive (2007), but also indirect support to policies related to the Agriculture, inland transport, food security, energy and hydropower that commonly focus on a local-regional scale. The efforts made at international level for water management should also be taken into account, including the UN Water coordination mechanism and the World Bank Water Partnerships. The Sustainable Development Goal no.6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation is fully embedded into this international context.
Those requirements can only be fulfilled by addressing all issues relating to the global water cycle. The coordination and integration of the water monitoring approach should be improved inside the Copernicus land service and along all the other services. The portfolio should be reinforced with the view of monitoring with a better consistency inland waters on and beneath the Earth surface (mapping water storage and water transport processes, as well as hydrodynamic processes, water quality, hydrological cycle, connection with ocean processes, …) providing a real support to policy actors and to decision-makers.
The development, the implementation and eventually the operation of an enhanced European space capacity including possible innovative expansion missions and the enhanced continuity of Sentinels is an opportunity to better address this crosscutting issue.
It will need the involvement of various players: such as National Space Agencies, European and Member States Institutions (e.g Member States’ Water Authorities), International Organisations, the private sector, operators of in-situ measurement stations, and of leading scientific experts in the identified fields such imagery processing, aquatic optics, data fusion and data assimilation of in-situ measurement stations and networks and hydrological / hydrodynamic modelling for different water storage and flux components.
Initiating and consolidating the establishment of this community and thus reaching the critical mass required for addressing such a challenge will need to take into account:
The catalogue of products in the Land component of Copernicus (i.e. High resolution layers with water and wetness layers, riparian areas, water products from the global land service at EU and global scale…);
Current and planned activities led by the Copernicus Programme (space component and services, i.e. land, emergency, climate, marine) for future services;
The relevant H2020 and ESA projects.
Scope:
The main goal is to analyse current and planned EO space capacities together with innovative processing, modelling and computing techniques to reinforce the existing portfolio offered under Copernicus and to propose an integrated approach for a coherent and consistent inland water monitoring system.
A specific attention should be paid to Copernicus core services providing an economy of scale at EU level, how to avoid also duplication of effort between the six services and to support and benefit from the innovation power of the market driven the industry. Through this Copernicus evolution action, specific elements should be addressed:
improved quality of inland water variables with remote sensing at high and very high resolution (spatial, temporal and radiometric) considering specific pre-processing cloud screening and atmospheric correction, providing objective harmonized measured over different water (e.g. with gradients of trophic status, optical properties), water storage and flux components types with methods from regional to global applicability, building on a multi-sensor and sensor-independent approach to retrieve seamless and gap-filled products;
development of high level biogeochemical products, beyond basic variables for water quality and food web modelling or analysis;
development of mixed EO / model approach leading to enhanced key variables with hindcast and forecast features, continuity of altimetry water-levels and water storage consistent between land and ocean, integrative approach of water at atmosphere (e.g. precipitation) combined with land and ocean, water hydrological cycle and its hydrodynamics provided seamlessly along the hydrographic networks, lakes and rivers including the transition from land to ocean;
Development of temporal and change detection approaches based on the analysis of existing times series of satellite observations of inland waters, including water availability, water quality, water storage, water fluxes, temperature, ice conditions of rivers, lakes, basins and coastal areas, including socio-economic data of the catchment area;
Development of innovative methodologies for uncertainties characterisation (including in-situ data and crowd sourcing).
This should result in the assessment, for the long term, of the best mission concept for water with expected performances, combining existing, next generation and expansion missions under study plus in-situ or non-space observation capacities.
Activities should coordinate ongoing efforts, include mutual identification of research and infrastructural gaps, identify a clear delineation between a core service and a downstream application and facilitate a cooperation of further research and development to be undertaken to reach sufficiently mature capacities for an operational integration as a subsequent step.
The coherence between the space component and the service related requirements should be ensured.
For proposals under this topic:
Involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers and promotion of gender balance is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased coverage of EU policies clearly identifying which and how the project would like to address them;
Based on Copernicus services and existing and future Copernicus missions, define a scenario with the use of new operational capacities and to improve the interactions with non-EO communities on the inland water domain.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The specific challenge of this topic is to develop innovative EGNSS based applications. These should lead to low emission (CO2 and air pollutants), safer, more secure, lower cost and higher performance mobility, and transport solutions that respond to the increased mobility needs of people and goods whilst improving transport service continuity.
Scope:
Proposals may be submitted in any of the transport areas or propose a multi-mode approach:
Aviation: EGNSS solutions for modernising and improving air operations and traffic management technologies, addressing Communication, Navigation and Surveillance applications, including unmanned vehicles (e.g. GNSS based PBN and GBAS Cat II/III operations, advanced operations for approach and landing, surveillance and integrated information management, autonomous air vehicles such as Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).
Road: EGNSS solutions that reduce traffic, optimise fuel consumption and emissions, fostering cheaper, smarter, safer and greener transportation (e.g. automated and driverless cars, connected cars). EGNSS solutions in policy driven applications (e.g. digital tachograph, eCall), as well as innovative tolling services and leveraging Intelligent Transport Systems.
Maritime: EGNSS solutions that reduce emissions in shipping and increase efficiency, safety, and resilience (e.g. with reference to vessels navigation, traffic management, port operations, autonomous vessels).
Rail: EGNSS for cheaper, smarter, higher performance, safer and emission-efficient solutions (e.g. train signalling and control, contributing to the European Rail Traffic Management System, asset management, passenger and crew services, autonomous trains).
Public Transport: EGNSS for managing the public transport fleet in order to enhance the quality of public transportation reduce operational costs reduce traffic and provide savings in time and fuel.
Multi-mode: EGNSS for efficient, safer, more secure and higher performance solutions for multi-mode transport (e.g. hybridization of location solutions, reliable location sharing approaches between transport systems, convergence of the transport infrastructures).
Proposals should be built on the exploitation of the distinguishing features of EGNOS and Galileo, e.g.:
Multiple-frequencies E1, E5 and E6;
Galileo specific signal modulation, e.g. AltBOC;
Galileo Search and Rescue Service;
Galileo High Accuracy service that will be offered free of charge and Authentication features that will be provided by Galileo, i.e. in the frame of the Open Service authentication (OS NMA);
Accurate absolute and authenticated time synchronization.
Actions should deliver new innovative applications, with commercial
impact and a clear market uptake perspective (a Business Plan is required as part of the proposal). EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies, such as Earth observation satellite communication or other sensors is required to make the application(s) work, this can be included in the scope.
For proposals under this topic:
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged;
Involvement of post-graduate researchers (engineers, scientists, and others) and the promotion of gender balance is also encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships when applicable;
A Business Plan and evidence of user engagement shall be compulsory and shall be provided as part of the proposal, to demonstrate the user need and sustainability of the project.
Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope
of this action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the Horizon 2020 focus area ""Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future"".
Expected Impact:
Foster the EGNSS market uptake in transport. It should build on specific features and differentiators of Galileo and EGNOS, demonstrating the advantage of their use in smart and green mobility.
Contribute to the resource efficient, climate and environmental friendly transport that will be also safe and seamless for the benefit of all citizens, the economy and society.
Encourage market take-up, taking into account infrastructure and regulatory requirements, coordination of multiple actors and projects.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Demonstration in real user environments are needed in system integration, services, tools, network synchronisation, co-ordination schemes, business models, cost-benefit analyses, market architectures and rules and in regulatory regimes to plan, build, monitor, control and safely operate end-to-end networks which have increased operational flexibility that allow for a cost-effective integration of intermittent distributed generation and active demand. Smart grids and smart metering require the support from an ICT infrastructure with stringent requirements on e.g. availability and low latency. Different options are possible, in particular whether to exploit as much as possible the telecommunication infrastructure and its future developments, or whether to develop specific telecommunication infrastructure to cover parts of the architecture. In both cases, important investments need to be made and cost-effectiveness should be one of the main drivers. There is no conclusive analysis of the various options and whether dual-use of telecommunication networks would allow savings for consumers versus deploying a parallel infrastructure. The challenge also covers synergies with other types of energy networks (gas, and heating or cooling).
Interoperability is critical for a robust and sustainable grid architecture and needs to be demonstrated (e.g. through standards, protocols, regulatory framework).
Scope: Integrating and validating solutions to grid challenges concentrating on field demonstration of system integration. Preparing first replication of the solutions in different contexts and/or cities integrating retail markets, distributed renewable energy, demand response, new business models, advanced ICT. Appropriate market models, business cases, user and general public engagement, regulatory, market up-take, social, environmental and resource efficiency aspects should be included. Opening up demonstration facilities for targeted practice-oriented education and training is encouraged. Life Cycle Analysis and economic assessments should be refined.
Preparing the development of the next generation ICT infrastructure for smart metering and smart grids, analysing capital costs, operational costs, business models and benefits of different options. The analysis has to be done in the context of the present regulatory frameworks (both for energy and telecommunications) in the Member States.
The Innovation Actions should focus on:
Development of ICT tools, and integration and innovative use of ICT for smart grid services to be provided in an open and competitive electricity market. This includes services for next generation distributed renewable energy integration and demand response systems. Particular attention is to be given to new market entrants, including ESCOs, aggregators, etc. and to validation of new business models. The Commission considers that a contribution from the EU in the range of 2.5 to 3 million Euro per proposal would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. It is expected that 3 to 4 proposals could be supported. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Demonstration of innovative solutions (innovative integration of existing technologies into the system) offering services to all actors in the retail markets of the electricity system. The projects should improve medium and low voltage network monitoring and control (intelligent active control, of active/reactive power flows, fault and outage management, automatic control concepts, network synchronisation using for example European GNSS (Galileo) active loads and eventually distributed storage integration) in a secure and economic way. The projects should validate innovative models for local dispatching of distributed generation, and methods and tools for grid asset maintenance and management to mitigate the costs of grid maintenance, replacement and development in the presence of a very large share of renewable generation. The projects should validate distributed renewable energy and demand response systems offering advanced services to all actors in the retail markets of the electricity system (including ESCOs, aggregators, etc.) in order to ensure that all consumers (industry and citizens) will benefit from cheaper prices, more secure, stable grids and low carbon electricity supply. The demand response should be demonstrated in action in the real world, with longer term monitoring in order to validate these new business models. The Commission considers that a contribution from the EU in the range of 9 to 12 million Euro per proposal would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. It is expected that 3 to 4 proposal could be supported. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Deployment of a flexible architecture for smart metering systems decoupling the metrology part from user functionalities and allowing for smart grid functionalities to be added during system exploitation in a plug and play way. Connection to building management systems (BMS), intelligent appliances, local generation and storage shall also be included. The solutions have to be such that the costs for a prosumer (mono-phased meter + end user functionalities + service provisioning) shall not exceed 100 € for large quantities (such as 10.000 orders). The Commission considers that a contribution from the EU in the range of 2.5 to 3 million Euro per proposal would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. It is expected that 3 to 5 proposal could be supported. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
All proposals addressing 1, 2 and 3 shall include a part of market uptake measures accelerating the implementation of new policies, market rules, legislation and/or incentives schemes, various tariffs, which shall reduce the overall costs of supplying renewable electricity to end users. Societal research needs to be integrated into the market uptake part, addressing concerns about data security, public acceptance and ensure that citizens see the clear financial benefit.
The Coordination and Support Action: Support from an appropriate ICT infrastructure with stringent requirements on e.g. availability and low latency is essential for large scale deployment of smart grid and smart metering. Different options are possible, in particular whether to exploit as much as possible the telecommunication infrastructure and its future developments, or whether to develop specific telecommunication infrastructure to cover parts of the architecture. In both cases, important investments need to be made. There is however no conclusive analysis on the various options and on whether dual-use of telecommunication networks would allow savings for consumers versus deploying a parallel infrastructure.  In this context, the Coordination and Support Action[1] focusses on the cost benefit analysis of deployment options for smart grids ICT infrastructure. Elements to be considered are reduction of both capital and operational costs, including also innovative business models and benefits for different actors. The analysis should be done in the context of the present regulatory frameworks (both for energy and telecommunications) in the EU Member States and should examine possible distortions in current compensations and incentives towards the different options. The Commission considers that one proposal with a contribution from the EU in the range of 1 million Euro would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to:
Demonstrate active demand response in real world environments in commercial operation with active involvement of consumers, aggregators, ESCOs, etc. based on new business models
Deliver innovative ICT-based services and tools for even more advanced and high performance solutions
Substantially increase the share of micro-generation and renewable generation within the local grid.
Opening up new markets for advanced grid technologies and system architectures to foster European industries' competitiveness.
Active participation of prosumers, and new players in energy markets.
Mitigating capital and operational costs of the grid modernisation required for the energy transition, and minimising environmental impact, thus ensuring lower electricity prices for all. New benefits shall be generated; these benefits be shared in a fair way between all actors, from aggregators to industrial end-users and citizens.
Better using scarce resources by maximising the up-scaling and replication of lessons learned from demonstration projects in different Member States and by sharing of knowledge and practices.
Accelerating the implementation of new policies, market rules, legislation and/or incentives schemes for smart grids infrastructure
Accelerating the deployment of innovations in the electricity grids to lower the cost of smart metering and smart grids deployment and to respond in a timely way to the challenges facing grid operators and users in view of the agreed 2020 objectives.
Enabling an open market for services deployment.
Developing generic techniques and better using scarce resources by maximising the up-scaling and replication of lessons learned from demonstration projects in different Member States and by sharing of knowledge and practices.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:Regulation 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure identifies the deployment of several transnational electricity grids among the energy infrastructure priority corridors. Its design, development and deployment include technical, financial, management, regulatory and policy viewpoints.
The first commercial HVDC projects have implemented point-to-point connections, point-to-point and multi-terminal deep off-shore grids. Meshed off-shore grids linking several off-shore wind parks with on-shore grids in different countries and with other available generation resources are urgently required to provide additional flexibility, efficiency, security and market access to off-shore wind resources. Its deployment is delayed through a number of barriers: lack of agreement among operators and manufacturers on architectures, control structures and interfaces to ensure interoperability and multi-vendor compatibility of equipment, lack of market rules and revenue streams allowing the build-up of a suitable financial package (combining, innovation actions with European debt instruments and financing coming from other sources, national, regional or local), permitting and environmental compatibility, and operation and management of these grids from legal, technical and market point of view.
In order to achieve full interoperability and coherent market rules at European Level it is encouraged having a wide representation of the Grid stakeholders and operators addressing a complete European approach.
Scope: The proposals should prepare the first phase for deployment of innovative components of interoperable meshed off-shore HVDC network technologies, services and tools architectures. It is expected that the projects will cover TRL6 or 7, bringing them to TRL 8, with a path to TRL9 in follow-up projects (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Initial technology elements leading to meshed off-shore grids shall first be trialled at full scale as additions to planned off-shore projects (cables and hubs). Appropriate mechanisms to cover risks and potential losses to the commercial operation of these underlying projects shall be investigated.
The proposals should be based on the results of the existing projects funded under the Seventh Framework Programme dealing with the development of innovative components of interoperable HVDC network technologies, services and tools architectures or be closely synchronised through active cooperation in order to ensure a seamless transition without gaps in time or technology. The proposers shall deliver in the first phase a detailed study considering the economic viability and then develop a detailed deployment plan for future projects not only in the Northern seas, but in all transnational electricity grids as defined in the regulation 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure.
The proposals should include also a part to develop the appropriate policy, regulatory and financial framework. The project should include a focused and short part to seek agreement among network operators and major equipment suppliers on a technical architecture and on a set of multi-vendor interoperable technologies.
The proposals should further elaborate on finished and running projects on the economics of meshed HVDC off-shore grids through reduction of the typical uncertainties of such economic studies and define possible routes for a reduction of costs and risks.
The project(s) should be seen as a “phase one” project; therefore it should include a compulsory plan that clearly defines all the actions needed to lead towards “phase two” leading to full commercial operation ideally before 2020. Consortia should include a limited number of key partners from manufacturers, TSOs, and renewables operators, and should cooperate also with relevant regulators and authorities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 30 to 40 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to cover all the general impacts listed below:
Accelerating the deployment of meshed HVDC off-shore grids, with particular emphasis on Northern Seas partner countries, before 2020.
Ensuring that the technology will be ready for deployment in other regions in Europe for all transnational corridors defined in the trans-European energy infrastructure regulation, or be compatible (plug-and-play) with other upcoming technologies (e.g. ocean energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, etc. as soon as these technologies are ready for similar capacities).
Ensuring plug-and-play compatibility of all relevant equipment of the key suppliers.
Preparing for corresponding priority infrastructure projects identified under the trans-European energy infrastructure regulation.
Facilitating the efficient connection of off-shore wind resources to on-shore loads and with other available generation resources for balancing, covering the main Northern Seas partner countries.

The increasing share of variable renewable energy sources and the 2020 and 2030 targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emission in the EU are calling for important changes in our energy system: more flexibility, more active involvement of all stakeholders and more collaboration. If no actions are taken, the power system will face several risks such as, poor quality of the electricity supply, congestion, lack of stability, excessive levels or curtailments, impossibility to cope with electro mobility demand, etc. The challenge is therefore to create and deploy common tools for planning, integration and operation across the energy system and its actors.
Scope:
Proposals must target the development of technologies, tools and systems in one or several of the following areas:
Novel European grid and end-to-end energy system planning tools, including foreseeable features such as storage, aggregation, demand-response and integrating cost aspects;
Enhanced TSO / DSO collaboration and coordination tools, secure data exchange across networks along whole the value chain, ICT tools for cross-border trading for nearly real-time balancing; definition of minimum set of specifications to allow automated digital cross-border electricity market;
Solutions for the deployment of neutral data access points ensuring a fair and transparent data access to all energy actors (TSOs, DSOs, ESCOs, Telcos, ICT companies, consumers, etc.); validation of new business models resulting from the cooperation between them; investigation of incentives and possible commercial arrangements with a fair share of benefits across actors;
Synergies between electricity, gas and heat networks, associated business and market mechanisms and analysis of existing regulatory aspects; technologies for hydrogen production and storage are addressed in the frame of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen JU and are therefore excluded from this call;
Socio-economic aspects and environmental aspects related to large scale infrastructures relevant to renewable generation and changes to transmission infrastructure need for their integration; socioeconomic aspects of consumer behaviours in demand-response mechanisms, consumer engagement.
Proposals will demonstrate a good knowledge and compatibility with current regulations, available or emerging standards and interoperability issues applying to their technologies, in particular in connection to ongoing work in the Smart Grid Task Force and its Experts Groups in the field of Standardization (e.g. CEN-CLC-ETSI M/490), regulatory environment for privacy, data protection[1], cyber security, smart grid deployment, infrastructure and industrial policy (http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters/smart-grids-task-force).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately and between EUR 0.5 and 1 million for proposals addressing area 5 only. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In order to ensure the coverage of each area, proposals above all thresholds will be ranked in each of the 5 areas and the first ranked proposals in each area will be selected until the available budget is exhausted (first, all proposals ranked nb 1, then nb 2, etc.); in case of insufficient budget to select all projects of the same rank to cover the 5 areas, the best scores will prevail; in case of equal scores, standard rules do apply.
Expected Impact:
Proposals must demonstrate that they are relevant, compatible with the broad EU energy policy context such as Climate-Energy packages, Energy Union. Where relevant, they should also indicate if and how they will contribute to:
ongoing policy developments in the field of the design of the internal electricity market, of the retail market, ongoing discussions on self-consumption,
enhanced interconnections between Member States and/or between energy networks.
Proposals must demonstrate if and how they contribute to the following impacts.
Optimized grid planning and design at European level, maximizing the capacity of the grid to host variable renewables, take full advantages of a pan-European grid for stability and security
Safe, secure, efficient and coherent data handling, enabling more cross border trading and real time balancing
Enabling new flexibility services to the grid associated with new business opportunities, offering the access to cheaper energy for the consumers and maximising the social welfare
Increasing the potential of exchanges between energy networks, enhanced security of supply, create business opportunities, avoidance of curtailment, offering new services to the grid
Account for human behaviour in the design of infrastructure and demand-response to avoid blockages due to social acceptance, placing the consumer at the center of the energy system.
Finally, proposals will also include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice which could be used to assess the progress during the project life.

The targeted technology readiness levels (TRL) will range typically between 5 and 8 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Proposals will indicate the estimated levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
Proposals will include an analysis of current regulations, codes and standards applying to their case as well as an analysis of business models and pan-European EU market integration if relevant. Where appropriate, environmental issues will be addressed in the light of existing regulations (e.g. water framework directive, Natura 2000, etc.).
Proposal tackling problems of transnational nature will be given specific attention.
Proposals will also foresee coordination with Horizon 2020 funded projects carrying out demonstration in the context of smart grid and storage in particular for policy-relevant issues such as regulatory framework, business models, data management, obstacles to innovation. It is recommended to reserve of the order of 2% of the EU funding for these activities. A Coordination and Support Action is foreseen for the organisation of this collaboration in this Work Programme (see Topic LCE 3)
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 15 and 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals must demonstrate that they are relevant, compatible with the broad EU energy policy context such as Climate-Energy packages, Energy Union. Where relevant, proposal should clearly describe how they will contribute to:
ongoing policy developments in the field of the design of the internal electricity market, of the retail market, ongoing discussions on self-consumption,
enhanced interconnections between Member States and/or between energy networks.
Proposals will demonstrate that the proposed solution can be scaled up to GW or GWh level (if relevant) and replicated, indicating where, how the demonstrated solution could apply with an estimate of the quantities of energy and power involved. Proposals will also describe if and how they contribute to ensure that the EU electricity network:
is capable of integrating large share of renewables (at least 50%[1] by 2030), in particular from variable sources;
can operate in a stable and secure way;
operates within a well-functioning wholesale market, providing the EU consumers with competitive prices of electricity and integrating renewable sources in a cost effective manner;
evolves towards a pan-European network with increased levels of security of resource sharing.
Finally, proposals will also include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice which could be used to assess the progress during the project life.
[1]In the GHG40 EU reference scenario 2014 (medium ambition), the share of renewables in electricity is close to 50%, see 'A policy framework for climate an energy in the period 2020 up to 2050 - Impact Assessment' (SWD(2014)16 final)"

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Demonstration and R&D are needed in interoperable technologies, services, tools, system integration, network synchronisation, co-ordination schemes, business models, cost-benefit analyses, market architectures and rules and regulatory regimes to plan, build, monitor, control and safely operate end-to-end networks across national borders. The integration of renewable energy and emergence of new services and uses of electricity will require major upgrades and reinforcements of the pan-European power system. A realistic implementation of the “smart grids” concept across national borders becomes a requirement to continue the safe operation of the grid.
Scope: Integrating and validating solutions to grid challenges, concentrating on field demonstration of system integration, up-scaling at industrial scale and supporting R&D. Preparing first replication of the solutions in different contexts and/or countries. Appropriate market models, business cases, user and general public acceptance, regulatory, market up-take (e.g. regulatory issues, capacity building and access to finance), social, environmental and resource efficiency aspects should be included. Opening up demonstration facilities for targeted practice-oriented education and training is encouraged. LCA and economic assessments should be refined
The priorities for Innovation Actions are focussed on:
Demonstration and validation of emerging power, transmission and ICT technologies, including e.g. network synchronisation using European GNSS (global navigation satellite system) to increase transmission network flexibility, capacity and operational security (including resilience against disasters).
Demonstration of new approaches to the wholesale electricity markets facilitating the participation of variable renewable energy sources.
Demonstration of integration of active demand response and of variable renewable generation connected at distribution level to operations at distribution and transmission levels.
Market-uptake studies need to be integrated into the demonstration proposals. Potential risk of lock-in effects of early deployment should be taken into account.
Societal research needs to be integrated into the market uptake part. Societal research shall address concerns about data security, public acceptance and ensure that citizens see the clear financial benefit.
Particular priority elements for Research & Innovation Actions include:
Joint modelling and simulation of power systems and the underlying ICT infrastructure.
Interaction between the TSO and DSO, information exchange of RES availability, operational parameters and constraints between transmission and distribution systems.
Methods and tools for emerging transmission technologies to increase transmission network flexibility, capacity and operational security as well as grid asset maintenance and management to mitigate the costs of grid reinforcement, operation, maintenance, replacement, upgrade and development in the presence of very large share of renewable generation, also taking demand response into account.
Advanced architectures and tools for pan-European markets for ancillary services and balancing; Integration of advanced power electronics technologies into subsystems that enhance available network capacity and flexibility.
Selected proposals will be requested to cooperate through regular common workshops, exchange of non-confidential reports, etc. Proposals should address these activities in the description of the work. IPR issues will be fully respected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 12 to 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The proposals are expected to have one or more of the general impacts listed below:
Opening up the deployment of solutions for improving flexibility and available capacity of European electricity grids at high voltage levels to integrate renewable and other new electricity producers and users, while managing power flows or balancing while maintaining or enhancing service quality, reliability and security of the power system.
Demonstrating advanced grid technologies and system architectures and further developing the competitiveness of European industries.
Devising new market architectures and business models, disseminating effective architectures and models across Europe, demonstrating the infrastructures, processes and information management to develop the active participation of demand, and new players (such as aggregators) in energy markets.
Mitigating capital and operational costs of the grid modernisation required for the energy transition, and minimising environmental impact.
Better using scarce resources by maximising the up-scaling and replication of lessons learned from demonstration projects in Europe and by sharing of knowledge and practices.
Better coordination among activities promoted by Member States and at European level.

","05 May 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge:Europe has limited biomass and land resources to cope with an increased demand for fuels and other uses. Thus, in the long-term perspective, new technologies of sustainable biofuels and alternative fuels need to be developed that radically improve the state-of-art, notably in regards to the following sub-challenges:
a)      Improving conversion efficiency and/or enlargement of the biomass feedstock basis.
b)      Developing alternative fuels through use of new and sustainable resources from non-biomass non-fossil sources.
c)      Improving the economic, environmental and social benefits relative to fossil fuels and currently available biofuels, notably regarding cost reduction, minimisation of demand on natural resources (land and water in particular), enhanced energy balance, reduced GHG emissions (including carbon stock changes) and development of rural areas.
Scope: Proposals focusing on the long-term perspective should aim at developing the next wave of alternative and sustainable fuels by moving technologies from TRL 3-4 to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes). In each case, they should address sub-challenge a) or b) and sub-challenge c) described above.
Environment, health and safety issues, regional and social dimension, shall be considered in all developments and appropriately addressed. An assessment of alternative uses of the used feedstocks outside the bioenergy sector should also be done.
Biofuels produced from starch, sugar and oil fractions of food/feed crops are excluded.
An important element will be an increased understanding of risks (whether technological, in business processes, for particular business cases, or otherwise in each area), risk ownership, and possible risk mitigation. Proposals shall therefore include appropriate work packages on this matter.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant performance indicators, expected impacts, as well as provide explicit exploitation plans. Proposals should also indicate the current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Appendix to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the advances in the TRL that will be undertaken in the proposal to ensure the potential for exploitation.
Opening the project's test sites and pilot facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The new developed technology pathways should permit the use of new feedstock sources that do not compete directly or indirectly with food or feed production for resources, or a more efficient conversion of the current ones. A favourable energy balance is expected, as well as a significant potential for cost reduction, which would permit these fuels to eventually compete favourably with fossil or older-generation equivalent fuels. The development of new technologies will permit robust and reliable assessment of the environmental and social benefits with respect to current technologies, notably in terms of GHG performance, energy balance, efficient use of natural resources, decentralised energy production, and job creation in rural areas, as well as secure and affordable energy supply in Europe or worldwide.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:In the short-term and medium-term perspective, due to different issues (such as the limited distribution infrastructure of the electrification option, or the unsuitability of such option for certain transport modes), biofuels are expected to be increasing contributors to the de-carbonisation of the transport sector. In order to achieve the EU targets regarding renewable energy in transport and CO2 abatement (set out in the RES and Fuel Quality Directives), and to address concerns regarding indirect and direct environmental impacts of biofuels, new and advanced biofuels using sustainable feedstock need to reach the market. To this end, the following sub-challenges should be addressed:
Proving that advanced biofuels and bioenergy carriers technologies, as identified in the Implementation Plan of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative (EIBI)[1], are technically viable, environmentally and socially sustainable, and potentially cost-competitive at commercial scale.
Developing logistic systems for a sound, safe and sustainable feedstock supply.
Scope: Proposals should address the medium-term challenges for market penetration of advanced biofuels as presented above. In each case, they should address one of the respective sub-challenges, or a combination of them. They should bring technology solutions to a higher TRL level (please see part G of the General Annexes), in line with the Implementation Plan of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative (EIBI)[2]. Proposals shall aim at moving technologies that reached already TRL 5-6 to TRL 6-7 through industrial demonstration projects[3].
Environment, health and safety issues in the whole life cycle should be considered in all demonstrations and appropriately addressed. An assessment of alternative uses of the used feedstocks outside the bioenergy sector should also be done.
Biofuels produced from starch, sugar and oil fractions of food/feed crops are excluded.
An important element for the entire area of renewables will be an increased understanding of risks (whether technological, in business processes, for particular business cases, or otherwise in each area), risk ownership, and possible risk mitigation. Proposals shall therefore include appropriate work packages on this matter.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators and the expected impacts. Industrial involvement in the consortium and explicit exploitation plans are a prerequisite.
All proposals have to include a work package on the business case of the technology solution being addressed. This work package has to demonstrate the business case of the technology and identify potential issues of public acceptance, market and regulatory barriers, including standardisation needs. It should also address, where appropriate, synergies between new and existing technologies, regional approaches and other socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective. 
The current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Annex to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the advances in the TRL that will be undertaken in the proposal should also be indicated to ensure the potential for exploitation.
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Testing advanced biofuel technologies at large industrial scale reduces the technological risks, paving the way for subsequent first-of-a-kind, commercial-scale industrial demonstration projects. For this purpose, the scale of the proposals should permit obtaining the data and experience required so that a first-of-a-kind, commercial-scale industrial demonstration project can be envisaged as a next step. The industrial concepts demonstrated should have the potential for a significant social and economic impact, notably in terms of job creation, economic growth and safe and affordable energy supply in Europe and beyond.
