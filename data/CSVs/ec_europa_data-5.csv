","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:In the short-term and medium-term perspective, due to different issues (such as the limited distribution infrastructure of the electrification option, or the unsuitability of such option for certain transport modes), biofuels are expected to be increasing contributors to the de-carbonisation of the transport sector. In order to achieve the EU targets regarding renewable energy in transport and CO2 abatement (set out in the RES and Fuel Quality Directives), and to address concerns regarding indirect and direct environmental impacts of biofuels, new and advanced biofuels using sustainable feedstock need to reach the market. To this end, the following sub-challenges should be addressed:
Proving that advanced biofuels and bioenergy carriers technologies, as identified in the Implementation Plan of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative (EIBI)[1], are technically viable, environmentally and socially sustainable, and potentially cost-competitive at commercial scale.
Developing logistic systems for a sound, safe and sustainable feedstock supply.
Scope: Proposals should address the medium-term challenges for market penetration of advanced biofuels as presented above. In each case, they should address one of the respective sub-challenges, or a combination of them. They should bring technology solutions to a higher TRL level (please see part G of the General Annexes), in line with the Implementation Plan of the European Industrial Bioenergy Initiative (EIBI)[2]. Proposals shall aim at moving technologies that reached already TRL 5-6 to TRL 6-7 through industrial demonstration projects[3].
Environment, health and safety issues in the whole life cycle should be considered in all demonstrations and appropriately addressed. An assessment of alternative uses of the used feedstocks outside the bioenergy sector should also be done.
Biofuels produced from starch, sugar and oil fractions of food/feed crops are excluded.
An important element for the entire area of renewables will be an increased understanding of risks (whether technological, in business processes, for particular business cases, or otherwise in each area), risk ownership, and possible risk mitigation. Proposals shall therefore include appropriate work packages on this matter.
Proposals shall explicitly address performance and cost targets together with relevant key performance indicators and the expected impacts. Industrial involvement in the consortium and explicit exploitation plans are a prerequisite.
All proposals have to include a work package on the business case of the technology solution being addressed. This work package has to demonstrate the business case of the technology and identify potential issues of public acceptance, market and regulatory barriers, including standardisation needs. It should also address, where appropriate, synergies between new and existing technologies, regional approaches and other socio-economic and environmental aspects from a life-cycle perspective. 
The current Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL, see Annex to this work programme) and the activities needed to keep the MRL aligned with the advances in the TRL that will be undertaken in the proposal should also be indicated to ensure the potential for exploitation.
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Testing advanced biofuel technologies at large industrial scale reduces the technological risks, paving the way for subsequent first-of-a-kind, commercial-scale industrial demonstration projects. For this purpose, the scale of the proposals should permit obtaining the data and experience required so that a first-of-a-kind, commercial-scale industrial demonstration project can be envisaged as a next step. The industrial concepts demonstrated should have the potential for a significant social and economic impact, notably in terms of job creation, economic growth and safe and affordable energy supply in Europe and beyond.

Specific challenge:Without a technological shift in our current energy system, the EU will fail on its 2050 ambitions to largely decarbonise the energy and transport sectors. The EU needs to accelerate innovation in cutting edge low carbon technologies and innovative solutions, and bridge the gap between research and the market.  A European approach is essential to realise the ambition of seeing low carbon technologies effectively developed in view of bringing them to the market: it allows key players to come together on a continental scale; it helps to identify and to tackle the barriers holding back innovative products and services in the single market; and it allows different sources of private and public funding to be brought together. Today, EU funding remains a limited part of the overall funding across Europe. Implementation needs to be increasingly based on partnerships that build the necessary scale and scope, and achieve greater impact from scarce public and private resources.
Scope: The proposals should aim at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States, Associated States and Regions in the areas and challenges targeted in this 'Competitive low-carbon energy' call or in the ‘Smart Cities and Communities’ call and to implement a joint transnational call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding to fund multinational innovative research initiatives in this domain. Proposers are encouraged to implement other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
Activities should focus on demonstrating and validating solutions that reached already TRL 5-6 and bringing them to TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes). Lower TRL research activities necessary to support this work and forming an integral part of these proposals, will be in scope for funding, provided the bulk of the activities in the proposal remains focused on demonstrating and validating solutions. Appropriate user and general public acceptance, regulatory, market up-take (e.g. e.g. regulatory issues, capacity building and access to finance), social, environmental and resource efficiency aspects should be included. Opening up demonstration facilities for practice-oriented education and training is encouraged. As regards a possible ERA-NET in the area of ‘Smart Cities and Communities’, cooperation with emerging countries (e.g. China) is encouraged, without prejudice of their participation as partners in other initiatives, such as in call for Smart Cities and Communities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of 10 to 20 million Euro would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Acceleration of the time to market of, affordable, cost-effective and resource-efficient technology solutions to decarbonise the energy system in a sustainable way, secure energy supply and complete the energy internal market. Reduction of the environmental footprint and the energy payback time. Strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.

Geothermal resources at medium-high temperature can produce at competitive costs electricity, heat or a combination of both. Routinely created enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) offer the opportunity to produce geothermal energy throughout Europe, including in locations where natural reservoirs are not available. In order to increase the number of geothermal installations, enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) have to be demonstrated as cost-competitive whereby innovative solutions are needed to allow for applications in geologic systems with different characteristics and of different origin.
Scope:
Proposals should aim at testing EGS systems to ensure reservoir productivity in different geological settings and energy production at competitive costs. Proposals could propose up-scaling existing EGS systems.
TRL 7 shall be achieved at the end of project activities (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Opening the project's test sites, pilot and demonstration facilities, or research infrastructures for practice oriented education, training or knowledge exchange is encouraged.

Expected Impact:
The actions will provide the data and the experience required to lower the costs for geothermal electricity and heat production in different geological conditions applying the EGS technology. The action will contribute to increase the penetration of geothermal energy by demonstrating the viability of EGS."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Mexico and Europe have high potential for geothermal energy generation; in particular the Mexican geothermal resource settings provide a unique opportunity to apply and further develop methodologies and technologies in the field of EGS (Enhanced Geothermal Systems) and of superhot systems. Cooperation activities are proposed in the framework of the Bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology between the European Union and the United States of Mexico.
The challenge is to increase knowledge and expertise to reduce technological and social risks associated with the development and exploitation of EGS and superhot geothermal fluids. For EGS, issues such as long-term productivity and unwanted side effects, such as induced seismicity, need to be controlled. In superhot systems the geothermal community needs more experience to address the specific challenges arising from the very hot fluids. These challenges include reliable characterization of the geothermal potential and the interaction of these very hot fluids with subsurface and surface installations. Scientific challenges to be addressed include: prediction of chemical and geological properties and their effect on geothermal operations; advanced fracture characterization technologies to determine the ideal exploitation scheme; identification of ideal areas for locating deep wells; high temperature well-logging tools and sensors; smart (high temperature) tracers.
Scope:
The development of unconventional geothermal systems such as EGS and superhot geothermal resources (including those above the critical point of water) needs further validation and demonstration in specific high-temperature geological environments. Mexico is chosen for testing and developing these technologies further in a relevant geological environment. The focus should be on establishing an inventory of the expanded resource base and on the development of test sites in specific locations.
Proposals shall aim at moving from TRL 3-4 to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Beyond the appropriate regional approach in Mexico, generalised environmental aspects and public acceptance concerns need to be addressed in every phase of the project. Transfer of the knowledge gained to different areas should be pursued. Exploration studies will be performed to provide a comprehensive knowledge of the sites and applied to meet the specific challenges highlighted above.
Proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to progress in the technology development applying and consolidating concepts and technologies in different geological contexts therefore reducing technological and social risks of geothermal developments. The project will promote innovation and technological development in Mexico, establishing a reliable scientific framework to increase the number of commercial geothermal activities. In the project context a strengthening of the European geothermal technology base is also expected, expanding European market for geothermal technologies and creating growth and jobs. Scientific exchange of researches and capacity building are envisaged as an indirect project impact.
Proposals should appropriately exploit the complementarities between the EU and Mexico, and pave the way for significant enhancement in the cooperation between researchers and research institutions.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The wider deployment of CCS requires a significant reduction of the energy intensity of the capture process for power plants or other energy-intensive industries, and a substantial decrease of the cost of capture. Basic research and proof of concept is needed for novel and efficient capture technologies for application in power production and industrial process.
Scope:
The objective is to support the development of high-potential novel technologies or processes for post- and/or pre-combustion CO2 capture. Research should follow new paths leading to highly innovative technologies and materials for CO2 capture applications with the potential for real breakthroughs. This could include systems based on solids or liquids or a combination of these such as Dry Sorption Process, Membrane, and Wet sorption process. Environmentally benign technologies should be pursued and their environmental impact addressed in the project also in view of future scaling up. Projects shall include prototype testing under industrially relevant conditions. Any research that constitutes a technology demonstration at large scale or a combination of CCS technologies proven at pre-demonstration pilot scale will not be considered for funding.
With a view to promoting international cooperation with South Korea, initiatives for collaboration between the EU project(s) to be selected under this topic and the endorsed South Korean project(s) will be required on the basis of mutual benefit and reciprocity. Specific budget needs to be allocated in the EU project for pursuing such twinning activities (e.g. exchange of information, exchange of researchers). The Commission reserves the right to ask the coordinators of Horizon 2020 projects, during the grant preparation, to include further collaboration activities endorsed by the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP).
Focus should be on progressing technologies that already reached TRL 2-3 to TRL 4-5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
A related activity is supported under topic NMBP 22-2017: ""High-performance materials for optimizing CO2 capture"", included in the work programme part 'Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies – 5.ii Nanotechnologies, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing', in which the focus is capitalising on promising material solutions for the next generation CO2 capture technologies.
Proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Significant reduction of the energy penalty of the whole capture process for power plants or other energy-intensive industries, and thus a considerable decrease of the fuel-dependent cost of capture; substantial reduction of the capital cost and of the operational and maintenance (O&M) costs (fixed and non-fuel variable costs) compared to existing technologies.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Capture of CO2 from power plants or industrial processes and subsequent utilisation through (bio-) chemical transformation into high-volume added value products (CCU) can be an alternative to geological storage which could provide an important cost reduction to the entire CO2 sequestration process. CO2 utilisation has the potential to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions if the CO2 replaces manufactured CO2 or the resulting product provides long term abatement of the CO2, or if CO2 replaces fossil fuels as raw materials, depending on the amount of extra energy used in the process. In addition, the conversion of CO2 into fuels could provide opportunities for energy storage and for higher security of fuel supply.
There are still relevant and significant scientific and technological challenges to be able to exploit the CO2 as a chemical and fuel feedstock in a systematic manner. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of such CO2 utilisation technologies to produce added value products at larger scale, in an operational environment to be able to assess the industrial, economic and environmental potential of such technologies.
Scope:
In the context of energy research, the focus will be on CO2 utilisation options that have the potential to yield a significant, net reduction of CO2 emissions in volumes sufficient to make a meaningful contribution to our climate change objectives. The use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery is out of scope of this topic. Projects should address the specific technology needs for capture and purification of CO2 emitted by the power or process industry to deliver the desired concentration and purity for the subsequent conversion process. Technology developments must be accompanied by a Life-Cycle-Assessment (LCA) study, identification of appropriate business model and measures to support market up-take.
Proposals should address innovative processes to produce high-volume added value products from CO2 and demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility in an industrially relevant environment through demonstration of a system prototype. The proposed technologies should also consider the energy balance and the type of energy required for CO2 transformations, the CO2 abatement potential (in terms of time-scale and volume) and process sensitivity to flexible (intermittent) operation. The implementation of this proposal is intended to start at TRL 5-6 and target TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes). An indication and justification of the current TRL as well as a plan to reach the targeted TRL should be part of the proposal.
This topic is contributing to the PPP “SPIRE” (Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency).
Related activities are supported under the topic SPIRE 08-2017: 'CO2 Utilisation to produce added value chemicals' and NMBP 21-2017: 'Cost-effective materials for “power-to-chemical” technologies for materials aspects', both included in the work programme part 'Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies – 5.ii Nanotechnologies, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing'.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstration, in the relevant environment and scale, of the technical and economic feasibility of novel and environmentally friendly processes for CO2 conversion to high-volume added-value products such as chemicals and/or fuels. Reduction of the emissions of greenhouse gases on full LCA basis. Significant decrease of the cost of CCU vs. CCS. Improved energy and resource intensity with respect to conventional manufacturing of the same product. These impacts must be quantified and justified.

","08 December 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The increasing use of subsurface resources resulting from growing energy needs and the growing demand for water and raw materials represent key challenges, requiring a more integrated, efficient and sustainable use of these resources, and the minimisation of any negative health and environmental impacts. Synergies should be nurtured, while conflicts of use should be avoided. This creates at the same time significant opportunities in terms of growth and job creation in advanced technology sectors related to the optimal management and use of the resources. This topic addresses three specific challenges that are highly relevant to the sustainable use of the subsurface: Geo-energy, Groundwater and Raw Materials.
Geo-energy:
With regards to Geo-energy, information is needed on:
The potential contribution from the subsurface (i.e. access to primary energy sources, energy storage potential and storage capacity for CO2 captured from fossil fuel power generation and/or industry)
Potential risks and environmental impacts associated with subsurface use for energy applications
Potential competition and interference of different (energy and other) applications within the subsurface and interactions with surface infrastructures and uses.
Information on the European subsurface must be available and accessible to society in order to enable the more efficient and sustainable use, more integrated management and spatial planning of the subsurface and the energy resources, groundwater and raw materials it contains. This requires setting up a Pan-European database of harmonised and scientifically robust digital information of the subsurface and its potential uses in the field of geo-energy. The use and implementation of the database should be clearly defined and based on common agreed principles.
Groundwater:
Groundwater resources and the subsurface in general are increasingly used for a wide range of applications and therefore under pressure. Groundwater resources are threatened by climate change, pollution and water abstraction. There is a clear need to assess the impact of these drivers on the groundwater resources, their inter-linkage with surface water resources and the groundwater dependent terrestrial and associated aquatic ecosystems including coastal waters; as well as the built environment and rural and urban land use.
Modern technologies allow characterisation and visualisation of groundwater bodies; simulation of potential pathways and groundwater flow velocities; assessment of temporal and spatial trends in groundwater quality and quantity; and assessment of their impact on and interaction with surface waters. Such work both provides and requires information and knowledge of physical, chemical and hydraulic parameters on the European subsurface. These data must be available and easily accessible for all relevant end users to enable proper water resource management and integrated surface and subsurface spatial planning and assessments.
Raw Materials:
The EU Raw Materials policy aims to ensure the sustainable supply of non-energy raw materials from the EU and global sources, including metallic and industrial minerals, as well as construction materials (dimension stones and aggregates).
Supply from the EU sources requires harmonized and standardized EU level data and information on raw material deposits, as well as on mine-wastes materials - such as by-products, waste rocks, tailings and residues – that could be recycled and re-used. Discovery of new resources needs enhanced information and ore deposit models in exploration and resource assessment to focus increasingly on deeply buried deposits, as well as on mineral deposits on or below the sea-floor.
Such EU level data and information do not exist at the moment. However, there is relevant knowledge of mineral deposits at the Member States level with heterogeneous terminology and reporting standards.
There is also a need for European sustainable sub-surface planning and use that should be based on documentation and spatial databases of deposit and high-potential exploration areas.
Scope:
Proposals should pool the necessary resources from national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint transnational call for proposals with EU co-funding. The action is targeted at publically funded research performing organisations. Their participation must be mandated by the national/regional authorities in charge (normally the responsible Ministry). The co-funded call for proposals must be based on in-kind contributions from their institutional funding and the beneficiaries will carry out the transnational projects resulting from their call for proposals fully or partially themselves.
GIS-based databases shall be developed with a view to, in the longer term, the operation and maintenance of an integrated database and map of the European underground, its resources (geo-energy, groundwater and raw materials) and its potential uses. Where appropriate, synergies and compatibility with the EPOS research infrastructure is required and will ensure that developed databases, tools and models can serve the largest communities. The database shall be INSPIRE compliant and be compatible with energy minerals data and marine maps (EMODnet) for the proper land planning and use of both surface and sub-surface. Furthermore, databases should have the technical specifications so that they can be potentially hosted by the European Commission.
Geo-energy:
In the field of geo-energy, the ERA-NET shall collate, interpret and produce reliable and impartial scientific information on geologically based energy resources and potential environmental and climate consequences related to their potential exploitation (e.g. hazards, risks, interference, synergies, conflicts of use), including conventional and unconventional[1] oil and gas, coal, coal bed methane (CBM), gas hydrates, geothermal resources and uranium, as well as CO2 storage and energy storage (note that certain resources are of local relevance only such as for example gas hydrates and uranium). This includes developing state-of-the-art methodologies and workflows focusing on efficient cross border and integrated pan-European resource mapping and assessment, both onshore and offshore. Specific site investigations are excluded from the ERA-NET scope.
Deliverables should among others comprise online atlases of geo-energy related resources; their properties essential for assessing feasibility, performance and behaviour; maps and cross-sections of main structural elements and faults.
Groundwater:
In the field of groundwater, research should develop and enhance the knowledge and the predictive capacity needed to assess the impact of climate change and human activities on groundwater resources and dependent surface waters and ecosystems, and the consequences for groundwater quantitative and chemical status assessed according to the Water Framework and Groundwater directives. High quality models including estimated simulation and projection uncertainties are required tools for decision support systems that allow e.g.:
Elaboration of cost-effective measures and assessment of their (cost) effectiveness;
Sustainable decision making taking into account the water-food-energy nexus;
The ERA-NET will contribute to:
State-of-the-art resource mapping and assessment that will set the basis for an integrated Europe-wide monitoring system of groundwater in line with the Water Framework Directive;
Integrated groundwater and surface water assessments, simulations and projections both at local/regional and transnational (large river basins) scale.
Deliverables shall include:
Improved tools and models for subsurface characterisation, risk assessment and assessment of the impact of climate change, human activities and other uses of the subsurface on groundwater resources and dependent terrestrial ecosystems;
3D maps of groundwater resources;
Temporal and spatial groundwater pollution trends including diffuse pollution of especially nutrients (N, P) and pesticides from agriculture, trends in nutrient loadings to ecosystems, and fate, behaviour and degradation of emerging pollutants from industry, households and agriculture, and the resulting impact on dependent terrestrial ecosystems;
Groundwater and surface water flooding risks;
Saltwater / seawater intrusion and the resulting impact on dependent terrestrial ecosystems;
Groundwater abstraction needs for water supply and irrigation and the resulting impact on dependent terrestrial ecosystems (including soils), surface waters, and groundwater associated aquatic ecosystems, the groundwater ecosystem itself, and the built environment (e.g. damage of infrastructure due to land subsidence
Raw Materials:
The Raw Materials specific challenge shall address non-energy non-agricultural raw materials and minerals, and shall address all 28 EU Member States[2].
The ERA-NET shall, through intelligence networking and coordination, enhance and maintain the pan-EU mineral deposits inventory/database, in line with and building on existing activities in the framework of the EIP on Raw Materials. It shall provide economic geology maps of construction materials and industrial and metallic minerals across the EU 28 Member States in a free publicly accessible Internet/web-portal form. The ERA-NET shall also deliver a pilot study identifying targets for general exploration, using innovative technologies and challenging a better understanding of ore genesis and direct exploration at deeper, unexploited levels of the Earth’s crust.
Deliverables shall include:
Pan-EU mineral deposits inventory
The deposits inventory will be developed with a view, in the longer term, to create an integrated geographical database and a mineral resources map of the European sub-surface and its potential development and uses.
The inventory should build upon national and regional level databases and past and on-going EU funded projects providing better insight into the distribution of known mineral raw material resources.
The use of standardized and harmonized pan-European datasets of primary and secondary resources (land and marine) will contribute to enhancing investment conditions for the mining industry.
Digital Annual Minerals Yearbooks covering the territory of at least all 28 EU Member States.
Pilot Study:
The Pilot study should identify targets for general exploration and further governmental spending, which is necessary to attract private investment into detailed exploration and mining across the whole EU. This can be achieved by developing and applying innovative exploration technologies (3D/4D) to locate deep-seated deposits. The pilot study should deliver high-quality metallogenetic, mineral potential and predictivity maps - which may lead to discovery of new or little-known types of ore deposits and ore-forming systems, including of critical raw materials, in specifically targeted areas.
Results of the pilot study will feed into the EU mineral deposits inventory, and will set the stage for follow-up activities.
Expected Impact:
Improved interoperability of data and information, thus allowing a uniform, unbiased and independent insight in the distribution of identified and prospective geo-energy, groundwater and raw materials resources. Better understanding and management of the water-energy-raw materials nexus through a more integrated and efficient management and exploitation (and more responsible and publicly-accepted use) of subsurface resources for the various uses, while reducing any associated potential impacts and risks.

","Research and Innovation action
","20 September 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Geo-energy applications such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), the development of unconventional hydrocarbons (in particular shale gas) and to some extent also geothermal operations, can have an impact on the subsurface. Consequently, advanced and cost effective monitoring is vital for the sustainable management of the subsurface and its resources.
In CCS, continuous and sophisticated monitoring, imaging and control of the growth of the CO2 plume is a prerequisite for the safe and sustainable storage of significant volumes of CO2 in the subsurface. In addition, CO2 injection in CCS but also water (re-)injection in geothermal operations may lead to induced seismicity.
Recently, the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources - in particular shale gas - has resulted in new opportunities, but also bears environmental and public health risks, which need to be better understood, monitored, managed and communicated appropriately. These risks relate mainly to water pollution (in particular stemming from insufficient underground characterisation, inappropriate well casing, the use of chemicals in the fracking process, and waste management), but also air emissions, induced seismicity and local impacts linked to transport, land and water use.
Research is needed to better understand and quantify possible (natural and engineered) leakage pathways for CO2 and natural gas, the rates of leakage into aquifers and escape at surface, the impacts that leakage can have on fresh groundwater resources, soil and biodiversity, and the time frame in which emissions will return to baseline values. The effective detection and quantification of leakage requires a scientifically robust method for determining natural background concentrations of CO2 and natural gas in the soil and at the surface. Uniform, unbiased and independent data are needed to manage and mitigate the risks of subsurface geo-energy related operations.
Scope:
An integrated R&D project to gain a better understanding of the possible risks related to CCS and the exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons. Focus should be on the detection and monitoring of induced seismicity and stray gases (CO2 and natural gas), and on the mitigation and remediation of their possible negative impacts. A comprehensive R&D programme should combine laboratory experiments, modelling and short- and longer-term field investigations that could include observation wells for the deployment of monitoring equipment. The drilling of exploration and production wells, hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation and intentional subsurface release of fluids or gases to the groundwater or the atmosphere are strictly outside the scope of this topic.
Issues to be addressed include:
Characterisation and lab testing of well seals, analysis of possible leakage pathways and rates, their time-related evolution as well as the mitigation of leakage;
Geochemical and microbial interactions with host rocks, overburden, engineered seals such as cement and casing, groundwater, soil and biodiversity;
Significantly improved detection limits for CO2, natural gas and natural or human-introduced substances (e.g. metals, chemicals, organic compounds) that may be released through subsurface operations;
Determination and validation of the optimal spatial and temporal resolution of a wide range of monitoring techniques, including for microseismicity;
Sophisticated, scientifically robust method for determining natural background concentrations of CO2 and natural gas in the soil and at the surface, and for distinguishing between biogenic and thermogenic methane emissions;
Development of groundwater remediation methods and protocols;
The project should establish the following:
One or more field sites for the deployment of a comprehensive suite of detection and monitoring methods (geophysical, seismic, chemical, biological, surface and subsurface, …);
A programme for international cooperation to improve and cross-validate highly sophisticated detection and monitoring technologies for subsurface diffusion of CO2 and natural gas and other substances that may be released through subsurface operations. Focus should be on cooperation and networking with comparable projects in the US and Canada, including the exchange of researchers;
A well-documented contribution to the establishment of best practices for baselining, monitoring, mitigation and remediation methods and technologies;
A continuous training programme for researchers and students.
The project should take into account the on-going development by the Commission of a Best Available Techniques (BAT) Guidance document on upstream hydrocarbon exploration and production[1], as well as the results of relevant EU supported studies and projects[2].
RRI (RRI) and Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) have to be taken on board in all areas of H2020. In the context of this topic, this includes multi-actor and public engagement in research and innovation, enabling easier access to scientific results, the take up of ethics in the research and innovation content and process, and formal and informal science education.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Industry participation is strongly encouraged to facilitate access to existing sites and data, and to allow extending the operating period of the research infrastructure beyond the project duration. In order to allow a timely use of the results, the duration of the project itself should ideally be limited to 3 years.
The project should take account of the review of the effectiveness of the Commission Recommendation of 22 January 2014 on minimum principles for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons (2014/70/EU) (such as shale gas) using high-volume hydraulic fracturing. For the purpose of any testing and demonstration activities, proposals should clearly describe how the project will comply with all relevant environmental legislation, in particular the Water Framework Directive[3], the enforcement of which is the responsibility of permitting authorities in the concerned Member States.
Expected Impact:
Projects should deliver the unbiased and independent scientific evidence to assist policy making for CCS and unconventional hydrocarbons development. This topic is expected to provide European and (in particular) North American researchers, industry and policymakers with a platform to enhance and deepen transatlantic dialogue on environmental issues related to CCS and unconventional hydrocarbons development, to accelerate learning and to provide advanced training. Connecting pilots and projects across the Atlantic should bring the benefits of cross-validation of technologies, sharing results, distributing tasks, bundling expertise and expanding professional networks. For optimal impact, the research and training infrastructure should ideally remain available and operational beyond the duration of the EU support.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The application of CCS to industrial sectors other than power (e.g. steel, cement, refining) is expected to deliver half of the global emissions reduction from CCS by 2050. In the near future, these industrial applications will open up new opportunities and avenues for CCS that can accelerate its deployment. Also, Bio-CCS technologies have the potential of leading to CO2 negative emissions. Integrating CCS technology in the best possible way so as to optimise the use of energy in the capture process, minimise process efficiency losses, achieve a suitable CO2 purity for transport and storage, and maintain the quality of the industrial end product, is a particular challenge.
Scope:
Piloting under realistic conditions is required to significantly lower the energy penalty and capture costs. Projects must include activities to explore (possibly shared) local or regional transport and storage needs and solutions.
Focus should be on progressing technologies that already reached TRL 4-5 to TRL 7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Environmentally benign and cost-effective technologies should be pursued.
Collaboration with industrial end users is essential.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with China.
Knowledge sharing with a wide range of stakeholders, as well as early and sustained engagement and involvement of concerned communities through targeted information and dissemination activities, is essential.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4 to 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The cost- and resource-effective application of CCS in industrial operations will expand the available options for CCS and provide a stepping stone to its wider deployment; the concomitant deployment of CCS both in fossil-fuel power production and in energy-intensive industries could facilitate clusters of CCS projects, thereby improving economies of scale for both CO2 transport and storage. CCS in energy intensive industry can help ensure a competitive position for existing EU industries in a future carbon-restrained world, thus reconciling competitiveness with EU climate goals.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, architectural and planning rules for protected historic buildings lead to major technical constrains in integrating renewable energy such as photovoltaic. These problems call for innovative and creative solutions for building integrated photovoltaic that must combine aesthetic and photovoltaic technology applied in historical buildings that represent the artistic and cultural heritage of a city.
Scope:
This inducement prize will reward a European protected historic urban district that has perfectly integrated in its buildings a photovoltaic system to generate and supply electricity for its own consumption. In this context the photovoltaic system includes all the necessary components to supply power within a district.
The prize will induce the integration of new photovoltaic systems in protected historic urban districts. It will also foster the development of the best suitable architectural and aesthetic design in combination with optimal technical solutions delivering the least visible impact and a minimal intrusion to the structure of the buildings. The prize aims as well to mobilise and enhance private and public investment for replication of similar solutions in Europe.
The specific rules of the contest will be published in 2016 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.
Indicative prize amount: EUR 0.75 million.
Expected Impact:
The prize winner will be the entrant (a community) that has installed and operated in the protected historic urban district in Europe a new building integrated photovoltaic system (BIPV) to provide electricity corresponding to at least 50% of the required electricity consumption of the district. The suggested energy solution shall be adaptable and replicable to other districts. Clear energy security and economic benefits shall be attained to assure replications.
It is expected that the prize will accelerate the innovation in photovoltaic technologies and architectural enhancement needed for sustainable use of European protected historic urban districts. Integrating photovoltaics in this type of districts will create new industrial expertise. It will also give a good opportunity to local small and medium-sized enterprises to develop new ideas and demonstrate their know-how.

","07 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
The future energy system will be more distributed, heavily relying on renewable energy sources and a new market design. While common technological and market solutions to link energy systems across Europe are the subject of topics LCE 1-5 of this Work Programme, the implementation of new technological options and business processes is needed to optimise systems on a local (e.g. municipalities) and regional level (in the sense of regions within a country) and to link them to a secure and resilient European energy system.
Local and regional utilities, SMEs and start-up companies could play a major role to provide the technological, economic, legal and organisational knowledge and build co-creation ecosystems with private and communal initiatives to develop and implement respective solutions. The acceptance of these new energy solutions could allow for consumers and citizens to participate in sharing models and smart business processes and be actors in the local energy system.
Scope:
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area.
Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
The scope of activities should range from “technical energy grids” to “business and citizen networks for energy” relying on tools that have been developed in practical exercises throughout Europe in regions, municipalities, small utilities and innovative SMEs. This implies to bridge various energy domains (e. g. power, heat) to make best use of local and regional potentials.
The proposed actions should close the gap between technical availability and deployment. A key challenge for the proposed actions will be to integrate the market uptake mechanism that have been studied for every single energy carrier and generation technology and deploy them exploiting regional characteristics, networking structures and drivers. Proposals should build include the set-up of a knowledge platforms (such as developed for example by ERA-Net Smart Grid Plus) and promote transnational mutual learning. Proposals should deal with innovative technologies such as IT platforms, storage that links multiple energy carriers, etc. and latest trends such as sharing economy, to develop innovative services, governance models and business structures that allow for involving consumers and citizens as true market partners.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution in the range of EUR 7.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Acceleration of the development of appropriate and sound technical and business process solutions for energy systems on a local and regional level, by utilizing national and regional Research and Innovation / Development funds to initiate and support cooperation between pioneer regions across Europe (including their utilities), technology providers and experts,
Demonstration and validation of successful approaches of regional development (including respective additional funding mechanisms) linked with common and new business models in the energy domain to accelerate deployment of latest resource-efficient and decarbonising technology,
New business scenarios that promote public private partnerships and allow small companies and crafts to benefit from technological progress in the energy domain thereby creating growth and jobs in all European regions,
Proven guidance and tools for regional policy makers and municipal utilities that aim for a new energy model while not jeopardizing secure and cost effective supply.
Engagement of local/regional stakeholders and companies in the energy system and emergence of new business opportunities

","Inducement Prize
","05 July 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Preventing dangerous climate change is a key priority for the European Union. Europe is working hard to cut its greenhouse gas emissions substantially while encouraging other nations and regions to do likewise. One way to help these efforts is to make use of the CO2 by integrating it in consumer products. CO2 re-use technologies however are still facing a number of technical, commercial and/or financial barriers.
Scope:
This inducement prize will therefore reward innovative products utilising CO2 that could significantly reduce the atmospheric emissions of CO2 when deployed at commercial scale.
The prize will induce actors in the field of CO2 utilisation to do more to enhance their processes and products so that they reduce atmospheric emissions of CO2. It aims also to mobilise and enhance private R&I investment, attract non-traditional players, create new partnerships and incentivise researchers and innovators to enhance efforts to abate emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to atmosphere.
The specific rules of the contest will be published in 2016 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.
Indicative prize amount: EUR 1.5 million.
Expected Impact:
The prize winner will be the entrant that has developed a product demonstrating, over the duration of the contest, the most significant and measurable improvements in the mass of CO2 utilised in it while overcoming technical, commercial and/or financial barriers. Efforts shall be replicable and scalable in order that the processes and products can be rolled out in the future. Clear commercialisation plans that are key to assuring medium-term benefits of the activities undertaken towards the prize will also have to be presented.
It is expected that the prize will accelerate innovation in CO2 utilisation technologies, also in SMEs; facilitate discovering the real potential of CO2 utilisation to contribute to climate mitigation; increase transparency about technology readiness, barriers, costs, environmental performance and innovation needs; increase leverage of private finance for innovation; provide with new business models and value chains in the CO2 utilisation sector.

","28 August 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: The European air transport system plays an essential role in creating links between people and exchanges for business, leisure and culture within Europe and worldwide. In 2010, it was capable of transporting over 750 million passengers within the EU airspace relying on 450 airports. It carried also around 22% of EU trade with the rest of the world by value. Today, the typical duration of intra-European flights is short, but the overall time spent in travelling from door to door could be significantly shortened and the accessibility could be improved. In the case of disruption, the response of the air transport system is not yet satisfactory. The challenge is to enhance the time efficiency, seamlessness, robustness and accessibility of the European air transport system.
Scope: The proposed research and innovation actions could target products and services which can enhance customer experience, minimise the duration of the travel of air passengers and provide them with integrated and comprehensive information so as to make informed decisions in selecting, modifying or reconfiguring their travel. They could also target improved accessibility to airports and aircraft, including for passengers with reduced mobility, as well as methods and systems to be put in place in case of major disruption, e.g. volcanic ash clouds, allowing an organised and efficient re-routing of passengers, making the best used of all transport modes.
Research and innovation could target optimised landside operations which can decrease aircraft turnover time, enhance predictability, minimise the time needed for aircraft operations at the airport and maximise freight fluxes.
The SESAR Joint Undertaking addresses research and innovation actions targeting the increase of the capacity of the Air Traffic Management System and airport ATM dependent processes, including for intermodality purposes. Therefore such actions are excluded from this Call.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting smaller or larger amounts.
Expected impact: Actions will demonstrate in a quantified manner their potential to mature the Technology Readiness Level (TRL; please see part G of the General Annexes)  in the range of 1-6, of technologies and concepts that can make a significant contribution towards one or several of the following of the high level goals by 2050:
      90% of the travels involving air transport within Europe can be completed in 4 hours door to door.
      Passengers can make informed decisions.
      Air transport is well connected to other modes.
Actions will also provide ad-hoc indicators to measure the expected progress in terms of, for example, reduction of the travel time, increase in airport capacity, etc., when comparing the situation before the start of the action and after its completion. In the case of novel products and services, the potential markets will be identified together with the potential corresponding volumes / value.

European aeronautics has never been stronger, however new opportunities and challenges lie towards 2020 and beyond. Research and innovation is the main response towards maintaining the competitiveness throughout the whole supply chain. While a number of technologies are already addressed under the Clean Sky 2 Public-Private Partnership, there are other promising ones at low maturity levels that need to be further advanced. Primes, suppliers including SMEs, research laboratories and academia should collaborate in an efficient and timely manner to bring these innovative technologies to higher maturity levels for these advanced and cost-efficient products and services.
Scope:
Proposed actions should address one or several of the following priority areas:
―Condition-based health management, replacing scheduled inspections and thus decreasing maintenance costs and increasing safety and aircraft availability through accelerating the integration of innovative and existing sensor technologies, advancing data analysis methods and promoting standards for health sensing across dissimilar systems and structures, developing and validating multiple sensor technologies on systems and structures, and addressing relevant regulatory barriers.
―Advancements in composite aero-structures that have the potential to offer alternative competitive technologies and methodologies and are presently at low Technology Readiness Levels (e.g. new generation materials and composite structures, validation of new simulation and design methodologies, advanced manufacturing methods, including out-of-autoclave, joining between composites similar or dissimilar media fatigue and damage tolerance behaviour and the related structural health monitoring and repair methodologies, long term behaviour and degradation of eco-efficient surface protection).
―Internal and external Electromagnetic Environment technologies addressing at large electromagnetic immunity problems stemming from the increasing complexity of on-board systems in a composite aero-structures and smart materials environment. Analysis of regulatory and standardisation issues should be provided and certification/qualification issues addressed.
―Development and validation of multi-disciplinary design tools that address key isolated or clustered industrial problems with low degree of confidence that need presently extensive experimental verification. Activities may contribute to advancing further physical understanding of multi-physics phenomena, simulation of manufacturing processes and design of experiments, uncertainty quantification, cross-cutting computational procedures as well as preparatory work for transition to high-performance computing.
Given the strong involvement of SMEs in the supply chain, this topic is particularly relevant for SME participation.

Expected Impact:
The actions will contribute towards maintaining the leadership of the European aeronautics industry through increased availability of new innovative design tools, materials, manufacturing and service processes:
―For the condition-based health management, the actions will quantitatively demonstrate potential improvements towards weight benefits, systems complexity and reduced maintenance costs and demonstrate that European primes and suppliers have an agreed common roadmap towards potential exploitation of the results.
―For the novel composite aero-structures, the actions will demonstrate their capability to drive costs down and production rates up using new generation composites as well as nonconventional manufacturing methods.
―For the internal and external electromagnetic environment technologies, the actions will demonstrate that an increase up to 60% of the confidence in the electromagnetic assessment process is feasible. The proposals will also demonstrate that the proposed concepts and development of tools will contribute to substantial reduction of cost (including qualification and certification) and time-to-market.
―For the development and validation of multi-disciplinary design tools, the actions will develop computing solutions for key industrial problems to facilitate the introduction of innovative products and services."

―Development of novel technologies contributing to more electric aircraft, including new power electronic devices, low energy systems, advanced power generators and actuation systems as well as innovative power and power management concepts.
―Advancements in core engine technologies to develop new innovative concepts towards improving thermal efficiency by increasing the Operational Pressure Ratio.
―Development and demonstration of integrated aero-structures with self-sensing, morphing or multi-functional capabilities towards reduced weight and better aerodynamic performance as well as decreased manufacturing and operational cost.

Specific challenge: In order to leverage resources, mitigate risks and establish long term relationships, the European aeronautics sector should identify topics of common interest and mutual benefit with other regions of the world, in particular where these address societal challenges such as a worldwide safe and environmental-friendly air transport system, common standards (including for environmental aspects) and win-win situations for technological development. Aeronautics has inherently and increasingly an international dimension because almost all current aircraft programmes involve stakeholders from many different countries. Several areas of mutual interest with China have been identified through previous actions, such as the FP7 support actions GRAIN (EU-China) and IFARs (multinational aviation research forum).
Scope: For the coming years, coordinated research and innovation actions with China, involving the appropriate funding from both sides, should address one of the following specific areas of common interest between Europe and China:
–      Innovative methods and numerical technologies for airframe and engine noise reduction. For achieving noise reduction goals of Europe’s ‘Flightpath 2050’, advanced technologies are needed to further reduce the noise of the airframe and the engines including installation effects. The aim is to investigate experimentally and numerically innovative control approaches, in order to uncover technologies with a potential of achieving next step reductions in airframe and engine noise. Research should focus on advanced methods for simulation of noise generation mechanisms in complex geometries, and the investigation of passive and active control strategies. This includes multidisciplinary optimisation methodologies, in support of the design of advanced control systems for noise reduction with the lowest impact on performance, weight and cost.
–      Development of bio-sourced composite materials and environment-friendly multifunctional composites and structures for aeronautics applications. Current state-of-the-art composite materials used in aircraft production are mainly carbon-based. The next generation of aviation technologies should demonstrate significant progress towards global ambitious environmental targets. To achieve such targets, multifunctional bio-composite materials offer a significant potential and need to be further developed. Future joint research work should focus primarily on:
o  Design and manufacturing of bio-sourced polymeric resins, reinforcing fibres and honeycomb papers for aeronautics applications.
o  Application of bio-sourced composite materials for aircraft secondary structures and interior components.
o  Process engineering and simulation of bio-sourced multi-functional composite materials including properties such as structure-electric conductivity, structure-fire retardant and structure-damping composites.
–      Flow control and advanced numerical tools for physical modelling of unsteady flows of aircraft and its components. The overall aerodynamic efficiency of future aircraft and their component will provide a significant contribution to the specific CO2 reduction of future aviation. Enhanced methods in numerical prediction and the use of high-performance computing (HPC) will contribute to faster and improved design processes. Research should focus on:
o  The development or enhancement of high fidelity numerical analysis tools for the quantitative investigation of turbulent drag reduction technologies.
o  The optimisation of algorithm efficiency and exploitation of high-performance computing (HPC).
o  Investigation and choice of the most efficient strategies for e.g. active suppression of turbulent skin friction or control of high-speed flow separation.
o  The flow control and turbulent mixing for turbomachinery applications.
–      Enhanced additive manufacturing of metal components and resources efficient manufacturing processes for aerospace applications. The demand for material efficient and sustainable production processes require new advanced technologies for the aerospace industry. Technologies that offer substantial potential are:
o  The current processes of Additive Manufacturing (AM) are promising, but still present building rates that are too low to be commercially viable for large components. The research should focus on modelling and simulation of the AM process of metal components, which can optimise the manufacturing process, decrease the cost and lead time, to improve quality and to accelerate the AM implementation in aerospace industries.
o  Powder hot isostatic pressing (HIPping) using titanium is promising for manufacturing of aircraft structures. Here the influence of the variability in composition of Ti powders needs to be assessed. The capability to manufacture large HIPped Ti structures with required consistency and repeatability has to be further developed for future commercialised processes.
o  The casting and welding of large titanium aerospace structures have been demonstrated, but they need to be enhanced for being compliant with industrial requirements such as dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1.3 to 1.8 million would allow each specific area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of other proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Actions will demonstrate their potential to mature the level of readiness of technologies and concepts, identify how the project results will be of mutual benefit and evaluate the leverage effect resulting from the coordinating research and innovation funding of EU and China.

Specific challenge: Safety is embedded in aircraft design and operations making air transport the safest transport mode. In Europe, accident rates involving passenger fatalities are of the order of 1.6 accidents per million flights (EASA[1], 2011). Nevertheless, existing risks (e.g. cabin air quality) and new risks (e.g. arising from the integration of new technologies, new operations or emerging potential hazards) must be actively monitored and mitigated; continuous efforts are necessary to maintain the excellent records Europe has achieved over the last 60 years. Furthermore, the aviation community pursues a further decrease of accident rates by one order of magnitude and further significant progress will be achieved only if safety is addressed at system level. Therefore actions are needed using an integrated approach to safety.
Scope: Proposals will encompass research and innovation actions in targeted areas of aviation safety. The proposed research and innovation actions should be part of a broader safety roadmap established at system level, identifying and prioritising practical actions to be undertaken in the next seven years. It should be consistent with other roadmaps (e.g. European Aviation Research Partnership Group thematic programme, Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) of the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE). Coordination with key European organisations which have a mandate in aviation safety (e.g. EASA, EUROCONTROL) and key European Initiatives (e.g. ACARE Working Group 4 on ‘Safety and Security’, OPTICS Coordination Action on safety research) should be ensured.
Proposals should also demonstrate that the research and innovation actions for which EU-funding is requested will be complemented by other research and innovation actions on safety carried out by the proposal partners with at least an equivalent magnitude in terms of estimated resources (e.g. cumulated effort in person-months) in a time frame which matches that of the project. A methodology should be put forward to evaluate this leverage effect during the project and at its end. The proposal should describe how links will be established with the other research and innovation actions from the partners and how the project will contribute to coordinate these.
The composition of the consortium should reflect openness and the fact that the partners have been selected in the light of the nature of the proposed actions. The overall management of the initiative could be designed for a longer term than the duration of the project with a potential to be extended to other activities after a first review of the concept. Where relevant, actions could include networking with projects from leading entities from third countries, to leverage resources and global impact (e.g. with US and Canada).
Proposals should demonstrate in a quantified manner their potential to mature the Technology Readiness Level (TRL; please see part G of the General Annexes) of technologies and concepts in the range 1-6. Proposals should also provide ad-hoc indicators to measure the expected progress in terms of reduction of the number of accidents when comparing the situation before the start of the project and after the implementation of results. Also an indicator assessing the magnitude of the leverage effect resulting from the coordination of the research based on both the EU-funded part and the part of the work relying on partners in-house resources should be provided.
Expected impact: Actions will contribute to reach by 2050 less than one accident per 10 million commercial aircraft flight departures and an 80% reduction of the accident rate compared to 2000 for specific operations, where weather hazards are evaluated and mitigated, in a system which includes all types of air vehicles, manned and unmanned, while preserving cost and time efficiency. It is also expected that the proposal will gather critical mass on a pan-European scale, overcoming gaps, duplication and fragmentation, create a leverage effect, enhance coherence and efficiency of aviation safety research in Europe and underpin the development of future safety regulations, operations and technology.

Specific challenge: Aviation has an important impact on the environment and EU citizens due to emissions such as greenhouse gas (CO2), pollutants (NOx), particulate matter (e.g. black carbon), contrails, cirrus cloud and noise, some of them potentially affecting the health of the exposed population. Aircraft manufacturing also makes use of a variety of materials and chemicals. If no actions would be undertaken, the impact of aviation on our environment in Europe would significantly grow due to the expected increase of air transport traffic by 5% every year. While Clean Sky and its potential successor programme address the reduction of the environmental impact of aircraft with a targeted entry into service in 2025, there is a need to work on significant improvements for aircraft that will enter into service after 2025.
Scope: The proposed research and innovation actions could target the reduction of emissions and noise at the source, i.e. accelerating the development of green technologies for the aircraft and its engines, including the impact of the use of alternative and more sustainable energy sources than those currently used.
Research and innovation could also target new approaches to an environmentally friendly overall aircraft lifecycle which require the insertion of the environmental concern in all the successive phases: design, production, assembly, maintenance, overhaul, repair, retrofit, recycling and disposal.
Finally, research and innovation could target greener ground operations, technologies and procedures, including the integration of larger quantities of sustainable fuels and better use of power from the terminal.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 8 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting smaller or larger amounts.
Expected impact: Actions will demonstrate in a quantified manner their potential to mature the Technology Readiness Level (TRL; please see part G of the General Annexes), in the range of 1-6, of technologies and concepts that can make a significant contribution towards one or several of the following high level goals:
      To reduce CO2 by 75%, NOx and particles by 90% (per passenger and per kilometre), perceived noise by 65% in 2050 (baseline year 2000), to reduce the emission of local atmospheric pollutants.
      To contribute to reduce the impact of Europe's air transport operations on the environment.
      To produce by 2050 competitive air vehicles that are designed and manufactured in a resource efficient way and are recyclable.
Actions will also provide ad-hoc indicators to measure the expected progress in terms of, for example, reduction of CO2, NOx, noise, sustainability criteria, etc. when comparing the situation before the start of the action and after the implementation of its results.

Specific challenge: In order to leverage resources, mitigate risks and establish long term relationships, the European aeronautics sector should identify topics of common interest and mutual benefit with other regions of the world, in particular where these address societal challenges such as a worldwide safe and environmental-friendly air transport system, common standards (including for environmental aspects) and win-win situations for technological development. Aeronautics has inherently and increasingly an international dimension because almost all current aircraft programmes involve stakeholders from many different countries. Several areas of mutual interest with Canada have been identified through previous actions, such as the FP7 support actions CANNAPE (EU-Canada) and IFARs (multinational aviation research forum).
Scope: For the coming years, coordinated research and innovation actions with Canada, involving the appropriate funding from both sides, should address one of the following specific areas of common interest between Europe and Canada:
–      Reducing environmental impact through advanced design of novel aircraft configurations. In order to decrease fuel consumption and the environmental footprint of aviation, the efficiency of future aircraft should be increased. Different aircraft configurations can be explored in comparison to the standard tube-and-wing concept. Research work should aim at new and enhanced methods in design to enable advanced and novel aircraft configurations with reduced overall emissions. Among others, novel multidisciplinary optimisation tools can be complemented with analytical and numerical research. Experiments on specific advanced technologies can be also included.
–      Reducing noise through novel materials design and application on engines and/or airframes. For achieving noise reduction goals, a better understanding of the complex phenomena associated to the absorption of acoustic energy is needed together with advanced technologies to further reduce the noise from the airframe and the engines. Research work should aim at new designs and new application of materials with a potential of achieving next step reductions in airframe and/or engine noise, with the lowest negative impact on performance, weight and cost. Research can include proof-of-concept experiments to validate the understanding of noise reduction mechanisms.
–      Resource-efficient high-performance advanced-materials product development and manufacturing. The increasing use of advanced materials in aircraft together with the demand for sustainable production requires new advanced technologies for the aeronautical industry. Research work should aim at more efficient product development and manufacturing in terms of use of resources, time and costs. Among others, research could include aspects related to green materials and processes and manufacturing automation.
–      Reducing energy consumption through more electrical aircraft and systems integration. Electrically-driven systems are increasingly used in aviation, aiming at increasing propulsion efficiency and reducing environmental impact and costs. Research work should aim at development and optimised integration of electrical systems in future aircraft to minimise overall energy consumption. Among others, research could include aspects related to highly integrated systems, incl. health monitoring.

Aeronautics has inherently and increasingly an international dimension because almost all current aircraft programmes involve stakeholders from many different countries. Several areas of mutual interest with Japan have been identified through previous actions, such as the FP7 support actions SUNJET (EU-Japan) and IFARs (multinational aviation research forum). For the coming years, actions are called in the two following domains with Japan:
1.    To establish or deepen links with countries, building on previously established cooperation where relevant, with the aim to identify subjects of common interest and mutual benefit.
2.    To perform coordinated research and innovation actions on topics of common interest, involving the appropriate funding from both sides.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the two following domains, the first is opened in 2014 and the second domain is opened in 2015:
1.    Set up platform of communication between EU and Japan including research and innovation stakeholders (industry, research establishments, and academia) and aviation research and innovation funding authorities to maintain a common research and innovation roadmap. This could include organisation of workshops and short term studies to identify preferred areas of common interest and win-win situations, barriers and solutions for improved cooperation in research and technology development, and recommendations for future actions. Proposals should demonstrate good knowledge of research mechanisms in the EU and Japan and take into account past and on-going cooperation initiatives.
2.    The proposed research and innovation actions should address one of the following specific areas of common interest between Europe and Japan:
–      Future passenger-friendly cabin architecture and systems. Societal trends in demographics (e.g. aging population) and in behaviour (e.g. use of personal electronic devices) call for aviation to adapt towards a tailored passenger-experience. By taking into account societal demands, cultural specificities and technology strengths from Europe and Japan, research work should aim at innovative human-centred cabin space architectures and advanced on-board systems to enhance accessibility, safety, comfort, connectivity and availability of new contents and services. Aspects such as efficient cabin installation / re-configuration, power and data distribution, communications and electro-magnetic radiation should be addressed accordingly.
–      Lighter integrated heat exchanger systems. In order to decrease CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, future configurations will demand increasing levels of heat management e.g. for oil, fuel and air. Current heat exchanger systems will not be sufficient and new technological advances are required to comply also with other challenges, such as reduced space, weight and cost. Research work should aim at further developing technologies, at better integrating the components and at advancing manufacturing capabilities to enable compact low-cost heat exchanger systems.
–      Efficient composite structure manufacturing and monitoring. The increasing use of composite materials in aircraft calls for more efficient manufacturing processes in terms of resources, time and costs. In addition, the specific behaviour of composites in relation to high-temperature, lightning-strike, impact, etc. calls for better integrating structural health monitoring and protection mechanisms. Research work should aim at increased productivity, reliability and performance through new composite manufacturing and assembly processes for aircraft production.
–      Smarter flight control technologies for enhanced safety. Safety is embedded in aircraft design and operations making air transport the safest transport mode. Nevertheless, pilot assistance in case of exceptionally degraded flight conditions has potential to further enhance safety. Research work should aim at smarter flight control technologies such as fault-tolerant / adaptive control, in-flight self-learning systems and haptic interfaces for pilot assistance, especially at emergency situations.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1.3 to EUR 1.8 million would allow each specific area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of other proposals requesting other amounts.

European yards and marine equipment manufacturers, often consisting of SMEs, are world leaders in the construction of complex vessels, in small and medium-sized, value-added vessels and in highly specialised vessels. In addition to making the production and use of existing vessel concepts more efficient, new waterborne business cases require more specialised and customised vessels. The specific challenge is to explore the best design concepts and construction and production principles for complex, one off and small series vessels, and for modular standardised vessels, also in terms of marketability (technology push) and future skills requirements along the value chain (especially as regards SMEs active in this area).
Scope:
In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
―Develop and validate advanced ferry concepts for European waters (urban, inland waterways and short sea), covering hull designs, equipment and operations, including optimised land-side interfaces.
―Explore and validate low impact cruise and passenger ship designs and operations (noise, discharges, ballast water management), in particular for all seasons operations and challenging environments.
―Develop and validate modular standardised workboat concepts.
―Develop and validate vessel concepts and designs for new waterborne transport and transport support operations, including low-viscous resistance frames and where appropriate novel and more efficient ice-breaking technologies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 12 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The outcome of activities will contribute to the competitiveness of the sector by bringing forward innovative solutions that build on the current and future technological capacities and human resources of European companies: proof of concept up to the level of demonstrators including the assessment of cost-benefits (ferries/passenger vessels), development of standardisation approaches and modular production methods including demonstrators (workboats); market/marketability analysis and preliminary proof of concept (entirely new vessel concepts and ice breaking technologies). The exploitation of results for the benefit of engineering and manufacturing SMEs will be facilitated."

","19 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Maintaining and extending European industrial leadership, through embedding design-for-excellence in the product lifecycle addresses the second challenge of the ACARE Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. The high development cost and risks of new aircraft (including engine) led to new supply chain models, driven by international risk-sharing partnerships. Transforming potential design concepts into aircraft products (including engines) is a complex, multidisciplinary and collaborative process, which has to take into account in economic, environmental and societal aspects in a holistic manner. Although high fidelity computational tools, new processes and computer resources have radically changed over the last two decades thanks to the opportunities offered by High Performance Computing and Internet of Things, yet part of the supply chain follows the transition from traditional tools and rules to the new multidisciplinary computational reality with caution and slow pace.
Scope:
This topic aims to further develop and validate by both numerical and experimental means the new multidisciplinary and collaborative aircraft design (including engine integration) and optimisation paradigm as well as accelerate its introduction for the benefit of the whole European aircraft supply chain – from integrators and high-tier suppliers to SMEs. The proposals should aim at addressing one or more of the following areas:
Advance further and validate multi-disciplinary and multi-material design and optimisation decision tools for overall aircraft (including engine) architectures based on very large multi-criteria evaluations and on overall performances versus costs of the new products, including their intrinsic levels of safety and security.
Advance further digital interconnection tools as well as rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in aircraft design and manufacturing.
Advance further and validate Computational Solid and Fluid Dynamics (CSFD), Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methodologies towards efficient integration of tools with different levels of fidelity, resolution, and complexity.
Significantly advance user-centric visualisation methods and tools as well as big-data analytics.
Explore further multi-component collaborative testing and certification/air worthiness, with emphasis on virtual and hybrid testing (VHT) methods and tools.
Although the association of TRL to multidisciplinary and collaborative aircraft design capabilities is not uniquely defined, the implementation of the proposed areas of this topic cover in broad sense a TRL spectrum from 2 to 5 (at the end of the project).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Overall, the topic is expected to have significant impact on Flightpath 2050, namely towards “maintaining global leadership” as well as “protecting the environment” challenges. Specific impact is expected in the following areas:
Advanced multidisciplinary and collaborative capabilities for whole aircraft (including engine) along its life cycle.
Significantly reduced aircraft design cycle and higher complexity decision trade-offs.
Development of synergies on visualisation methods and big-data analytics.
Increase the European innovation potential in Aeronautics and Air Transport (AAT) by a more balanced and integrated collaboration of industry, including SMEs and research providers."

Due to the regulatory environment applicable to intercontinental shipping, the first adopters will operate only within national water of a single country or several countries subject to specific agreement. Consequently the first connected and autonomous services are expected to concern inland waterways, short sea shipping, ferries, coastal operations and urban water transport. The challenge is to now develop and demonstrate integrated automation technologies within a real environment.
Scope:
To address these challenges, proposals should address the first bullet and several of the following aspects:
With a focus on first adopters (inland waterways, short sea shipping, ferries coastal operations and urban water transport) develop and demonstrate to TRL7 a fully autonomous vessel within a realistic environment which encompasses all necessary features including collision avoidance, interaction with waterway and/or port infrastructure, interaction with waterborne traffic, connectivity, control, navigation and docking, condition monitoring, smart maintenance and fail safe operation. The differentiators of EGNOS/GALILEO for Autonomous Vessels should be considered.
Assess operability, reliability and failure scenarios for on board systems without human interaction on board, for example; propulsion and machinery systems, auxiliaries, safety systems, navigation, connectivity/communication and if appropriate, their connectivity/controllability from a remote operation centre.
Develop validation, certification and safety assessment methodologies, tools to support autonomous ships and system development.
Safety assessment and demonstrate hazard avoidance using typical scenarios.
Regulatory and legal requirements, including liability regimes, needed to operate autonomous waterborne transport within the environments foreseen for the likely first adopters should be addressed. Also, for intercontinental shipping identify the potential necessary amendments to international conventions. In discussion with important stake holders, identify the technological and regulatory barriers and establish a road map to overcome.
Cybersecurity solutions to enable secure safe and reliable data connectivity that are resistant to both malicious intervention and system failure.
Advance and demonstrate underdeveloped technologies such as for example situational awareness and actions to alert in case of a potential unavoidable collision such as with a fast moving leisure craft.
Address operations and establish a business case for the most promising vessel type and for other services likely to be adopted at an early stage.
Increase public awareness of autonomous waterborne transport and engage in dialogue with relevant stake holders so address social and human factors including those concerning safety, change of skills, socio technic aspects and the impact on employment.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 10 and 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Achieve a breakthrough in automated waterborne transport through demonstration of a fully autonomous vessel targeted towards either inland waterways, short sea, ferry, coastal operation or urban water transport vessel within a relevant environment. Understand the social economic and regulatory factors of autonomous waterborne transport. Enable establishment of the first commercial automated water transport services within 5 years. Enhance European competitiveness and support European jobs and growth.

Global energy aircraft optimisation is vital for both incremental as well as disruptive future aircraft configurations. It is key to modern More Electric Aircraft (MEA) architectures as well as their associated electric systems, which are now steadily replacing conventional pneumatic, hydraulic and mechanical ones. These latter developments are driven by manifold objectives aiming at significant weight savings, reduced maintenance and operating cost. However, increased electrification has also resulted in higher heat dissipation requirements from larger and more complex electrical systems as well as kilometres of copper wire, linking electrical systems, computers, displays, avionics, sensors, actuators, and cabin entertainment.
In addition to modern MEA architectures, unprecedented amounts of ground and flight data are increasingly available for aircrew, Air Traffic Management (ATM), airline operations, health monitoring and passenger connectivity. This adds to the complication, size and weight of electric power and data distribution on-board. Despite the rapidly evolving technology advancements in power electronics, fault tolerant electrical power distribution systems and electric-driven control systems, there is a need to look for low TRL technologies that deviate from established practices and existing certification routes.
Scope:
The main scope of this topic is the development of innovative solutions towards optimising electrical power, data, communication and processing networks in order to achieve weight and cost reduction, harness simplification, versatility and scaling, as well as ensuring high-speed connectivity, without jeopardising safety and security (incl. cybersecurity).
The proposals should address at least two of the following areas:
Next generation modular and distributed power data and wireless networks, enabling cable weight reduction and harness optimisation
Advanced technologies for electrical heat dissipation
Safe, secure, robust and reliable connectivity solutions, including advancements in unified data models, resilience to connection loss and cybersecurity specific barriers.
Advancements in interface standardisation with emphasis on software independency, modularity and portability, as well as standard hardware platforms.
Research on artificial intelligence and data-driven technologies and their applications for future aircraft electric network architectures and systems.
Proposals are expected to establish synergies with Clean Sky, SESAR, ECSEL, Galileo, EGNOS, HPC, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence R&I initiatives.
The proposals may include the explicit commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to assist or to participate in the actions.

In order to substantially offer cost-competitive aviation products and services and in line with Circular Economy concepts, it is essential that production, assembly/de-assembly/reuse and operational costs are further reduced. Sustaining and, wherever practicable, further extending European industrial leadership, through high-value manufacturing technologies as well as Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) and recycling, addresses the second challenge of the ACARE Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda.
The European aircraft supply chain aims towards competitive and sustainable products with high quality standards. Airframe and engine manufacturers require in addition, a step change in the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and flexibility of industrial processes in order to adapt to high-production rates and the ever-increasing complexity of products.
During the last ten years, European R&I has led to significant advancements in conformal morphing of aerodynamic surfaces, structural health monitoring as well as multi-functional structures. These technologies have the potential to further improve the overall aircraft performance whilst lowering their environmental and noise footprints. However, tailoring such advances to fully respond to the entire spectrum of aeronautical requirements – cf. variable production rates, quality targets, automated assembly processes, smart repair as well as ecological dismantling and recycling – is still work in progress.
Scope:
The main target will be to further advance the design, production and field operation of multifunctional and intelligent airframe and engine parts, with an emphasis on efficient, cost-effective and ecological manufacturing, maintenance and recycling. The proposals should address three or more of the following areas:
Innovative manufacturing technologies and processes for flexible wing with morphing capabilities, for control surfaces such as leading and trailing edge as well as winglets, which can adapt their shape in low-speed aircraft configurations.
Innovative joining technologies and damage diagnostics for composites and dissimilar materials in primary and secondary aircraft structures, with high potential to offer substantial benefits towards reduced weight, while allowing for faster and leaner integration and repair.
Advanced quality monitoring and on-line process control, applied to flexible automation of the manufacturing/maintenance/repair processes for increased rates.
Manufacturing processes for the production of composite, multifunctional and intelligent airframe parts, as well as high-temperature and complex-shaped engine parts, covering the whole production chain – cf. process planning, manufacturing and assembly, quality control – with a view to support activities such as supervision and multi-disciplinary optimisation (process-product-performance) of production, smart tooling and on-line quality control.
Multifunctional and intelligent engine parts covering variable geometries in engine structures for optimized performance over the whole cycle, embedded intelligence as well as integrated thermal and electric functionalities
Integrated technologies and methodologies towards next generation health management and monitoring, together with sensor development, wireless networks and data-driven fault detection.
New MRO and recycling technologies for Multifunctional and Intelligent Airframe and engine parts.
Proposals may tackle pre-standardisation, development of best-practice guidelines and processes for the certification of airframe and engine components and assemblies, with particular emphasis on simulation-assisted certification issues. The proposals may include an explicit commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency to assist or to participate in the actions.
The implementation of the proposed areas of this topic may cover TRLs between 2-4.
This topic complements (and should not overlap) retained projects from the 2018 and 2019 topics on “multidisciplinary and collaborative aircraft design tools and processes” and “advancements in aerodynamics and innovative propulsion systems” respectively.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower or higher amounts.

European Ship building, repair, modification and maintenance has been founded upon a technology based competitive advantage which has enabled it to build, improve and maintain the world’s most advanced ships. However, competitors are also becoming more advanced and seeking to enter European high technology markets. Many ship types developed within Europe are now built elsewhere. Also European marine equipment, including environmental technologies are often retrofitted to ships within non-European shipyards. Europe is still a global leader for very high technology ships such as large passenger vessels, but this is a niche and competitors have a strategy to also enter these markets.
The market is particularly challenging for smaller shipyards across Europe who can be agile to develop and maintain niche products or to be integrated within smart supply chains yet do not have significant resources to undertake research and innovation.
Consequently, continuous innovation is needed for the sector to remain competitive and in this respect, lessons and technologies can be drawn for other sectors including automotive, aerospace and IT. For example taking advantage of the latest developments within digital production, advanced robotics and co-bots, machine vision, internet of things, flexible production systems, 3D printing, supply chain integration across multiple sites, skills development and deployment strategies.
Scope:
All following aspects should be addressed:
The development of innovative technologies and systems to enhance the competitiveness of production and maintenance processes within European shipbuilders and ship yards. Where appropriate, technologies transfer from outside of the marine industry shipbuilding, ship maintenance and ship modification sectors, particularly those with potential to reduce CO2 and/or other polluting emissions.
Identification of the necessary related skills development needs and strategies to address these in order to maximise the value from innovative production technologies and practices.
Testing and physical demonstration of the developed technologies to at least TRL 5, including the benchmarking of existing practices, consideration of the environmental impacts and quantification of the additional value from the technology and/or system developed.
Development of business plans and roll out strategies.
IPR and or other measures to reduce leakage of the developed innovations outside of Europe.
Whilst not excluding very large shipyards, an emphasis on the competitive needs of smaller and medium size shipyards across Europe would be welcome in cases where the incremental benefits from Research and Innovation maybe higher.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately
Expected Impact:
With an emphasis on smaller and mediums sized European shipyards and ship builders, to increase competiveness and growth of the European sector, particularly within international markets. Reinforce and grow European employment and the necessary skills development for the successful uptake of innovative production processes and technologies. Improve environmental performance of shipyards and ship builders. Support a multiplication effect within Europe beyond the immediate participants.

Specific challenge: Growing road traffic in Europe entails detrimental effects on the environment and public health to a level that is becoming unsustainable, while generating a large contribution to climate change, this in spite of increasingly stringent emission standards. The challenge is therefore to develop a new generation of transport technologies able to comply with stricter post Euro 6 limits under real world driving conditions while complying with future legislation on CO2 emissions and air quality with significant less noise. At the same time, with the progressive reduction of particle emissions due to the introduction of particle filters, the contribution of brake components wear to air quality deterioration is increasing in relative terms, and it is important to deepen the understanding of the health risk that this constitutes and find ways of reducing these emissions in parallel to engine exhaust ones.
Scope: Proposals for research and demonstration activities should address one or more of the following domains:
      Future spark-ignited non-hybrid engines and their pollution abatement systems for gasoline and bio-based liquid fuels for passenger cars and light freight vehicles focussing on the optimal combination of innovative engine and after-treatment technology and of modelling, sensing on-board emission monitoring and testing to improve the design and control capability.
      Future diesel non-hybrid engines for cars and vans also focussing on the combination of the most appropriate engine and after-treatment technologies and on modelling, sensing on-board emission monitoring and testing to improve the overall design and control capability.
      Preparation of the life-cycle assessment of proposed technology combinations to quantify their environmental impacts along the entire well-to-wheel chain if not already covered by existing studies in the field.
      Low environmental impact brake systems to reduce micro and nano particles emissions while improving the measurement and understanding of their effects on health and the environment.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 to 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Cleaner, more efficient road transport activities through advances in power trains and brake concepts, strengthening the leading role of European industries in the automotive sector. Demonstration vehicles incorporating the new engine technologies must prove, by independent testing, real driving emissions at least below upcoming Euro 6 limits, targeting for the longer term the establishment of a future 'Super Low Emission Vehicles' standard with emission targets which are ambitiously lower than Euro 6. This will help bridge the transition to zero emission vehicles in urban agglomerations. The research will verify the feasibility of these stricter limits and provide evidence in view of the development of European emission standards beyond 2017. At the same time they should demonstrate a 15% improvement in fuel consumption for gasoline and 5% for diesel in comparison to the best vehicles on the market in 2013. For brakes, where no current legislation is applicable, at least a 50% reduction of particle emissions should be demonstrated. Thereby the project can contribute to improving urban air quality in the midterm and strengthen the competitiveness of the EU car industry in this growingly significant market segment.

In addition, the economic situation today is highlighting the importance to study solutions for all segments of the urban bus market, capable to improve the attractiveness through innovative solutions for increased efficiency of the system. In particular energy consumption of auxiliaries in a bus represents a significant part of the overall consumption, heavily impacting energy efficiency performances.
Scope: Key innovative solutions should be developed and tested in real operational scenarios with the joint collaboration of industries and authorities/operators, adopting a system approach. This will entail research and demonstration activities for the vehicle and its interfaces with the transport system addressing all aspects below:
      Testing of strategies for energy and thermal management of buses, in particular auxiliaries such as climate systems for electrified vehicles lacking engine waste heat while excluding powertrain development. Such strategies should be based on real driving measurements of the contribution of auxiliaries to emissions in buses.
      Specific drive assistance technologies, to encourage a driving style aiming at improving both fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
      New solutions for the exterior and interior design and layout of buses (seating, passenger boarding/alighting, modularity and capacity, etc.

More intense and more diverse waterborne traffic, also in areas so far underused, needs specific operational knowledge and information management, technology support as well as advanced vessel and equipment designs that are intrinsically safer and address safety issues holistically and based on goals (which ideally cover the entire life-cycle). The specific challenge is to build the enabling knowledge, develop designs, technologies, and operational procedures and test them in a real world environment with the aim of guaranteeing safe and environmentally sound waterborne operations, also taking into account the increasing use of low flash point fuels.
Scope:
In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
―Waterborne transport operations (including offshore operations), in complex traffic fairways and in extreme environments, simulation modelling and real time information management including big data.
―New and improved vessel and equipment design concepts that offer a clear risk reduction and intrinsic risk mitigation (including human machine interfaces), resilience, integrity, fire resistance and improved survivability in extreme conditions, cargo control including numerical simulations, and cost efficiency considerations, and better salvage and evacuation options.

Safety is embedded in aircraft design and operations, making air transport one of the safest transport modes. EU-funded research has substantially contributed to this outcome. Nevertheless, new risks must be pro-actively identified and mitigated in continuous efforts to maintain the excellent records Europe has achieved over the last decades. This requires introduction of whole range of new system concepts, products and operational practices bringing significant new challenges for the stakeholders and for the European Aviation Safety Agency.
Scope:
The research actions under this topic should support the implementation of the European Aviation Safety Plan by promoting a culture of safety in aviation, by developing and enhancing safety-related products and processes, and notably novel pathways to deliver the safety enhancements in a more cost-effective manner. Proposals should address one or several of the following areas:
―More robust, cost-efficient solutions for the whole life-cycle, based on novel methodologies and technologies towards improving the safety of the air transport system.
―Novel systematic identification of hazards and handling of data and processes tailored to the requirements of aviation that are efficient, effective and acceptable by all the relevant parties in the aviation value-chain.
―An improved understanding of environmental phenomena, their detection and the protection of aircraft in order to increase safety and reliability of operation.

","28 August 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Ensuring and enhancing the safety of waterborne operations is of high importance for the EU since past and recent maritime disasters, and accidents in inland navigation, have shown that accidents come with high costs in terms of loss of life, environmental damage, economic impact, and the overall image and public perception of the waterborne sector. Whilst the safe operations of cargo vessels remain a challenge to be addressed (also in the light of the increasing use of Northern sea routes), the significant and continuing growth in the size of cruise ships and the expansion of their operating areas to remote regions (and particularly difficult environments such as the Arctic) has created a new and increasing risk. More research is needed to develop and demonstrate innovative solutions for ship design and waterborne operations in order to avoid and mitigate passenger risks, ensure high levels of safety, whilst at the same time preserving increased passenger expectations of comfort and on-board amenities.
Enhanced or new technologies for maritime traffic management will be key for safer and more secure operations as well as to lower emissions, whilst supporting a more competitive maritime transport as part of an integrated transport chain. To reduce congestion in ports and port fairways, port traffic guidance systems need to be at the same time cost efficient and easily deployable. Synergies with existing systems should be ensured, with the aim of integrating the use of port traffic guidance tools by all relevant authorities and ensuring the full interoperability between Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems, which monitor vessels, freight and port services.
Scope: Proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
      Safer shipping through innovative conceptual (hull, general arrangement) and detail designs (exterior and interior) of vessels and systems, and through a new approach to emergency response, to risk-based maintenance, and to the human factor.
      New safety devices and their demonstration, including new technologies and operational solutions for the evacuation of large passenger ships, black-out mitigation, fire proofing and making ships more salvage friendly.
      New and improved systems for the surveillance, monitoring and integrated management of waterborne transport and other activities (commercial and non-commercial).
      New and cost effective European Global Navigation Satellite System (European GNSS)-based procedures for port approach, pilotage and guidance, ICT-enabled shipping lanes and maritime services that will reduce the risk of accidents and incidents in port approaches and dense traffic lanes, and minimise both delays and turn-around times.
      For traffic management, solutions that support the extension, integration and optimisation of waterborne transport information and communication systems with the aim of contributing to build a comprehensive ""e-maritime"" environment (including e-Navigation components that are compatible with existing or emerging international standards). They should serve the overall objective of building the European Maritime Transport Space without Barriers allowing waterborne transport (including inland navigation) to be used to the full potential of the integrated intermodal logistic chain. Solutions should also provide the foundation for the deployment of autonomous and actively guided ships as well as the possibility to verify all related safety certificates before the vessel enters the port.
Inputs to EU and international regulatory regimes, standardisation and international research co-operation are expected for the above areas, in particular regarding safety devices and e-Navigation solutions.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 to 9 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: It is expected to:
      Achieve significant improvements in terms of navigational safety and efficiency (in particular emission reductions) along the entire waterborne transport logistic chain, and decrease administrative burdens.
      Facilitate the transfer of new safety concepts from passenger shipping to other areas of maritime operations.
      Show a statistically relevant decrease in the number of fatalities caused by maritime accidents, the number of ship losses and specific incidents such as fires or black-outs accompanied, where relevant, by operational empirical evidence.
      Support the upgrading of international maritime safety regimes through relevant inputs.

Specific challenge: The challenge is to support developments that make new and existing vessels used in maritime operations (including leisure) and in inland navigation significantly more efficient and less polluting through solutions addressing four ship sub-systems: engine, pollution abatement systems, propulsion, energy sources and management including the efficient operation of on-board systems.
Waterborne transport still offers an enormous potential for pollution reduction and energy efficiency gains. The reduction of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions is far removed from the progress made in road transport, particularly in the category of older, small to medium-size vessels which make up a large proportion of intra-European waterborne transport, including inland navigation.
Since vessels have a long life expectancy, developing technologies for clean retrofit and fuel conversion solutions is a key aspect of the challenge.
Scope: In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
      Optimisation of conventional ship engines, including fuel flexibility, new materials, lifetime performance and near zero emissions engines.
      Development of low-maintenance, affordable off-the-shelf retrofit solutions for emission reductions of existing engines.
      Development of Liquified Natural Gas/dual fuel powered engines for small and mid-size ships, including the specific aspects of retrofitting, fuel supply and storage, safety (on-board and on-shore) and classification, and solutions to address the risks of methane slip.
      Design and demonstration of new and improved propulsion means and vessel configurations that include the entire drive train and the propeller and hull optimisation for vessels, including applied research in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
      Use of new energy sources including renewables, alternative fuels, hybrid and electric solutions with the aim to demonstrate the feasibility of the zero or near-zero emissions vessel.
Solutions that are sufficiently close to market take-up so that ship owners will consider these concepts in their future investment plans should be demonstrated. This applies in particular to the existing fleet and retrofitting solutions which must be cost-effective and present a considerable societal return on investment.
Research and innovation efforts should enable pilot applications for new engines, new pollution abatement technologies, new propulsion trains and alternative fuels solutions to enter the market by the end of the research period.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 17 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: It is expected to:
      Achieve efficiency gains and emission reductions that go significantly beyond normal technological progress and the benchmarks of the existing regulatory regimes at lowest costs.
      Achieve fuel efficiency gains of at least 15% for retrofitting per type of solution (engine or propulsion) and at least 30% per type of solution for new concepts.
      Accomplish a 25% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction of, on average, 80% in air pollution compared with Best Available Technology (BAT).
Experience acquired in this innovative field should be broadly made available to ship owners requiring improvements in the environmental performance of their vessel.

","29 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
Despite a number of ITS developments in recent years, several initiatives were undertaken in very specific environments, on an ad-hoc, isolated local or national basis, focusing mostly within a particular transport mode (e.g. Road). On top of this, the cooperative dimension of ITS and the applicability in different settings (e.g. urban, highway, long-distance, etc.) has so far not been sufficiently addressed. The time has come to bring this all together, leverage the achievements of past and current pilots and perform large-scale, real-life demonstrations in a specific (for example highly dense population) or combinations of environments that would not only showcase the current status of development and the large potential of C-ITS, but also reveal key areas for future research, innovation and deployment-related issues. A challenge towards full deployment of C-ITS remains the lack of a detailed testing methodology to validate developments of cooperative services and architectures.
Scope:
An integral part of this challenge is the demonstration of functioning partnerships of multiple stakeholders, namely private (including telecom, infrastructure and transport service operators and service providers, and Original Equipment Manufacturers), public authorities, emergency services, and other stakeholder groups and users, including a proof of actual commitment from the test sites. It should also be supported by thorough post-demonstration impact and cost-benefit assessment and evaluation of C-ITS concepts and technologies, including implementation issues. This will also offer an opportunity for stakeholders and partners to address issues and identify relevant technologies, including European GNSS, and processes to develop operational systems to be kept in place beyond the life of the pilot and lead towards automated transport. In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address several of the following aspects:
―Enable services based on appropriate access and sharing of data leveraging in-vehicle resources and 2-way V2V, V2I, I2I and vulnerable road users connectivity in complex urban environments.
―Enable interoperability across systems including testing and validating standards.
―Demonstrating and validating cross-modal integration (e.g. including crossing) and potential for cross-border inter-operability. Interconnected and independent systems should be developed taking account of existing European and international standards and platforms.
Participation of SMEs with proven experience in these areas is encouraged.
Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US, to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies, particularly for the development of validation methodologies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 11 to 13 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to lead to:
―Improved level of performance for the entire transport system, including more efficient traffic management and safety improvements to enable a more sustainable transport system and foster overall socio-economic development.
―Fully integrated C-ITS concepts in practical, real-life, complex environments being tested and demonstrated.
―Greater collaboration (and partnerships) between multiple stakeholders to deploy applications and facilitate the interoperable interactions across all elements of the transport system, including the use of data from multiple sources (e.g. vehicle, mobile device and infrastructure).
―A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the pilot that demonstrates the value added and economic viability of C-ITS services and solutions for users and other stakeholders.
―Validated results and proven impact on user acceptance, safety, resilience and security with respect to transport demand and the environment.

Specific challenge: Today, new international and intermodal repositories and data pipelines are being created, management systems are deployed and new data mining capabilities are being developed to deal with the data flood needed for logistics decision making. Unfortunately, these data uses involve different information systems, different user requirements, different business models and different deployment trajectories. This constitutes an obstacle for the deployment of pan-European logistics solutions.
The challenge is to develop architectures and open systems for information sharing and valorisation, connecting key stakeholders with information and expertise enabling exploitation on the basis of trusted business agreements and with the relevant authorities (transport authorities and customs being the most eloquent player, but there are also other authorities in relation to health, safety, etc.). These architectures and systems need to accommodate feedback loops that allow for deviation management and corrective and preventive action (CAPA).
Scope:The work should focus on solutions to enable actors to take fast and well-informed decisions inside and cross-companies. This implies that information with the right quality, reliability and content is made available to concerned actors and shared between them even in difficult conditions such as ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship communication. The work will develop an open system and architecture that facilitates real time information exchange and co-operation between agents in the network. It will facilitate collaboration and give good confidence that a significant number of cases of horizontal shipper collaboration can be established within the horizon of the project and have a high expectation of continuance after the project ends.
Proposals should cover the development and integration of several or all of the following issues:
      Mobile communications for secured information exchange among actors (users, service providers, operators, communities) paying particular attention to the role of the driver and the vehicle as part of the vehicle to infrastructure architecture.
      Secure, resilient and trusted communications and information storage and processing including adequate information delivery infrastructures for future customs, other controlling authorities and international transport & trade.
      Provision of position and spatial information regarding goods on the move through European GNSS applications, RFID and 3G/4G (and future network development) services.
      Web-based open platforms to enable information exchange across suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers and retailers without necessitating costly interfaces.
      Technical and organisational guidelines for data and information system governance, technical aspects of IT solutions, business models and processes
      Deployment roadmaps for the application of collaborative systems and services—the legal and business outstanding aspects of such collaborations will be fully assessed and recommendations made as to how to split the costs of collaboration and make it attractive for users to buy into the proposed collaborative system.
      Operational and business models that include the participation of SMEs in the voluntary sharing of data and participation in collaborative business services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 16 to 18 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Cloud-based data and services infrastructure, underpinned by common information models, will give all logistic stakeholders opportunities to collaborate on both an operational and strategic level. The creation of an architecture for logistics information sharing and valorisation will speed up the formation of a single logistics information space in Europe, that is accessible for the transport sector, its users and, in addition, public authorities.
Once deployed, the platform for pan-European logistics application is expected to reduce energy consumption and thus greenhouse gas emissions of the supported supply chains by at least 30% compared to the current situation.

Specific challenge: Although the application of technology has been the primary means of reducing the environmental impacts of transport in the last two decades, technical solutions alone cannot solve all the economic, environmental and societal problems Europe is currently facing.
Multimodal integrated travel information, planning and ticketing services could play a significant role in improving modal integration, thus increasing the attractiveness of collective mobility and transport modes alternative to road and hence be inclusive of user group specific needs (including cyclists or pedestrians). However, the current fragmentation of the landscape in this field, including dispersed knowledge and lack of cooperation between various stakeholders involved in service provision, does not allow the user to easily organise a door-to-door pan-European intermodal trip while taking into account the emissions that will be caused by a specific travel choice.
It also constitutes a major barrier in developing and enacting a truly comprehensive and cohesive strategy for ITS deployment in Europe.
Scope: Proposals should focus on one or several of the following domains:
      Interoperability and linking of the existing services, including necessary interfaces, in order to achieve the widest possible geographical and modal coverage to enable an open single European market for mobility services. The scope of the work should extend towards full-scale early take up and solutions should be tested on large scale.
      Developing EU-wide common minimum standards for interoperable navigation and ticketing services, thereby facilitating regional solutions compatible with generic nomad devices (smart phones etc.).
      Exploring more effective and more efficient cooperation and decision making mechanisms between stakeholders, including coordination of the existing European, national and regional initiatives, to foster EU-wide consolidation and deployment of high-quality integrated multimodal travel information, planning and ticketing services. This could encompass setting up a cooperation platform.
      Exploring mechanisms and structures for consensus building among stakeholders to foster EU-wide consolidation and deployment of cooperative ITS. This could encompass setting up a cooperation platform.
      Exploring ways to overcome the fragmentation of knowledge with regard to ITS deployment across the EU, by setting up a dedicated observatory monitoring all major developments in ITS deployment across Europe, to facilitate fact-based policy making at all levels and to engage a large number of local authorities and industrial stakeholders. Special attention should be paid to broad coverage both in geographical and thematic terms.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million each for Research and Innovation Actions would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The work should contribute to:
      Better modal integration by providing travellers with information about various options to travel from A to B according to their needs, thus improving European citizens' mobility in general with increased awareness of the ecological footprint of their journey.
      Increased travel time reliability.
      More efficient use of the existing transport infrastructure.
      More inclusive transport services across Europe by better responding to the special needs of population groups such as the elderly and disabled travellers.
      Better informed and more efficient policies for ITS deployment based on consolidated knowledge on the state of play across Europe and thus accelerated roll-out of the related services and technologies.

The European transport network is highly developed, even if not fully balanced between regions and countries. Whilst some links are still missing and an effort is needed to complete trans-European connections, other corridors and nodes face increasing problems of congestions and under-capacity compared with traffic evolution. Key to improving capacity and availability of the existing transport infrastructure network are innovative systems and processes for re-engineering, retrofitting and upgrading that support a transition to zero intrusion from inspection, construction and maintenance (less, faster and better planned interventions with maximum safety for the workers) and drastically increase the productivity of the system.
Scope:
In order to meet these challenges, proposals should address one or several of the following aspects, according the specific situation addressed:
―Re-engineering/re-design methods to adapt the network to new needs and ensure higher efficiency.
―Innovative design and construction methods that are fast, cost-efficient, using low maintenance and environment-friendly materials and flexible enough to accommodate increasing/changing demand. In particular, implementing advanced construction concepts and processes for corridors and hubs, i.e. flexible design and modular concepts, and advanced predictive models.
―Assessment of the multimodal network capacity in view of optimised use and future planning, taking due consideration of the uncertainty of demand evolution.
Attention is to be paid to the design, construction and operation of corridors, terminals, hubs and gateways as points of interchange (within the same mode) or transfer (between the modes). Airports of all sizes and operations are included. The action could also address synchro-modality over key transport corridors, where inland waterways represent a major challenge.
SME active participation is strongly encouraged.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation, in particular with Neighbouring Partner Countries, is encouraged. Proposals should take into consideration research actions already funded under the INFRAVATION ERA-NET Plus.

Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to contribute to more optimal use of the multimodal transport system including avoidance of over-dimensioning of the physical network whilst reducing congestion and overload of specific network components and accommodating future demand; major progress is expected regarding accessibility and operational efficiency of multimodal hubs. Increase of the infrastructure performance will also contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the sector and to minimise effects on climate change via the improvement of construction methods and traffic smoothness.

Specific challenge: The White Paper ‘Towards a Single European Transport Area’ aims at the completion of efficient, interoperable and integrated transport infrastructure network by 2050. These long term goals can only be achieved when infrastructure innovation, supported by targeted up-stream research activities, is deployed at integrated system level. However, testing and implementing solutions at system level is much more challenging than at component level in view of the number of technological and organisational parameters involved, their interdependency, the scale of investment and the potential impact on stakeholders.
Although many technological solutions relative to transport infrastructure are already available for all transport modes, the challenge consists in overcoming highly fragmented demand. Decision-makers (mainly from the public sector) are often unaware of the availability and efficiency of highly innovative solutions and are not familiar with the use of public procurement for innovation.
Scope: Actions should lead to the improvement and capacity building in the field of public purchasing of innovative solutions in transport infrastructure leading to implementation of best available solutions on cross-border TEN-T network and other business cases representative of typical European situations. Proposals should be driven by clearly identified procurement needs of infrastructure owners (the procurers), including life-cycle and cost-benefit assessments and environmental impacts under the life-cycle perspective, and should effectively control budget across various European regions. The work should contribute to the revision /development of relevant standards and regulatory framework, and to study strategies oriented to favour the innovation in transport sector. Good practices should be made available for replication.

Specific challenge: Infrastructure owners and operators need to ensure the best possible return from increasingly limited transport infrastructure investment funds. The main challenge is to overcome the lack of a common framework for governance, management and finance of transport infrastructure projects (including methodologies and modelling) with the aim to enable transparent, risk-based optimisation of investments within and across the modes. This includes issues such as resilience against climate change and other disturbances. Additionally, it is necessary to enhance the industry's practices and capacities in order to raise the productivity, quality and timeliness of infrastructure projects.
Scope: Proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
      Development of whole system planning environments (based e.g. on virtual design concepts such as BIM - Building Information Modelling) to support the streamlined delivery of infrastructure projects from concept to deployment. In this respect, the rail sector deserves particular attention.
      Innovative, harmonised and lean procurement processes, accompanied by adequate monitoring systems, contracting and tendering methods; management tools to provide help in innovation delivery.
      Solutions for advanced infrastructure capacity planning and modelling for all transport modes.
      Solutions for optimal cost-effectiveness, including network resilience, mapping of climate risk hot-spots, reducing environmental impacts, including under climate change, together with appropriate adaptation measures and cross-modal implementation strategies.
      Solutions for advanced asset management, advanced investment strategies and innovation governance, including smart monitoring systems (such as Structural Health Monitoring) and adequate indicators for cost and quality.
SME active participation is strongly encouraged.

Specific challenge: Infrastructure owners and operators need to ensure the best possible return from increasingly limited transport infrastructure investment funds. The main challenge is to overcome the lack of a common framework for governance, management and finance of transport infrastructure projects (including methodologies and modelling) with the aim to enable transparent, risk-based optimisation of investments within and across the modes. This includes issues such as resilience against climate change and other disturbances. Additionally, it is necessary to enhance the industry's practices and capacities in order to raise the productivity, quality and timeliness of infrastructure projects.
Scope: Proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:
      Development of whole system planning environments (based e.g. on virtual design concepts such as BIM - Building Information Modelling) to support the streamlined delivery of infrastructure projects from concept to deployment. In this respect, the rail sector deserves particular attention.
      Innovative, harmonised and lean procurement processes, accompanied by adequate monitoring systems, contracting and tendering methods; management tools to provide help in innovation delivery.
      Solutions for advanced infrastructure capacity planning and modelling for all transport modes.
      Solutions for optimal cost-effectiveness, including network resilience, mapping of climate risk hot-spots, reducing environmental impacts, including under climate change, together with appropriate adaptation measures and cross-modal implementation strategies.
      Solutions for advanced asset management, advanced investment strategies and innovation governance, including smart monitoring systems (such as Structural Health Monitoring) and adequate indicators for cost and quality.
SME active participation is strongly encouraged.
The work will focus either on further advancements in knowledge where technological progress is still needed (Research and Innovation Actions), or on implementing innovative technologies in real life conditions via large scale demonstration actions (Innovation Actions). The need for strengthening the network between infrastructure owners and operators in view of enhancing the effectiveness of the sector could be approached through appropriate coordination schemes (Coordination and Support Actions).
Expected impact:
      Accelerated delivery of transport infrastructure through improved, transparent and harmonised investment decision making at a European level, balancing performance with cost (in terms of Total Cost of Ownership) and risk.
      Improved predictive capacity and maintenance planning of the European transport infrastructure network, including determination of the optimal balance between long-term renewal and short-term maintenance.
      Improved assessment of risks related to impacts of climate change and evaluation of possible measures of adaption.
      Faster adoption of innovation as a result of reinforced coordinated public-private partnerships, for example through (pre-competitive) innovation procurement procedures.

Specific challenge:Increasing the performance of multi-modal transport infrastructurecan be achieved through improving the productivity of the assets. In this context, key in the future will be to reduce drastically traffic disruptions of transport flows from inspection, construction and maintenance activities to accommodate increasing/changing traffic demand. This means fewer, faster, more sustainable and better planned interventions with maximum safety for the workers and other traffic participants.
Scope:Proposals should address one or several of the following activities:
      Advanced, quick, cost-effective and flexible (modular) design, manufacturing, construction, maintenance, rehabilitation and retrofitting systems/techniques and materials.
      Self-monitoring, self-reporting, non-intrusive inspection and testing methods, including advanced predictive modelling.
      Reuse and recycling methods for low energy construction and maintenance of existing infrastructure.
Research in this domain should aim at validation of innovative solutions, targeting specific European geographical areas where either new construction for the completion of an efficient transport network is needed, or advanced maintenance systems are necessary to improve and extend the capacity of the existing network.
Proposals could also include, when suitable, novel design concepts, such as shared space, self-explaining infrastructure, forgiving road sides.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation with third countries is encouraged, both with international partners willing to share advanced know-how, and with third parties (in particular neighbouring countries) needing technology transfer.
SME active participation is strongly encouraged with the aim of fostering open innovation.
New procedures and technologies in using Green Infrastructure to make transport infrastructure more resilient, less-carbon intense, maximising multiple ecosystem services and minimising fragmentation effects should be developed and tested.

Underwater noise from shipping and boats impacts upon the behaviour and health of water organisms in rivers and at sea, including marine mammals. However, despite previous research, the environmental impacts from effects and the propagation of underwater noise at different amplitudes and frequencies remain poorly understood and largely unquantified. Furthermore, there has been comparatively few studies to better understand the potential noise reduction measures that could be applied to both existing and future vessels.
Scope:
All following aspects should be addressed:
Develop standardised methods to measure and assess the impacts from underwater noise generated by shipping and boats. Consideration should be given to the acute and cumulative effects on different water species in rivers and at sea including marine mammals.
Establish a stakeholder group of researchers within the domain of underwater noise assessment and mitigation together with other relevant actors including for example NGO’s, marine and waterway authorities, industry, ship owners, naval industry etc. Use this group to support methodology and standards development as well as its wide spread take up.
Identify, quantify and validate any negative impacts from different types and amplitudes of underwater noise from shipping and boats.
Propose the most effective feasible solutions to mitigate the effects of underwater noise and to establish appropriate limits.

Increasingly strict emission standards apply to shipping around the coastlines of many developed countries. Presently these are mainly focussed on SOx, but in future, reflecting health concerns, increasingly strict limits are likely to address NOx and particulate matter. A variety of compliant solutions can meet present, and may be able to meet emerging and future standards. However, some of these solutions may lead to secondary impacts and new waste streams. The principal challenge is to better understand the comprehensive environmental impacts from the wide scale adoption of a range of potential emission reduction solutions together with any secondary effects on the on the marine environment. As well as building upon current state of the art modelling (e.g by IIASA and EMSA[1]), appropriate Earth Observation data and information provided by the Copernicus programme and its Marine Environmental Monitoring Service maybe taken into consideration.
Scope:
To address these challenges, proposals should address all of the following aspects:
Assess the range of emission reduction technologies and designs which may be deployed, consider their cost benefits.
Experimentally characterise waste streams from emission control technologies, identifying the substances and quantities involved.
Considering several possible scenarios for the wide scale adoption of different emission control technologies depending on fuel costs, availabilities service needs etc model the disbursement of to the marine environment around the European coastline. Modelling should consider the main shipping routes, use real ship traffic, hydrological and weather data and the variety of constituents discharged. Consideration should be given to vulnerable regions such as estuaries and enclosed waters.
For the scenarios modelled assess the environmental impact on the marine environment in the medium and long term including consideration of any potential bio accumulation.
Considering SOx, NOx and particulate matter, assess and propose sustainable cost effective emission reduction strategies and technologies. Assessments should also include consideration of waste stream costs and their cost effective treatment.

Surveying the sea floor remains an expensive activity, typically requiring manned research vessels towing specialised sonar devices with the remote oceans. Consequently the sea bed remains largely unknown. Recent developments in autonomous technology enables the potential possibility of an underwater vehicle which can operate with a high level of independence and survey large areas without the cost of an accompanying support vessel.

To address this challenge, proposals should address the following aspects:
Develop and demonstrate to TRL5 an autonomous sea bed survey vehicle (if appropriate including its docking and reloading device) which can operate within the deep oceans for extended periods without the need for a close support vessel.
Energy and prolusion systems capable of supporting several months of autonomous survey operation over large areas.
Minimising deep sea deployment and recovery costs by for example enabling deployment by air and return to base features.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Objective:
The COFUND scheme aims to stimulate regional, national or international programmes to foster excellence in researchers' training, mobility and career development, spreading the best practices of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions.
This will be achieved by co-funding new or existing regional, national, and international programmes to open up to, and provide for, international, intersectoral and interdisciplinary research training, as well as transnational and cross-sectoral mobility of researchers at all stages of their career.
Scope:
Each proposal funded under the COFUND scheme must have a sole beneficiary that will be responsible for the availability of the necessary complementary funds to execute the proposal.
Applicants submit multi-annual proposals for new or existing doctoral programmes or fellowship programmes which are expected to have an impact on enhancing research- and innovation related human resources on regional, national or international level.
Applicants having benefited from COFUND under previous calls (under the Seventh Framework Programme or under Horizon 2020) must explain how their proposal adds value in relation to the excellence and/or the impact award criteria, compared to their previous grant(s). As an example, added value could take the form of increased networking with organisations in less represented countries or capacity building measures there to further structure the European Research Area.
Researchers supported under this scheme shall comply with the mobility rules of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions.
Limitations regarding the researchers' origin and destination should be avoided. Support cannot be awarded to researchers who are already permanently employed by the organisation hosting them.
Proposed programmes are encouraged to cover all research disciplines (""bottom-up""), but can also focus on specific disciplines. In this case the range of covered disciplines should allow reasonable flexibility for the researchers.
Programmes that prioritise specific research disciplines based on national or regional Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies) can also be supported. Synergies with the European Structural & Investment Funds (ESIF) are encouraged[1].
COFUND takes the form of:
A) Doctoral programmes
Doctoral programmes address the development and broadening of the research competencies of early-stage researchers. The training follows the EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral Training. Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship will be supported. Collaboration with a wider set of partner organisations, including from the non-academic sector, which may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training in research or transferable skills, as well as innovative and interdisciplinary elements of the proposed programme, will be positively taken into account during the evaluation.
Each researcher must be enrolled in a doctoral programme. Attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based. The vacancy notice must include the minimum gross salary offered to the researcher, as set out in the proposal.
B) Fellowship programmes
Fellowship programmes fund individual research training and career development fellowships for experienced researchers. The programmes supported should have regular selection rounds following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between the researchers applying. The selections should be based on open, widely advertised competition (the vacancy notice must include the minimum gross salary offered to the researcher, as set out in the proposal), with transparent international peer review and the selection of candidates on merit. Mobility types supported by fellowship programmes may be similar to the ones supported under Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships. On top of transnational mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Fellowship programmes should be based on individual-driven mobility, i.e., researchers should be able to freely choose a research topic and the appropriate organisation to host them, fitting their individual needs.
Given that the aim of the co-funded fellowship programmes is the support of individual fellows, research teams will not be funded.
Expected Impact:
At researcher level:
Augment and diversify the set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, that will lead to improved employability and career prospects both in and outside academia
Forge new mind sets and approaches to research and innovation work through interdisciplinary and intersectoral experience
Enhance networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact
At organisation level:
Increasing the attractiveness of the participating organisation(s) towards talented researchers
Boosting research and innovation output among participating organisations
Strengthening of international, intersectoral and interdisciplinary collaborative networks that will reinforce the organisation's position and visibility at a global level, but also at a regional/national level by helping them become key actors and partners in the local socio-economic ecosystems
At system level:
Aligning of practices and policies in the context of the EU Human Resources Strategy for Researchers (HRS4R), enhanced implementation of the Charter and Code and the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training at regional, national or international level
Supporting the practice of Open Science through targeted training activities
Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in Europe
Improvement in the working and employment conditions for researchers in Europe at all levels of their career, starting from the doctoral stage
Strengthening of Europe's human capital base in research and innovation and structuring of a stronger European Research Area
Increase in Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for research and innovation

As an example, added value could take the form of increased networking with organisations in less represented countries or capacity building measures there to further structure the European Research Area.
Researchers supported under this scheme shall comply with the mobility rules of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions.
Limitations regarding the researchers' origin and destination should be avoided. Support cannot be awarded to researchers who are already permanently employed by the organisation hosting them.
Proposed programmes are encouraged to cover all research disciplines (""bottom-up""), but can also focus on specific disciplines. In this case the range of covered disciplines should allow reasonable flexibility for the researchers.
Programmes that prioritise specific research disciplines based on national or regional Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3 strategies) can also be supported. Synergies with the European Structural & Investment Funds (ESIF) are encouraged[1].
COFUND takes the form of:
A) Doctoral programmes
Doctoral programmes address the development and broadening of the research competencies of early-stage researchers. The training follows the EU Principles on Innovative Doctoral Training. Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship will be supported. Collaboration with a wider set of partner organisations, including from the non-academic sector, which may provide hosting or secondment opportunities or training in research or transferable skills, as well as innovative and interdisciplinary elements of the proposed programme, will be positively taken into account during the evaluation.
Each researcher must be enrolled in a doctoral programme. Attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based. The vacancy notice must include the minimum gross salary offered to the researcher, as set out in the proposal.
B) Fellowship programmes
Fellowship programmes fund individual research training and career development fellowships for experienced researchers. The programmes supported should have regular selection rounds following fixed deadlines or regular cut-off dates, allowing fair competition between the researchers applying. The selections should be based on open, widely advertised competition (the vacancy notice must include the minimum gross salary offered to the researcher, as set out in the proposal), with transparent international peer review and the selection of candidates on merit. Mobility types supported by fellowship programmes may be similar to the ones supported under Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowships. On top of transnational mobility, applicants are encouraged to include elements of cross-sectoral mobility and interdisciplinarity into their programmes. Fellowship programmes should be based on individual-driven mobility, i.e., researchers should be able to freely choose a research topic and the appropriate organisation to host them, fitting their individual needs.
Given that the aim of the co-funded fellowship programmes is the support of individual fellows, research teams will not be funded.
Expected Impact:
At researcher level:
Augment and diversify the set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, that will lead to improved employability and career prospects both in and outside academia
Forge new mind sets and approaches to research and innovation work through interdisciplinary and intersectoral experience
Enhance networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact
At organisation level:
Increasing the attractiveness of the participating organisation(s) towards talented researchers
Boosting research and innovation output among participating organisations
Strengthening of international, intersectoral and interdisciplinary collaborative networks that will reinforce the organisation's position and visibility at a global level, but also at a regional/national level by helping them become key actors and partners in the local socio-economic ecosystems
At system level:
Aligning of practices and policies in the context of the EU Human Resources Strategy for Researchers (HRS4R), enhanced implementation of the Charter and Code and the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training at regional, national or international level
Supporting the practice of Open Science through targeted training activities
Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in Europe
Improvement in the working and employment conditions for researchers in Europe at all levels of their career, starting from the doctoral stage
Strengthening of Europe's human capital base in research and innovation and structuring of a stronger European Research Area
Increase in Europe's attractiveness as a leading destination for research and innovation
Better quality research and innovation contributing to Europe's competitiveness and growth, including by supporting regional or national smart specialisation strategies when appropriate.

","08 April 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Objective:
The goal of the Individual Fellowships is to enhance the creative and innovative potential of experienced researchers, wishing to diversify their individual competence in terms of skill acquisition through advanced training, international and intersectoral mobility.
Individual Fellowships provide opportunities to researchers of any nationality to acquire and transfer new knowledge and to work on research and innovation in Europe (EU Member States and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries) and beyond. The scheme particularly supports the return and (re)integration of European researchers from outside Europe and those who have previously worked here, as well as researchers displaced by conflict outside the EU and Horizon 2020 Associated Countries. It also promotes the career restart of individual researchers who show great potential.
Scope:
Support is foreseen for individual, trans-national fellowships awarded to the best or most promising researchers of any nationality, for employment in EU Member States or Horizon 2020 Associated Countries. It is based on an application made jointly by the researcher and the beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sectors.
Only one proposal per individual researcher per call will be evaluated.
Fellowships take the form of European Fellowships or Global Fellowships. European Fellowships are held in EU Member States or Horizon 2020 Associated Countries and are open to researchers either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The researcher must comply with the rules of mobility in the country where the European Fellowship is held.
Direct return to and long-term reintegration of researchers in Europe, including in their country of origin, is supported via a separate multi-disciplinary reintegration panel of the European Fellowships. For the reintegration panel, there must be direct mobility to the country of the beneficiary in Europe from a third country (compulsory national service and/or short stays such as holidays are not taken into account).
Support to individuals to resume research in Europe after a career break, e.g. after parental leave or due to recent migration, is ensured via a separate multi-disciplinary career restart panel of the European Fellowships. To qualify for the career restart panel, researchers must not have been active in research for a continuous period of at least 12 months within the 18 months immediately prior to the deadline for submission.
Researchers seeking to work on research and innovation projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector will be supported via a separate multi-disciplinary society and enterprise panel of the European Fellowships. The objective of this panel is to facilitate career moves between the academic and non-academic sectors, to stimulate innovation, and to open attractive career opportunities for researchers outside academia.
The Widening Fellowships implemented through Work Programme part 15, Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation, provide specific support to researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country[1]. This will help spread excellence and close the still apparent research and innovation gap within Europe.
Global Fellowships are based on a secondment to a third country and a mandatory 12 month return period to a European host. The researcher must comply with the rules of mobility in the country where the Global Fellowship secondment takes place, not for the country of the return phase.
Researchers receiving an Individual Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase in Europe, notably in the non-academic sector, within the overall duration of their fellowship. For a fellowship of 18 months or less, the secondment phase may last up to three months. For a fellowship of more than 18 months, the secondment phase may last up to six months. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. The secondment should significantly add to the impact of the fellowship. In the Global Fellowships, such a secondment can also take place at the start of the action at the beneficiary or a partner organisation in Europe for a maximum of 3 months, allowing the researcher to spend time there before moving on to a partner organisation in a third country.
A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research or innovation objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences.
Researchers participating in the Individual Fellowships may opt to work part-time in order to pursue supplementary activities. These might include creating a company, or engaging in advanced studies not related to the MSCA grant. Any supplementary activities carried out part-time in parallel with the MSCA action must be agreed upon by the researcher and the beneficiary.
Expected Impact:
At researcher level:
Increased set of skills, both research-related and transferable ones, leading to improved employability and career prospects both in and outside academia
Increase in higher impact R&I output, more knowledge and ideas converted into products and services
Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society
At organisation level:
Enhanced cooperation and stronger networks
Better transfer of knowledge between sectors and disciplines
Boosting of R&I capacity among participating organisations
At system level:
Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers in Europe
Strengthening of Europe's human capital base in R&I with more entrepreneurial and better trained researchers

Facilitate trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (MSCA), with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors.
Scope:
Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of MSCA. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training sessions linked to MSCA as well as to Responsible Research and Innovation, twinning schemes, etc. Special attention will be given to enhancing the competence of MSCA NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. It will also be encouraged to build up cooperation with other networks to increase visibility to potential beneficiaries, especially in the non-academic sector.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to MSCA and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under 'Science with and for Society'.
Only NCP organisations from EU Member States, Associated Countries, and third countries which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries or third countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic. The maximum duration of support will be three years from the starting date specified in the grant agreement.
Expected Impact:
An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, therefore helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of submitted proposals.
A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
International cooperation"

Proposals under this topics should cover only one of the following two aspects:
1 - For information provision and promotion programmes aiming at increasing the awareness and recognition of Union quality schemes mentioned in Article 5(4)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014:
The objective is to increase the awareness and recognition of the Union quality schemes, namely:
(a) quality schemes: protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) and optional quality terms;
(b) organic production method;
(c) the logo for quality agriculture products specific to the outermost regions of the Union.
One of the expected results is to increase the levels of recognition of the logo associated with the Union quality schemes by the European consumers. According to special Eurobarometer (No 473), only 18% of Europeans consumers recognize the logos of products that benefit from a protected designation of origin (PDO) or a protected geographical indication (PGI), and 15% recognize the Traditional Specialty Guaranteed, these being the main Union quality schemes. Although awareness of the organic farming logo has increased by four points since 2015, still only 27% of European consumers recognize the EU logo of organic farming.
The expected ultimate impact is to increase awareness of the Union quality schemes and to enhance the competitiveness and consumption of Union agri-food products registered under a Union quality scheme, raise their profile and increase their market share.
2 - For information provision and promotion programmes highlighting the specific features of agricultural methods in the Union and the characteristics of EU agri-food products and quality schemes mentioned in Article 5(4)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1144/2014:
The objective is to highlight at least one of the specific features of agricultural production methods in the Union, particularly in terms of food safety, traceability, authenticity, labelling, nutritional and health aspects (including proper dietary practices and responsible consumption of eligible alcoholic beverages), animal welfare, respect for the environment and sustainability, and the characteristics of agricultural and food products, particularly in terms of their quality, taste, diversity or traditions.
The expected impact is to increase the awareness of the merits of Union agricultural products by the consumers and to enhance the competitiveness and consumption of the concerned Union agri-food products, raise their profile and increase their market share."

This topic covers Information provision and promotion programmes aiming at highlighting the sustainable aspect of the rice production.
Products eligible under this topic are those defined in Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, part II.
The objective is to highlight the sustainable aspect of rice sector. Rice production in Europe has a particular environmental dimension, being at the heart of the preservation of certain wetlands. Rice cultivation is a sensitive and specific practice at European level, since it is produced in areas where there are few crop alternatives. Its preservation and improvement contribute to the sustainability of rice producing regions, by playing an active role in maintaining rural areas, protecting nature and preserving biodiversity. Actions shall highlight the environmental sustainability of the production, stressing its beneficial role for climate action and the environment.
Actions will for example address how the product(s) promoted and its/their production method(s) contribute to:
climate change mitigation (e.g. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions) and/or adaptation; biodiversity, conservation and sustainable use (e.g. landscape, genetic resources); sustainable water management (e.g. water use efficiency, reduction of nutrients or pesticides load); sustainable soil management (e.g. erosion control; nutrient balance; prevention of acidification, salinization). They may also highlight the role of the rice production in providing employment in rural areas.
The expected ultimate impact is to increase the awareness of the merits of Union agricultural products by the European consumers and to enhance the competitiveness and consumption of the concerned Union agri-food products, raise their profile and increase their market share.
NOTE: proposals on rice for the internal market are also eligible under Topic A. In in that case, to avoid overlaps, the message of rice proposals under Topic A shall be different than the sustainable aspect of the rice production (except if rice is associated with (an)other product(s))."

Specific challenge: The European Union (EU) has a strong leadership in reactor design and operation responding to stringent safety requirements from regulators and seeks to foster convergence of nuclear safety approaches. The EU is also at the forefront of the development of innovative reactor designs with even higher safety characteristics. Today's major research challenge is evidently to reinforce research cooperation on reactor safety at EU level and worldwide.
Scope: At EU level, this reinforced cooperation will, first of all, involve Members States' national research programmes while also taking into account the priorities of the strategic research and innovation agenda of SNETP[1] and NUGENIA[2]. The Euratom funding will be devoted to supporting the continuous improvement of nuclear safety of the existing reactor fleet and to optimising the safety characteristics in the design of future reactors, e.g. by implementation of passive safety features and by increasing the redundancy and diversity or by performing experimental tests and developing advanced simulation tools.The focus will be on actions increasing the knowledge basis on reactor life-time management issues relevant to safety (e.g. integrity of structural components, containment, irradiation and corrosion issues, …), as well as on those promoting safety culture and providing guidance for severe accident management (especially on issues arising after the Fukushima accident e.g. safety of fuel storage, hydrogen explosion, containment behaviour, corium/debris coolability and interactions, …). The Euratom funding will be dedicated to topics where national programme priorities converge and where European added value is obvious and maximised. International cooperation activities would be beneficial in this area and will be considered during evaluation.
Expected impact: In the short term, this action will provide the knowledge basis for developing robust national and EU policies in the field of nuclear reactor safety, while also helping interacting with stakeholders and civil society on nuclear reactor safety. In the medium term this research will further improve the safety of nuclear reactors in Europe and worldwide through increased resistance of safety relevant equipment and better safety culture. It will also reinforce the EU strong leadership in reactor design and operation responding to stringent safety requirements from regulators and seek to foster European cooperation on nuclear safety approaches. In so doing, the EU will remain at the forefront of the development of innovative reactor designs with even higher safety characteristics.
Type of action: Research and innovation actions.
 Additional information: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom of between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","Research and Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: A shortage of Molybdenum-99 has occurred mainly as a result of the low availability of research reactor facility and of the extensive replacement of highly enriched uranium fuel by low enriched one to address nuclear proliferation concerns. This has been at the origin of the European Observatory on the Supply of Medical Radioisotopes[1], created in order to organise the availability of this essential radiopharmaceutical product.
Research and innovation should be undertaken to support the replacement of highly enriched uranium fuel and targets by low enriched and high density ones. The issue for the fuel is the sufficient performance and safe operation of the reactor, notably for preserving the fuel elements from meltdown, e.g. in using an appropriate conditioning. The issue for the targets is to achieve a sufficient number of fission reactions that produce Molybdenum-99 and to get a high quality pharmaceutical product.
Scope: This research and innovation will focus on developing new kinds of high density uranium fuel and targets bearing in mind their thermal, mechanical and chemical behaviour and their suitability for use in different research reactors. This will involve inter alia the investigation of heat resistance, preserved microstructure, reduced oxidation and thermal fatigue of high density fuel and targets by appropriate coating. Fuel and target fabrication will be studied in view of testing their properties under thermal stress before and after irradiation. International cooperation could be beneficial in this area.
Impact: The cost effective supply of high density and low enriched uranium fuel and targets will allow the more efficient use of research reactors in Europe for the purpose of energy research and the production of medical radioisotopes like Molybdenum-99. This will contribute to the addressing of key challenges of Horizon 2020 in the sectors of energy and health. The principal impact of this action will be the prevention of future crises in the supply of Molybdenum-99.
Type of action: Research and innovation actions.
Additional information: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","Research and Innovation action
","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The elimination or transmutation of minor actinides is a key to the sustainability of the back-end of the fuel cycle. Further research is needed in order to demonstrate the feasibility of transmutation of high-level waste at industrial scale. Advanced experimental tests as well as numerical simulation tools will be required to conduct this interdisciplinary research encompassing basic as well as applied sciences. The technological and economic performance of transmutation in a fast neutron facility should also take into account the other possible uses of the equipment, e.g. for the production of radioisotopes or material testing for nuclear fission and fusion applications.
Scope: This research should contribute to the further development of state-of-the-art critical or sub-critical fast neutron installations for transmutation. Due consideration should be given to the actual effectiveness of the transmutation process, as for example by using accelerator driven systems, as well as the safety and reliability of the facility and the demonstration of the industrial feasibility of the process. The development of innovative fuel and targets for the transmutation of minor actinides should also be considered in this proposal, as well as the development of advanced experiments and numerical simulation tools. Full advantage should be taken of existing knowledge and competence. International cooperation could be beneficial in this area.
Expected impact: Even if a final repository would still be needed, the partitioning and transmutation would drastically reduce the radiotoxicity, the heat production and package volume of high-level radioactive wastes, thereby easing the long-term safety of a final repository. This research will allow pursuing this objective by using state-of-the-art technology, notably in terms of efficiency and safety of the process.
Type of action: Research and innovation actions.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A number of current Generation II reactors should continue operating for a few decades and Generation III should still be in operation one century from now. The objective of this action is to complement, where needed, earlier investment in research regarding the safety and reliability of Generation II and III reactors, with particular attention to the new requirements of the amended Nuclear Safety Directive (Council Directive 2014/87/Euratom of 8 July 2014 amending the Directive 2009/71/Euratom establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations).
Scope:
Safety and reliability improvements are to be sought in a number of areas, with due consideration to the NUGENIA roadmap. The action should address the remaining technology gaps and encompass experiments as well as numerical simulations. It should focus on the integrity of structural components in ageing reactors, the knowledge basis for lifetime management of the reactor islands and the management of severe accidents. This can involve inter alia: probabilistic safety assessment, uncertainty analyses, the identification and understanding of deterioration mechanisms, the assessment of the need for and feasibility of retrofitted safety systems, the development of tools to establish safety cases for Long Term Operation, study of the prevention of hydrogen production, the improved modelling of reactor behaviour, the methodology of seismic risk assessment, the evaluation of accident-tolerant fuel, the improved assessment of fire risks and the safety demonstration of digital I&C equipment and their practical implementation. All aspects of meltdown, as a key issue of Generation-II and -III reactors, are also considered to be in scope. Results obtained as part of this action should be made public. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for topics NFRP 1 to 5 will be ranked in a single ranking list.
Expected Impact:
This action will help industrial stakeholders to develop efficient solutions in response to the new requirements of the amended Nuclear Safety Directive. It will result in reinforcement of the safety features of the Generation-II and -III EU nuclear reactor fleet. This should improve the market profile of EU-based reactor designs and strengthen the competitiveness of the EU nuclear sector through promoting an excellent level of safety in response to market requirements and trends.

Specific challenge: One of the main goals of Euratom from its inception in developing research and training programmes is to maintain nuclear expertise by generating knowledge (research) and developing competences (training). A key concern of industry and policy makers (in particular, regulators) world-wide is that human resources could be at risk, especially because of high retirement expectations and low renewal rates in countries with a tradition of nuclear installations and a strong need for further specialised training in emerging nuclear energy countries. More specifically, within the EU, the nuclear education and training community is faced with the challenges of lifelong learning and cross border mobility. This action should be undertaken under the umbrella of the Technology Platforms and other authoritative expert bodies concerned.
Scope: Special attention is to be devoted to the further implementation, in the nuclear and relevant medical and industrial sectors, of the EU policies stemming from the Bologna and Copenhagen processes[1]. Education and training organisations (notably at university or equivalent level) are invited to submit proposals in close collaboration with the “end–users”, i.e. industry, research and regulatory organisations. A special effort should be devoted to the development of European Masters and summer schools for the continuous professional development of researchers and other private/public actors. The implementation of the action will need coordination involving research and educational institutions, practitioners in the respective area, regulators, equipment manufacturers and stakeholders from different Member States. Particular attention shall be paid to gender balance in the composition of project teams.
Expected impact: This activity will accelerate and optimise the development of competences in the nuclear area with a special focus on nuclear safety culture and radioactive waste management. It will contribute to the creation and transfer not only of knowledge but also of skills and competences in a well-focused and practical manner. In the long term, it will contribute to improving the safety and radiation protection culture and hence, the safety of nuclear installations in the EU.
Type of action: Coordination and Support Actions.

The security of supply of nuclear fuel for research reactors (RR) is a key element in the availability of such reactors in the EU, which are essential for, notably, materials research, isotope production, silicon doping, nuclear science and engineering and related education and training purposes. It is thus imperative to recognise the needs and devise an appropriate European response in this area.
Scope:
This action should involve a multidisciplinary research consortium able to tackle technical as well as economical and legal aspects, and should include EU-based RR fuel manufacturers alongside a fully representative number of EU RR operators. It will investigate future needs in terms of volume and fuel design requirements for each reactor for which European operators do not possess relevant data, as well as the safety-related technical requirements of RR fuel manufacturing, storage, transport, and reprocessing, and can include possible pilot scale experiments. It will also have to address the regulatory context and the legal and economic conditions for the long-term sustainability of EU-based RR fuel manufacturing and long-term supply of LEU (low-enriched uranium).

Specific Challenge: Attempts were made to diversify the nuclear fuel supply for Russian pressurized water reactors (VVER). Although successful at some nuclear power plants operated in the EU it was abandoned for different reasons. As many as 16 VVERs are operating in the EU (essentially in the new Member States) and another 15 in Ukraine where feedback is also available on the potential safety issues. The diversification of fuel supply in EU VVER plants would be relevant for greater security of energy supply. However, the licensing in the EU of VVER reactor fuel assemblies manufactured by a new supplier requires a full range of safety evaluations for which R&D is to be carried out at EU level, involving industrial and regulatory (or TSO) experts.

It should aim at establishing all necessary safety analyses, tests and procedures in view of the further licensing of VVER fuel manufactured by Western suppliers, with due consideration to international safety standards. This would involve the assessment of accident safety cases produced by operators and their evaluation by regulatory authorities with the help of their TSOs. A strong cooperation between countries with experience in such adaptation of fuel type and other countries concerned shall be established. This cooperation initiative should allow reinforcing as quickly as possible the European capabilities in this domain. This activity to be fully relevant should consider different Western fuel sources.
Expected Impact: This action contributes to the security of supply of nuclear fuel for VVER reactors operating in the EU by supporting the diversification of fuel sources in the short / medium term in full compliance with nuclear safety standards.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The first Generation-IV reactors are expected to be fully operational in the next 25-30 years in various places around the world. In the meantime, all Generation-IV concepts and designs currently under development, both in Europe and worldwide, will need to demonstrate compliance with evolving and ever more stringent safety requirements. In this context, a significant increase in the level of safety is expected to be demonstrated by fast neutron reactors and new reactor coolants. These should exhibit more favourable behaviour in the case of severe accidents, whilst also offering major advantages in terms of the use of the uranium resource, reduction of high-level waste production and potentially increased proliferation resistance. This activity will build on the strong operational experience gained in the EU on fast neutron reactors, whilst ensuring that research and technical expertise on nuclear safety of Generation-IV reactor is shared effectively at EU level. The challenge is also to ensure that all European stakeholders, including civil society, can be represented in the assessment of the status of current developments concerning Generation-IV R&D with respect to expected safety features.
Scope:
This action is aimed at development of the technical assessment of safety improvements of critical fast neutron Generation-IV systems and their supporting reactor islands, as identified by ESNII in the SET Plan Integrated Roadmap[1]. This can include inter alia the study of core parameter optimisation and reactivity control, reliability of automatic shut-down systems, diversified systems of residual power removal more resistant to common mode failure, demonstrable natural circulation of cooling fluids in ultimate heat transfer processes, improved strategy of confinement modes and severe accident behaviour and mitigation including their simulation, in-service inspection and repair of safety-related components, as well as the related licensing aspects. The safety of different fuel cycle options is within scope, including dense MOX driver fuel, multiple recycling of plutonium, use of low-enriched uranium and transmutation of some minor actinides, as is the design and operational features facilitating and improving safety of decommissioning. These safety improvements will need to be endorsed by the EU scientific community in view of building up the main corpus of EU technical standards for Generation-IV to be used as the reference to demonstrate compliance with the amended Euratom Safety Directive. The proposed action should involve standardisation bodies at national and EU levels.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for topics NFRP 1 to 5 will be ranked in a single ranking list.
Expected Impact:
This action is to draw on the unique expertise and operational experience feedback gained by the EU in Generation-IV technology in order to place the EU at the forefront of the development of safety standards for this new generation of reactors, thereby helping EU safety standards to be adopted worldwide. This will ensure deployment of this next generation of reactors in conformity with the recognised stringent European safety standards whilst also boosting EU technological and industrial competitiveness.

EU nuclear plants need to demonstrate compliance with evolving and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, lessons learned from past accidents should be used to update existing accident management strategies. Therefore, the capability of current simulation tools to correctly cover all segments of the safety assessment methods and accident phenomenology should be verified and validated. This action should support further integration of the EU research community in providing reliable calculation results.
Scope:
Update and development of simulation tools and their experimental validation to improve safety features (including the performance and reliability of passive systems) and accident management strategies for GEN II, GEN III and GEN III+ reactors. The action should address technology gaps and focus on issues still not yet completely covered by past design-basis and severe accident research for GEN II, GEN III and GEN III+. Further, source term re-assessments should be done with a particular emphasis on innovative accident management strategies aiming at assessing human reliability issues and at guarantying a core heat-sink for all kind of accident sequences. The results should be reflected in the severe accident management guidelines (SAMG) and recommendations should be formulated to improve measures for emergency preparedness and response in order to reduce the burden of the emergency plans and possibly reduce the impact of evacuation plans.
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and trainees supported through the action.

Euratom has been active in the field of nuclear safety for over 50 years. The commitment of Euratom and its Member States to a high level of nuclear safety is reflected in the existing Euratom legislative framework as well as in the relevant Council Resolutions and the Conclusions of the European Council.
Since the dawn of nuclear energy in Europe, extensive in-depth research and development programmes have been implemented in EU Member States and at the Euratom level with the aim to assure the highest levels of the nuclear safety standards in Europe, targeting safety of the nuclear installations, radiation protection of EU population and societally responsible treatment of the nuclear waste produced in the EU countries.
In practice, the highest safety standards in the nuclear domain can be attained by the continuous process of industrial innovation in the fields of nuclear safety, radioactive waste management, decommissioning, radiation protection and non-power applications of nuclear and radiation technology.
Scope:
The aim of this action is to support technology transfer from the research community to industry, exploiting innovative aspects of previous research funded by the Euratom Programme in the area of safety of nuclear installations, decommissioning, radiation protection and radioactive waste management. This action should focus on closer-to-the-market activities including prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting and scaling-up for new or improved products, processes or services. Projects may include limited research and development activities. Projects submitted under this topic should clearly demonstrate European added value. Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme of between EUR 2.25 and up to a maximum of EUR 4.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Open access to data produced by projects funded by the Horizon 2020 is a growing priority and in the near future will become a requirement for all Horizon 2020-supported grants, including also the Euratom Programme. In the area of fusion, research data generated either by experimental devices or through computer simulations are fundamental and form the basis for the majority of scientific advances and publications in the domain. However, providing easy and transparent access to data, especially from the many different experimental devices, is a challenge, even for a very technically-minded research community such as in fusion. In order to provide the standardised access methods needed to ensure ease of use and interoperability of data, significant resources are required in terms of planning and development of suitable platforms and tools. The specific challenge to be addressed by this action is therefore to: (i) identify the data that would bring the most added value from greater accessibility and openness; and (ii) development of the support tools and platforms required to provide easy and standardised access to the identified data.
Scope:
The scope covers the comprehensive assessment of open data requirements and issues within the fusion programme, the recommendation of the best technical approaches for providing easy access to data, and the development of support platforms and tools required to implement an open data policy adapted to the needs of the fusion research programme. This could be achieved by pooling the talent and knowledge from other big science programmes and organisations, such as those participating in the EIROforum. The duration of the action will be for 2 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom Programme of between EUR 1 and up to a maximum of and EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed adequately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The successful conclusion of this action would, in addition to developing the tools and platforms needed for an open data approach, raise the profile and awareness of open data within the fusion programme. It would also lay the foundations for implementing an open data policy that is well adapted to the needs of the present and especially the future fusion energy research programme, particularly in the run up to the operation of ITER from the middle of the next decade.

The first deployable Generation-IV (GEN IV) reactors are expected to be operational in less than 30 years' time and in the meantime, GEN IV concepts and designs currently under development will need to demonstrate compliance with more stringent safety requirements. In this context, a significant increase in the safety levels compared to current technologies is expected to be demonstrated. Gen IV should exhibit more controlled behaviour in the case of severe accidents. The challenge is to develop new assessment and simulation tools for GEN IV with respect to expected safety features.
Scope:
The development and validation of new simulation tools should be performed for GEN IV reactors, aimed at the prevention of severe accidents. The action can cover concepts for barriers to accidents and their modelling for example GEN IV coolants, liquid fuels, fissile and fertile mixtures, fuel for transmutation, innovative automatic control and passive systems, etc. Proposed models for safety demonstrations as well as quantitative risks' estimate should be evaluated and will encompass experiments as well as numerical simulations. Therefore, this action will include the generation of data from experiments aimed at the validation of simulation tools. This activity will also ensure that research and technical expertise on GEN IV reactors' safety is shared effectively at EU level.
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and trainees supported through the action.

Expected Impact:
This action is expected to bring new simulation models and tools to the research community, able to support GEN IV reactors safety assessment in the next decades. These simulation codes, validated on the basis of GEN IV-focussed experimental data and determination of risks will lead to increased safety margins for this generation's designs and concepts. Development in GEN IV fission technology must be driven by key safety goals to meet EU nuclear safety standards. It is also expected that progress achieved in GEN IV models could contribute to safety improvements in other nuclear energy systems and components and have an impact on public understanding whilst also boosting the EU technological progress.

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are considered as an interesting option for electricity production, offering a compact size allowing for in-factory assembly and transport on-site and export potential. They are expected to be easier to build and to operate under certain site conditions. The smaller size of the reactor also offers interesting safety features, notably in terms of residual heat removal and size of containment structure. Compliance with the safety objective as established by Article 8a of Directive 2009/71/Euratom may significantly vary depending on the safety options of the proposed design and need to be further investigated. Light Water SMRs are expected to undergo safety demonstrations during next 10 to 15 years in compliance with Article 8a of that Directive.
Scope:
This action should investigate improved safety features of Light Water SMRs and provide a set of fundamental technical specifications, against which compliance of SMRs with Directive 2009/71/Euratom could be tested by safety regulators. The research should also propose the methodology for the performance of these tests, including the experimental validation of essential items of the proposed models of safety demonstration as well as their effects on the SMR licensing process under various typical fields of application. Due account should be taken of safety features for the refuelling and spent fuel management of SMRs in the above safety demonstration as well as to decommissioning. To increase the impact of the action, particular attention should be paid to Light Water SMR concepts deployable in the short-term.

This action is expected to allow the EU, within the next decade, to establish a baseline for testing of compliance of Light Water SMR concepts with the requirements of Directive 2009/71/Euratom. The methodology developed by this action and the following safety demonstration might also establish a baseline for SMR's licensing process, and thus lead to licensed and operating Light Water SMR demonstrators in the next 10 to 15 years. Moreover, it will pave the way for robust science-based recommendations to decision makers regarding nuclear safety of Light Water SMRs at EU level. In the longer term, it will reinforce the EU’s commercial prospects and competitiveness in this field.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The decommissioning of a power reactor is commonly scheduled to be completed over a very long period of several decades after it ceases of operation. This practice no longer responds to the early decommissioning demand shaped by the upcoming phase-out of nuclear power in certain Member States (MSs), the public interest, as well as the contemporary principles of environmental sustainability. By November 2018, only a few of the nuclear power reactors permanently shut down (169 worldwide of which 94 in the EU)[1] had been fully decommissioned. Based on the information provided by MSs[2], EU nuclear operators estimated that more than EUR 120 billion will be needed for nuclear decommissioning over the next 30 years. Hence, there is a powerful economic incentive to fund development and uptake of more efficient industrial applicable technologies. Moreover, the decommissioning of nuclear research facilities and nuclear fuel cycle facilities will need the development of innovative technologies.
The nuclear industry has not adequately exploited or implemented current technological capabilities, certain hands-on human activities within harsh radiation environments remains to be replaced and outdated technology are often used while performing decommissioning projects. The roadmap for decommissioning research (drafted under Euratom NFRP-2018-6) is going to provide guidance on the mid-term steps needed for the development of relevant knowledge within the in-homogeneous European NPPs landscape. Need for improved and efficient decommissioning strategies and technologies is pressing and the challenge is to capitalize European experience, make more effort on innovation, get in front of technological developments and bring them to bear on decommissioning in particularly efficient manners.
Scope:
This action focuses on closer-to-the-market activities aiming to capitalise existing technologies for characterisation and risk assessment, dismantling, on-site waste management and environmental remediation in order to gain needed efficiencies in the decommissioning of nuclear power reactors, research reactors, facilities for mining and processing of radioactive ore and any other nuclear facility.
Decommissioning is largely executed manually thereby requiring extensive personnel protection measures, engineering controls and costly, inefficient and detailed work planning and monitoring to achieve the required high safety levels. The action could address such issues exploiting remotely operated technologies coupled with current technologies for measurements, material handling, tooling, etc. Modular, automated, remotely operated technologies which are broadly applicable could be assembled and field-tested at nuclear facilities. The action may also address liabilities related to highly irradiated or contaminated materials. Effort should respond to specific characteristics of decontamination, dismantling and environmental remediation projects, which are often unique and dominated by non-routine operations. Development of innovative solutions should take into account ongoing improvement in safety conditions, project management efficiency and the associated costs.
Projects submitted under this topic are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 (see General Annex F) and demonstrate European added-value.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 2.8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action is expected to stimulate innovation and promote a robust world-leading decommissioning sector based on EU safety culture and know-how, taking advantage of promising innovative technologies that could contribute to timely and cost-efficient decommissioning on the basis of ensuring safety as well as protecting the workers, the public and the environment.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, the challenges in the field of radioactive waste management (RWM) include:
To improve, innovate and develop science and technology for the pre-disposal management of radioactive waste streams and categories for which industrially mature processes currently do not exist or for existing processes which could benefit from improvement and innovation.
To advance in the integration of research and development between Member States’ national programmes for potential common use of radioactive waste pre-disposal solutions together with addressing the needs of all Member States, including those without nuclear energy, in line with requirements under Directive 2011/70/Euratom.
To develop and transfer knowledge and competences across Member States' programmes.
Scope:
The objective of this action is to reinforce implementation of the scope of activities of the Joint Programming initiative in the field of pre-disposal of radioactive waste. The aim is to cover the management of all radioactive waste categories and streams other than: spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to which means have been allocated as part of the Euratom Work Programme 2018, topic NFRP 2018-06. Any activity related to pre-treatment during dismantling operations of nuclear facilities is not included in the present topic. Processes or technologies for the treatment and conditioning of long-lived intermediate level waste from reprocessing activities could be included if the process or technology to be developed can be used for other waste and their inclusion result from prioritisation between MSs' programmes.
Actions should primarily aim at developing methods, processes, technologies and demonstrators for the treatment and conditioning of wastes for which no or inadequate solutions are currently available and/or when improvement and innovation to existing ones would bring measurable benefits to several Member States (MSs). Priority should be given to activities aiming at starting common related developments at pan-European level leading to potential future use across a number of MSs. In addition to RD&D, work may include analyses of criteria and parameters and specifications for packages guiding decision-making on the added-value of developing treatment and conditioning technologies and their impact on the design, safety and economics of waste management and disposal. One or several separate activities may be proposed addressing one or more new or existing developments.
The grant(s) under this action will be complementary to the EJP co-fund action under the Euratom Work Programme 2018 – NFRP-6 – European Joint Research Programme in the management and disposal of radioactive waste. The reference founding documents of the EJP[1] (vision, SRA, roadmap and governance and implementation mechanisms) are expected to be updated and adapted jointly with the programme executive body of the EJP to align and share the approaches between the different communities.
Knowledge management activities are expected to be organised to develop and transfer knowledge and competence across MSs' national programmes. These would primarily take the form of training courses and mobility training schemes.
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and trainees supported through the action. (see Conditions for the Call- Eligibility and admissibility conditions).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 14.0 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In line with the objectives of Directive 2011/70/Euratom, this action should lead within the next decade and across Europe to the availability of treatment and conditioning technologies for radioactive waste streams and categories (other than spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste) arising in all MSs and for which industrially mature processes currently do not exist or improvement and innovation to existing ones with clear impact on waste management and disposal.
Implementation of the action should result in greater cross-fertilisation and interaction between national programmes in this area, the joint development of knowledge and competence and transfer between actors and could eventually lead to the common use of radioactive waste pre-disposal solutions.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
One of the main concerns in nuclear sector is a loss of the younger generation's interest for specialized nuclear knowledge and a risk that the current workforce, progressively retiring, couldn't be replaced. Highly educated personnel with very specific knowledge, skills and competences will be still required regardless of the development of nuclear power sector in the EU, as either new builds, development of innovative and advanced reactors, long-term operations, shut-down, decommissioning, waste management and radiation protection all necessitate qualified staff. This is also the case of other industrial and medical applications making use of ionising radiation. If the EU is to keep its global position and wants to stay in the forefront of mastering the nuclear technology, then a new generation of the qualified researchers and workforce needs to be secured.
Scope:
The aim is to bring innovation to nuclear education by employing and/or developing new methods and tools based on most recent pedagogical knowledge, including hands-on exercises in order to make the field more attractive for a younger generation. Whenever appropriate, possible career paths should be put into the perspective, by anticipating professions of tomorrow. Rather than developing new programmes and/or courses, the existing ones should be adapted. The action could target students as well as teachers for secondary, higher and vocational education. It should bring together specialists in technical teaching from both the field of nuclear technology and ionising radiation (including radiation protection) and it should implement the most advanced educational techniques. Involvement of end-users of nuclear technology (industry, operators, research centres, medical applications, remote handling technologies etc.) is also required.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action should contribute to increase the number of students and trainees and bring advanced educational technics in the field of nuclear technology and ionising radiation (including radiation protection) over next 3-5 years."

","Research and Innovation action
","15 May 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Protecting people and the environment from the potentially harmful effects of ionising radiation remains a challenge in the context of expanding practices involving radiation in the EU, notably in the medical sector. It is also important for the harmonisation of EU planning of response to a potential radioactive contamination of territories, taking into account post-accident and existing situations of naturally occurring radioactive material. It remains important for the management of radioactive waste, for the safe implementation of nuclear installations’ decommissioning. Scientific knowledge on which norms are based and adopted is progressing through the accumulation of knowledge on the effects of low-dose ionising radiation on peoples’ health and the environment. Complexity of data handling, interpretation and exploitation requires a multidisciplinary approach of the field that includes radiobiology, dosimetry in specific fields, epidemiology, radioecology, radiation-based imaging and therapeutic techniques, emergency preparedness and human science and society.
Scope:
This action should dwell on scientific outputs from past programmes in this field and add specific knowledge in areas of most promising research outcome or most significant contribution to peoples’ health and environment protection and should consider the priorities as identified by the European Radiation Protection Platforms (MELODI, EURADOS, NERIS, ALLIANCE, EURAMED). The proposal should focus on lifting key uncertainties about the risks from low-dose radiation and resolving challenges these uncertainties pose for the implementation of Directive Euratom 2013/59. In particular, it should address people’s exposures to radon in terms of risk assessment and mitigation. The proposal should also investigate innovative concepts to explain the varied responses of biological and ecological systems, due to their own diversity, to the diverse pathways by which radiation release energy to bio-molecules, cells and organ tissues and propose innovative ways to incorporate existing concepts into risk prevention, assessment and management, including stakeholder’s involvement processes. The proposal should include shared experimental work between the European research infrastructures in radiation protection identified in previous programmes. It should also include the exchange of scientists in order to cross-fertilise teams and mutualise the best use of infrastructures. The benefit of the proposal for preservation of the integrative process of research teams having a regulatory mandate for radiation protection research and teams able to contribute to knowledge by their proximity with the wider research community will also be considered during evaluation.
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and trainees supported through the action (see Conditions for the Call- Eligibility and admissibility conditions).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 18.0 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action will lead to the provision of more consolidated and robust science-based policy recommendations to decision makers in the area of radiation protection. This will be achieved by further integrating the radiation protection scientific community at EU level, leading to a better coordination of research efforts. In the long term, this knowledge will translate into additional or improved practical measures in view of the effective radiation protection of people and the environment."

","Coordination and support action
","15 May 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Nuclear and ionising radiation technologies have a central place in modern medicine, saving lives and improving the quality of life for patients. In the EU alone, each citizen will undergo on average at least one medical procedure involving ionising radiation each year. This includes a wide variety of diagnostic tests – from simple dental or chest x-rays, through mass screening for female breast cancer, to molecular and advanced imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) or hybrid imaging. Radiological imaging is also an integral component of minimally invasive interventional procedures, for example in cardiology and vascular treatments. Radiotherapy is an indispensable tool in the fight against cancer used in about half of the cancer patients in Europe.
The medical applications of ionising radiation have also significant growth and jobs potential. The EUR 20 billion global market of medical radiological equipment has an annual growth of at least 3%. In Europe alone, more than 700,000 healthcare workers are involved in medical procedures using ionising radiation. At least 60,000 people are directly employed by the medical equipment manufacturers which includes EU-based industrial champions and also many SMEs.
The medical applications of ionising radiation experience rapid development, both on the diagnostic and therapeutic side. Modern imaging and therapy are constantly progressing and technologies become more complex. There is a trend towards integrating different imaging modalities, diagnosis and treatment and move towards precision and personalised medicine.
This dynamic environment calls for the development of a co-ordinated and systematic European approach to research and innovation in medical applications of ionising radiation, with the aim to improve patient care and quality of life of the EU citizens, support growth and jobs in the EU and to improve the EU’s position on the global market. The action in this area should be informed by, and co-ordinated with, other Commission work on non-power applications of ionising radiation[1].
Scope:
This action should prepare a Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) for research on medical applications of ionising radiation during with the objective of ensuring synergies between the 'Health' cluster of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025[2]. Inputs and active involvement of European stakeholders from the clinical, industrial, regulatory, scientific and all other relevant fields should be ensured through their inclusion in the project consortium, by organising dedicated events, workshops and by any other relevant ways of involvement.
Building upon the preparatory activities towards a Strategic agenda for non-power applications [https://ec.europa.eu/info/events/addressing-societal-challenges-through-advancing-medical-industrial-and-research-applications-nuclear-and-radiation-technology-2018-mar-20_en , this action should:
Analyse the research needs for the development and delivery of high-quality healthcare for the European citizens including, but not limited to, the long-term supply of radioisotopes, quality and safety of medical applications of ionising radiation and facilitating innovation in medical therapies and imaging involving ionising radiation.
Identify the key needs and actions for European research into the medical applications of ionising radiation including diagnostic and therapeutic applications of x-rays, particle accelerators, radioisotopes and research reactors.
Identify the needs for European research to support innovation in further medical applications, such as photon, proton and heavy ion radiotherapy, molecular radiotherapy and theranostics, image guided radiotherapy, advanced and hybrid diagnostic imaging, health screening etc.
The SRA section on medical radioisotopes should examine the possibility (including advantages and drawbacks) for establishing a European centre of excellence for research into new or improved radioisotope therapies and diagnostic tests as well as into new or improved methods for production of radioisotopes. Other areas of research, e.g. relating to the security of supply of radioisotopes, may also be covered.
Identify needs and actions, strengths and weaknesses of European research actors in respect to the various aforementioned fields.
Analyse and propose actions, if needed, regarding the EU education and training capabilities and future needs related to the various aforementioned fields.
Propose a way forward towards integrating radiation protection and safety aspects of medical applications into a broader framework of quality and safety in healthcare. Aspects relating to clinical research, equipment and drugs authorisation, development and implementation of clinical guidance, equipment quality control and dose measurement, use of e-Health systems, etc. should be examined.
The SRA should also consider improvements to protection of staff, patients, carers, the public and the environment in medical installations against adverse effects of radiation. In this context, the SRA should take account of the existing research agendas[3] and Euratom actions[4] on radiation protection in medicine, as well as the principles of radiation protection defined by Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 2.0 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The SRA for research into the medical applications of ionising radiation will provide guidance to stakeholders and the Commission on the steps needed in the coming decades for the development of research activities and knowledge in this area.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU remains the major world operator of research reactors and supplier of medical radioisotopes. Low enriched uranium is key to ensure the secure supply of research reactors’ fuel and targets in compliance with the Euratom’s international commitments on non-proliferation. Previous Euratom work programmes (WP2014-2015 and WP2016-2017) already supported research on the safety of low enriched and high-density fuel for research reactors in order to improve understanding of the fuels’ irradiation behaviour and optimise the manufacturing process and modelling. However, much remains to be done in this field, in particular in terms of fuel qualification, considering the requirements of the entire supply, operation and decommissioning chain.
Scope:
This action should involve a multidisciplinary research consortium able to tackle technical aspects of production of fuel for research reactors. It should include EU-based research reactors fuel alongside EU research reactor operators. It should focus on increased safety and, in this context on the qualification phase of fuel elements based on low-enriched uranium. It should further investigate future needs in terms of volume and fuel design requirements in line with relevant data for each EU research reactor type. The action should also prepare technical requirements for the safety of manufacturing, storage, transport and reprocessing of such research reactor fuel. It may include pilot scale experiments. It should take into account the regulatory, legal and economic contexts to propose a sustainable chain of EU-based research reactors’ fuel manufacturing. All actions should be undertaken considering the activities of the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) in this area [1].
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and trainees supported through the action (see Conditions for the Call- Eligibility and admissibility conditions).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 7.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action will sustain the EU’s capacity in the production of medical radioisotopes by ensuring the availability of high-performance research reactors. It will thus contribute to health care through provision of innovative medical radioisotopes necessary for diagnostic and therapy. It will further support European industry by giving access to research reactor irradiation capabilities.

","15 May 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The Jules Horowitz Reactor (JHR) is a new Material Testing Reactor to be used for scientific studies dealing with materials and nuclear fuels behaviour under high neutron flux, which should help to enhance safety of existing and future nuclear installations. JHR is in the advanced construction phase and it is expected that the first irradiation campaign in the reactor would start in the first half of the 2020 decade. It is expected that JHR will operate for at least 30 years.
JHR is an international endeavour, with the strong European basis. France is the main contributor in the JHR Consortium [1], and with several other European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Spain, Sweden, UK) plus Israel and India, they form a consortium able to build and to operate this research reactor according to the highest safety standards. Three service contracts have been signed by Euratom with the JHR operator. These service contracts together provide for the acquisition of 5.15% of the access rights of the total irradiation capacity of JHR to be used in the indirect actions (4.15%[2]) and direct actions (1.0%) of the Euratom research and training programmes.
A 4-year periodic planning, with mid-term revision, is foreseen for the irradiation campaigns. Members of the JHR Consortium already started an analysis of their irradiation needs for the 1st 4-year irradiation plan. An action is therefore necessary to support creation of the Roadmap for use of Euratom access rights to JHR experimental capacity by the European nuclear materials and fuels research community.
Scope:
This action should lead to the creation of the Roadmap covering at least 15 years from the start of the 1st irradiation campaign at JHR, with a goal to assure proper and effective use of the Euratom access rights by research consortia funded through Euratom indirect actions. This Roadmap should include more detailed irradiation plan for the 1st 4-years period of JHR operation. The Roadmap is supposed to take into account availability of the specific experimental rigs at different stages of JHR operation. The Roadmap should comprise an analysis of the financial model to be used for funding irradiation experiments. It is expected that the strategic research documents of the relevant European groupings (e.g. NUGENIA, EERA Joint Programme on Nuclear Materials[3] [4] [5]) are taken into account for the Roadmap creation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 1.1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The JRC is expected to participate in this action to ensure that it covers the full use of the Euratom access right while taking into account the JRC planned activities. In such participation JRC staff and operational costs will be covered by JRC budget as appropriate.
Expected Impact:
This action should bring together all key actors involved in JHR and define the strategic roadmap for at least 15 years. This will facilitate planning of the JHR irradiation campaigns while ensuring optimal use of the Euratom access rights to the JHR experimental capacity.
[1]EURATOM, represented by the European Commission, has an observer status at JHR Consortium.

It would also support the planning and eventual refurbishment of existing research reactors or construction of new ones such as JHR, MYRRHA and PALLAS.
Scope:
This action will network the largest possible number of research reactor operators at European level in order to facilitate the exchange of information on the availability of research reactors against research and radioisotopes production needs across Europe. It will also identify the key parameters that are influencing reactor availability and derive an overall strategy for future exploitation of research reactors in Europe. This should be undertaken in collaboration with existing initiatives in this domain and taking into consideration the issue of supply of radioisotopes.

Nowadays medical care extensively uses ionising radiation for diagnostic and therapy. Together with natural radiation, medical applications are the main contributor to the exposure of the European population to ionising radiation. The use of appropriate radioisotopes in nuclear medicine in diagnostic and therapy (theranostics) is progressing. The reinforced risk appraisal of medical exposure will reinforce consideration of benefits. It includes the selection of appropriate radioactive cytostatic compounds and the establishment of adequate controls of their discharges in water streams by selecting short-lived radioisotopes that take into account the protection of workers, carers and comforters, the public and the environment. These progresses will be faster if more certainty about overall detriment is available. Moreover, the medical sector is the best place to keep record of the overall health condition of patients. Thus, using data of patients in the medical sector together with radiation exposure records will improve knowledge. Previous funding efforts have launched collaboration between radiological protection specialists and medical doctors. It deserves further collaboration as results can be used for other exposure situations.
Scope:
This action should add clarity on detriment from new medical applications of ionising radiation in view of their fast deployment. This should include harmonised patient data collection from different disciplines and treatment approaches in order to enable deduction of the mechanisms leading to health detriment and to enable improved treatment. This should apply due consideration to double causation and peculiar conditions to medical procedures. This action should take into account the gap analysis performed by MELODI, EURADOS and EURAMED, and address the key issue of individual sensitivity and susceptibility to radiation. The proposal should include methods for radiation detriment appraisal with demonstrable shift from the current metrics. It should take due account of previous research that is cross-cutting with health and radiological protection. This data should include data collected from imaging procedures benefiting to the most sensitive, extensive and long lasting followed-up category of patients. It should also include data on most exposed medical staff as well as patients of nuclear medicine, including theranostics. It should also provide recommendations on radiological protection for the development of new applications of radiation in medical care, per category and per procedure. It should involve radiology and therapy equipment manufacturers or their associations, European associations of researchers in this field, organisations having a regulatory mandate for radiation protection research from Member States or EU bodies and universities and hospitals. It should also involve radioisotope developers and suppliers. Proposals in this topic should take into consideration risk communication and the ethics of medical applications.
At least 5% of the total action budget must be dedicated to Education and Training activities for PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and trainees supported through the action (see Conditions for the Call- Eligibility and admissibility conditions).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Euratom Programme up to EUR 6.0 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
New applications of radiation in medical care will be able to use fast-track approval procedures thanks to the better appraisal of their possible health detriment. This action will improve risk assessment capabilities of the two main sources of radiation exposure of the European population through improved knowledge on internal exposure. In the long term, it will help controlling the discharge of cytostatic compounds in the environment."

The ambition of the European Union to achieve a secure, competitive and sustainable energy system by 2050 has become a priority. The electric power system will play a pivotal role in the overall energy mix, with particular challenges to achieve a balance between electricity supply, conversion, transport and use of energy. Critical raw materials[1] (CRM) can become a bottleneck to the supply-chain of the different technologies used in the electric power system with implications for materials demand under different scenarios described in the EU Energy Roadmap 2050.
Even if recycling rates for some of these materials could be optimised to the highest possible extent, the overall increasing demand for CRM urges the roll-out of substitution-based solutions within the next decade.
This specific challenge is covered by the Priority Area “Substitution of raw materials” of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.
Scope:
Proposals should deliver innovative, sustainable and cost effective materials solutions for the substitution of (i) heavy rare earth elements used in permanent magnets; and/or (ii) CRM used in energy storage applications; and/or (iii) CRM used in catalysts for applications to generate electricity; and/or (iv) CRM in materials used in photovoltaic cells. Substitution of CRM in electronics or lighting applications is excluded.
In order to ensure the industrial relevance and impact of the research efforts, the cost effectiveness and commercial exploitation potential of the proposed solutions compared to state-of-the-art solutions currently available on the market should be convincingly assessed in the proposal. The sustainability of the materials solutions should be analysed through a life-cycle assessment. Recycling/reuse should be addressed.
Where relevant, proposals should contribute to the ""Expert network on critical raw materials"". Refer to the part on 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' of this Work Programme, topic SC5-15a-2016.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 3 and target TRL 5.
In line with the objectives of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation according to the current rules of participation is encouraged, in particular with Japan[2]. The quality of the international cooperation will be reflected in the evaluation of the proposal, under the criteria 'Excellence' and 'Impact'.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
A strongly reduced or completely eliminated CRM content in the proposed solution(s) while keeping up or improving the materials performance levels as specified in the relevant parts of the SET-Plan Integrated Roadmap and its Annexes, available at https://setis.ec.europa.eu/set-plan-process/integrated-roadmap-and-action-plan

","04 May 2017","Specific Challenge:
The development of smart materials has been gathering pace over the past few years to develop novel concepts for intelligent components and structures with integrated functionalities that are able to communicate and interact with their environment, store data about their condition and react accordingly to external stimuli. Research in the areas of biomimetic bio-inspired engineering and nanomaterials can provide several examples of the development of smart materials and has seen a significant expansion. Examples include materials that can alter their physical properties, (e.g. viscosity, shape, colour and more) in response to temperature, stress, electrical or magnetic fields, convert sunlight into electricity, store energy, etc. Smart materials have also been used extensively in sensor developments in aerospace and automotive applications with the aim of producing intelligent structures and components that provide information of their in-service conditions However, there are several concepts that have not yet been implemented in industrial scale. Such technologies include self-repair or self-healing materials, materials for vibration suppression, lightweight composites that can inform the user of any internal damage without the need of time consuming and expensive Non-destructive Examination (NDE), materials or structures that can undergo shape change either passively or by activation, Functionally Graded composite Materials (FGMs), energy storing components, etc. There is a need for predictive modelling of materials functionalities for those materials for which there are currently no accurate commercial or open-source codes available.
Scope:
Proposals are sought to address specific industrial needs and facilitate the implementation of smart materials for applications in transport, consumer goods and ICT. The potential extension of these applications to other industrial sectors such as e.g. oil & gas and petrochemicals will be an asset. The technical challenges to be addressed relate to the development, processing and integration of smart materials with new functionalities, as e.g. for: advanced sensors (nanosensor technologies), damage detection, self-repair, self-actuation, self-sensing morphing, magnetic functionality (for non-magnetic materials), optical functionality, sound and vibration damping, thermal management in ICT applications. Material concepts based on bio-inspired solutions can also be considered. Modelling of the properties of relevance to manufacturing should be considered and further developed. Although the materials most suited to such development are lightweight advanced composites from different material classes, (like multiferroics, polymeric, ceramic, glass or metal matrix composites, organic fibrous materials). It is expected that such smart materials may make use of the unique properties possessed by nanoparticles and therefore the development of nanomaterial based intelligent components will be within the scope of the call. The development of such material structures has to be accompanied by high resolution analytical tools that are able to simulate and characterise the materials on all scales and, moreover, to track and reveal their function –structure relations in situ. The functionalities of smart materials will require the identification of gaps in standards and future pre-normative activities will have to be addressed as part of the scope. For this topic proposals should also be able to demonstrate in addition to the development concept, the feasibility of such technologies in terms of cost, production and processing methodologies, reuse/recycling of materials at end of life and reliability. Industrial and/or additional experimental partners should ensure broad validation and adoption of both the software and the materials.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 4 and target TRL 6.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The implementation of novel smart material technologies is expected to pave the way for innovative environmentally friendly smart products:
Enhancing the market opportunities for European industries;
Improving consumer safety;
Reducing maintenance costs;
Improving resource efficiency;
Contributing to a future circular economy;
Improved understanding of materials properties based on theoretical materials models.
Enhancing the knowledge base in the EU not only at the R&D level but also at the manufacturing and production level, creating a highly skilled workforce with improved levels of job satisfaction.

","15 October 2015
","24 May 2016","Specific Challenge:
In many currently explored applications of organic-inorganic hybrid materials, the achievement of superior properties is often hampered by the weak chemical (i.e. van der Waals, hydrogen bonding) interactions existing between the inorganic building blocks, leading, inter alia, to leaching of the inorganic components, agglomeration, phase separation, low mechanical stability. This is particularly critical for heterogeneous catalysis applications, where a robust linkage between the components would afford better performances in terms of recovery and re-use of the catalyst. A further factor affecting the actual effectiveness of heterogeneous catalysts is the accessibility of the active component, being facilitated by either i) a porous microstructure or by ii) a loosely cross-linked structure enabling swelling of the hybrid catalyst in the reaction medium, where the substrate is dispersed. In the latter case, an important role is played by the polarity of the medium in which the catalysis is carried out.
Scope:
Explore novel concepts in hybrid materials design for heterogeneous catalysis, e.g. based on templating-effects, hierarchical architectures, tailored heterostructures or surface functionalisation and based on one-step synthesis, accomplishing i) the formation of a robust structure based on covalent bonds between organic and inorganic components and ii) accessibility of the catalysis-active moiety by tailoring the morphology and the polarity of the resulting materials, according to the targeted conditions and application such as condensations and asymmetric reactions.
A further aspect to be taken into account is the possibility to tune the cross-linking degree of the obtained hybrid materials by changing the synthetic parameters and synthesis route, to achieve different nano- and microstructures. The novel routes should be based on easy synthetic step(s) being scalable and adjustable for industrial scale, where toxic properties and LCA are taken into consideration.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 3 and target TRL 5.
The European Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 to 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Scientific and technological breakthroughs in the development of novel concepts in hybrid materials design for industrial heterogeneous catalysis;
Proposals addressing novel C-C bond forming and recyclable hybrid catalysts are expected to produce valuable chemicals of biological and pharmaceutical importance;
The activity of the novel solid hybrid catalysts is expected be higher than the counterpart homogenous catalyst, improving process efficiency providing economic and environmental benefits;
Considering the leading-edge character of the proposed field, the impact for the European industry in terms of market entry of new and improved products based on project results is expected to be in the medium to long term (5 – 10 years after project end).

Complex multi-component, hybrid, functional nanomaterials and High Aspect Ratio Nanoparticles (NMs&HARNs), present both innovation potential and challenges in terms of assessing the risk in different environments. Concerns for these multi-component nanomaterials result from differing rates of degradation and toxicities of the separate and interacting components and their different interactions with biological and environmental systems. Previous projects on Safe by Design have developed risk assessment tools and strategies, however they were only implemented within the context of an example case study. The implementation of these tools and approach at scale is still remains to be achieved. The challenge is to develop and implement Safe by Design concepts for products incorporating such nanomaterials and to understand their impact on manufacturing processes, on product performance, and on the environment and on health.

The proposals should:
Coordinate with the projects from NMBP-15-2019, and focus on filling the gaps in the current understanding of exposure and hazard characteristics of NMs&HARNs especially those arising from their unique properties, as well as assessing the extent of and rates by which variations of environment modify the nanoparticle properties and agglomeration rates;
Use multiscale modelling approaches to identify how different patterns of release may influence physiological responses and how elements of multi-component nanomaterials interact with each other, with other NMs, and other chemicals leading ultimately to mixture toxicity;
Develop knowledge and tools for Safe by Design approaches that support the development of multi-component nano-enabled products with reduced persistence, exposure and hazard. This should be coupled with developing multi-scale modelling approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed safe-by-design strategies

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The rapid expansion of nanotechnology has brought the question of the safety of the emerging applications and the risk management measures. Considerable effort has been put by FP6 and FP7 projects for answering basis scientific and technical questions and will continue under H2020. There is a need to support regulatory aspects by providing the technology, skills and conventions necessary for implementation of existing rules and consistent development of new ones. This supposes developing the capacity to routinely assess and reduce risks in regulatory terms, both for toxicity and exposure, and the capacity to develop and implement safe-by-design processes and products with the aim of keeping risk level below pre-defined values.
Scope:
The objective of this topic is to support safe innovation related aspects by providing the technology, skills, and processes, necessary for science-based best NanoSafety practices in industrial and commercial activities.
This objective is being addressed by nano-risk excellence centres currently being established in several EU member states and globally. A wide variety of national and (EU) regional platforms and centres can be observed which are dedicated to research, market follow-up, dissemination of nanosafety. There is the need to consolidate and further develop these first initiatives so as to make available to industry and other stakeholders concerned a European-wide, up-to-date, science-based, organisational structure capable of managing risks and supporting safe innovation. It should also ensure providing scientific support to more general questions on product quality, technical approvals, counterfeiting, training and certification system for nanosafety at work and providing reliable information for the public.
The proposed CSA should aim at networking these platforms, including the nanosafety cluster, at European level and cooperate with third countries. The foundation and basis for the development of the European nano-network will be based on the interaction and adequate communication to generate a step-change in the risk management process. It may include work and resources specific to the participants or other public and private sources. The CSA can be used to pool resources and organise calls for market oriented activities which are of common interest for the platforms.
To ensure fast transfer of knowledge from basic research to market implementation, the proposed CSA should strengthen and support the Nanosafety Cluster activities, in particular those aiming at communication and outreach.
In line with the objectives of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012) 497), international cooperation according to the current rules of participation is encouraged, in particular with Brazil, South Korea and the United States of America. The quality of the international cooperation will be reflected in the evaluation of the proposal, under the criteria 'Excellence' and 'Impact'.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
An independent science based EU nanosafety reference platform for all stakeholders in nanotechnology that collates information into a comprehensive and accessible European network portal and providing a solution to the problem of data accessibility and transferability, by removing barriers which currently limit knowledge distribution;
The CSA should mark progress for Guidance to market actors (industry, safety service providers, and public authorities), best practice, standards, technical approvals, environment protection, and operational certification systems;
The platforms network should prepare a European Hub to provide services and support for stakeholders (e.g. industry, governments, researchers etc.) to create in a sustainable way marketable, societal approved products and goods;
Involvement of highly renowned actors in the research field and from leading stakeholders from regulatory bodies, standardization bodies, into a seedless dialogue;
Significant research outputs efficiently disseminated to national and international communities.

","04 May 2017","Specific Challenge:
The number of available nanomaterials is growing rapidly and testing each material thoroughly is virtually impossible. For convincingly managing eventual risk, precise quantification of hazards and exposure would be necessary for all cases and engineering-out or reducing risk must follow in cases of non-acceptable risks. All engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) would need characterising along all value chains and all used media and physiological chemistries. It is therefore essential to set the basis for an appropriate and sustainable framework and define strategies towards ENMs classification, grouping (categorisation for further purposes) and read-across for risk analysis in a regulatory perspective.
Scope:
The existing and rapidly progressing knowledge in this domain, in terms of characterisation of material properties and of possible adverse effects from their applications, is expected to allow for classification of ENMs based on morphology, composition, complexity/functionality, and by bio or eco-interactions. The classification approaches should aim to support grouping of ENMs for further risk analysis, to help in developing intelligent testing strategies and identifying ""ENMs properties of concern"" that need to be tested more thoroughly. Methods for grouping and for read-across within or between groups, should be defined to reduce unnecessary efforts in testing. Grouping can take into account quantification of possible adverse effects depending on the use on ENMs in specific applications. Results from these studies should be collected and combined in a consistent and progressive system enabling both the integration of newer data and the use of raw and aggregated data for regulatory purposes. Particular attention should be paid to supporting safer-by-design practices, so that novel products containing ENMs provide the benefits originally claimed by maintaining fullest possible intended functionality and at the same time pose the least possibly risks to humans, the environment and ecosystem services. The proposed projects should include appropriate data curation expertise, modelling (including development of theoretical models if appropriate) and input into the possible development of Q(n)SP/AR approaches in order to develop user friendly interfaces to enable data driven predictions from other ENMs with similar properties or behaviour, and predictive risk assessment tools.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7
This topic is particularly suitable for international cooperation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected Impact:
The research approach should be innovative and represent a significant advance beyond the current state-of-the-art in the whole area of nanomaterials hazard and exposure assessment;
Sustainable solutions to the long-term challenge of nanosafety at a level that will allow both consistent integration of newer data and regulatory application of scientifically sound concepts;
Cutting-edge progress towards a framework and methods for groupings and read-across useable in a regulatory environment;
Demonstration of consistent, applicable and scientifically sound grouping and read-across strategies in specific value chains, ready for use by industry and regulators, enabling predictive hazard and exposure modelling for risk analysis, and including the input towards safer-by-design guidance;

Sustaining and growing businesses requires continuous product innovation. Making meaningful business strategy decisions is an ever more challenging task in a global context. The combination of materials and business modelling to explore what technical solutions are economically viable is not yet exploited to the extend it could. The sheer volume of data and information combined with its dynamic nature demands an ever better understanding of possible options. There is a need for a Business Decision Support System that supports the selection of the optimal material and process taking into account the implementation costs but also the associated risks, uncertainties and costs related to the modelling and simulation; a priority, especially for SMEs.
Scope:
The proposals should develop an integrated Business Decision Support System (BDSS) that can support decisions on new materials and new processes by calculating through hypothetical scenarios.
The BDSS should enable the integration of materials modelling and business tools and databases into a single work-flow, allowing for flexibility of application to different industrial sectors.
Proposals should create a framework that allows the flexible integration of existing or future discrete and continuum materials models with structured and unstructured data from multiple data bases containing materials data, commercial data and information on market trends, pricing, customer needs and demands.
The BDSS should enable a multi-criteria optimisation over all stages of product development by allowing the end-user to mirror the operational framework of their company. The structure of the BDSS should allow back-engineering from the end-goal. BDSS should be designed such as to optimise the integration of humans in new more complex industrial environments. The tool should be available to and usable by decision makers in manufacturing companies in the form of a platform which can be confidentially applied by a company.The tool should be validated against measurements, existing data and real financial arguments. Validation of the developed systems on public case studies and training of translators on the system is required.
Development of innovative methodologies should be included addressing innovative ways to connect existing and future models and how to use them in varying contexts (adaptive systems and networks). If appropriate, model development in terms of accuracy, robustness, uncertainty qualification and speed to allow a large design space to be explored may be included in order to enable exchange of modules and to prove flexibility of the framework. The consortium is expected to provide expertise on multiple discrete and continuum materials models[1], business decision support systems, data search technology (incl. optimalisation, genetic algorithms, symbolic regression, machine learning and cognitive learning).
Activities are expected to target Technology Readiness Level 5.
Funded proposals will be invited to participate in a cluster, to agree on standards to achieve seamless integration of their frameworks and of the modules to be linked into the framework. Projects are expected to contribute actively to on-going activities e.g. in the EMMC (European Materials Modelling Council), and EU funded clusters.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Reduction of company costs and increased performance and commercial impact based on effective materials models driven business decisions;
Guidance to companies in developing their strategies with an effective, user friendly materials models driven business decision system;
Increased industrial use of existing materials knowledge and effective materials models;
Improved trust of industrial decision makers in materials modelling and their commercial advantage;
Essential company savings in time and money, especially via the elimination of the need for (some) plant trials.

Predictive multi-scale material modelling has the potential to enable economic advantages for all manufacturing industries. There is a need for enhanced and effective interaction between all stakeholders, in particular between those engaged in different types of materials modelling (electronic, atomistic, mesoscopic and continuum materials, process and device modelling) and between translators, who translate industrial problems into materials modelling and manufacturers. In addition a lack has been identified for clear road maps for research on the application and use of materials modelling in industry. Moreover, there is a need to collate different methodologies and support further development of standards for efficient and effective implementation and use of materials modelling tools. Also there is a need to increase the interoperability of software to facilitate integration of various tools in processing and product design.
Scope:
The proposed coordination and support action should network the stakeholders and a platform is to be established to advance the use of materials models by industry and to agree on open tools with the wide stakeholder community.
Road Maps for materials and related product and process modelling in industry with a focus on how discrete (electronic, atomistic and mesoscopic) models can be further developed and coupled or linked to continuum models are to be elaborated. The proposers should support the elaboration of methodologies and workflows.
A materials modelling data repository of validated sources should be designed with coherent and concerted connections. Existing communication standards between models and databases should be further developed, alleviating the language gap between different vocabularies. An open simulation platform based on these standards should be designed to allow the flexible use of software components of different vendors. Provision of validated data by third parties should be stimulated.
Benchmarking of tools and experimental data should be supported.
A jointly agreed guidance on software development for academics is to be established and promoted so that such software can be used by industry. Technology Readiness Levels for software, which could help in selecting the right model/software for the end user, should be agreed with the wide community.
The translation of industrial problems into material problems that can be solved by computational simulation should be facilitated.
Training and dissemination should be stimulated across Europe to make the different stakeholders aware of the technical and economic benefits of active use of discrete and continuum materials modelling throughout company operations.
Networking activities such as developing interest groups, workshops, training events, market studies and engaging with regulatory and benchmarking authorities if appropriate can be included.

Nanomaterials are very diverse groups of materials with greatly varying properties. Thorough physico-chemical characterisation of nanomaterials, in their pristine forms but also in the tested environment, is nowadays being recognised as essential for sound assessment of their biological and environmental properties. In order to enable prediction of impacts, itself nowadays a pre-requirement for insuring industrial activity, a classification based on key parameters or biological interactions should be established and scientific foundations established on very well defined and characterised systems. Yet, suitable analytical techniques, instrumentation and equipment for the testing of nanomaterials properties, skilful operators, and inter-laboratory studies that would establish confidence are still lacking, even in the “simple”, and most addressed, case of particle size distribution measurements which many laboratories struggle to tackle adequately when confronted with poly-dispersed materials. At the lower limits of the nano-scale these same problems aggravate further. An additional factor is the high cost of the available techniques something that hinders smaller laboratories, innovation oriented SMEs, and discourages start-ups.
Scope:
The objective is to develop new, or further improve, relevant analytical methods and corresponding equipment, relevant to hazard and exposure testing strategies, that enable characterisation of ensembles of nanomaterials particle sizes, complex shapes, surface area and surface chemistry, coating stability or multiple composition (multicomposites engineered nanomaterials), including the necessary building up of confidence through benchmarking. The analytics could also enable studying the longer term fate of particles following their interactions with in complex matrices, i.e. in living systems, or longer term environmental fate, e.g. after wear and tear or weathering.
Established methods, including related equipment, should be brought to Technology Readiness Level 6 and beyond, whereas those based on new concepts are expected to reach TRL 5.

The current lack of stability in the markets does not create strong incentives for long-term investments in tangible fixed assets, and a quick response to market demand is crucial to market success. This calls for new business models to enable industry to adapt faster to market demand. At the same time, European industry needs to reap the full benefits of digitalisation, including a new generation of highly flexible production and process technologies and equipment, such as 3D-printing.
All European companies, especially SMEs, need to have access to technology infrastructure with appropriate manufacturing facilities to help them develop their innovative product-services from the early stage of feasibility assessment up to the fabrication of first series of prototype's products and purchasing is not always the best option.
It is also important to develop value systems that take into account the new extended supply chain from the early stage of the design process up to the end-of-life activities. In addition, the real production can nowadays take place anywhere in the world and leave Europe with unused or outdated production capacities. The current process does not take into account the economic, social and environmental benefits for Europe.
Scope:
Business models supporting the novel supply chains for innovative product-services would need to facilitate the flow of information on free utilisation capacity among service providers, which could be dedicated business set-ups for that kind of product-services, or just existing manufacturers with free production capacity at certain moments in time and business companies seeking short term solutions for their capacity shortages.
New equipment, internet, digital technologies and social media have the potential to support new supply chain models that are focused on business-to-business (B2B) as well as business-to-consumer (B2C) relationships, on improving the use of manufacturing capacity in Europe, e.g. by an innovative treatment of data flows on processes and products with the possible use of sectorial clouds.
Solutions should facilitate the flow of information on free manufacturing capacity among service providers (which could be dedicated businesses or existing manufacturers with spare capacity) as well as the flow and management of data in the context of the value chain.
The research activities should focus on all of the following areas:
New, adaptive business models, networks and configurations to optimise the integration of KETs in industrial contexts, in order to increase the leadership of EU industry in the global markets. The approaches to integrate KETs should lead to a new model for European industrial production and consumption, based on more sustainable and efficient production and consumption patterns, supporting increasingly customised sustainable products.
New business solutions for extended supply chains and the integrated sustainable European framework, which would take into account the needs of design, production, utilisation and end-of-life and overcome the risk of under-utilised capacity.
Solutions that would enable businesses in the supply chain to use new flexible production and processing systems tailored to their needs; to increase connectivity and inter-operability to rapidly coordinate; and to react to market demand as a whole system.
Solutions for local cooperation and supply, which can reduce the environmental footprint. These solutions should converge into high value-added production capable of responding dynamically to competing global economies demonstrating how the EU could benefit from international cooperation.
Project activities will focus on new concepts and methodologies for knowledge-based, specialised product-service, which can fulfil the requirements of fast changing markets for innovative product-services. The service could be supplemented by after-sale services and extended guarantees provided by any entity from the supply chain base on common agreement.
Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) elements should be considered, such as economics and business administration. In particular, proposals should address the role of consumers and users as active participants in the innovation process.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Innovative industrial business solutions taking full advantage of the potential provided by the digitisation of the European industry;
Decreased production costs in Europe, through a better use of the available manufacturing capacity;
Reduced environmental or carbon footprint compared to products produced in traditional value chains, by the use of local and regional product-services capacity;
Novel supply networks and solutions that could be applied across industries.

Innovation in manufacturing industries can be much faster, if materials modelling is used to focus experimental efforts. Novel modelling solutions need all determining components to be interwoven and available to the entire European community allowing the quick development and market deployment of new materials. Industry wants to know the risks and gains of materials modelling and the resources necessary to use the models efficiently. The industry needs education and/or support by translators analysing the industrial problems and proposing modelling solutions to the companies requesting this, supported by benchmarking. The above services need to be accompanied by tangible components like models, software packages, data, state of the art and connections to key actors. An open simulation platform providing interoperability between discrete and continuum models based on widely agreed communication standards would facilitate the use of materials modelling.
Scope:
The project should establish a web based marketplace linking various activities and databases on models, information on simulation tools, communities, expertise, course materials, lectures, seminars and tutorials for at least two manufacturing sectors of the European industry.
Projects should address sectors that in the design of materials and their manufacturing processes have common problems with models describing phenomena at, and ranging over, time and space scales spanning from femto-, pico-, nano- to the meso-scale.
The project should aim at agreement with the wide European scientific and industrial community a standard for organizing modeling data needed to make search and linking between different databases effective and easy. Strategies and test rules pertaining to data integrity and quality, e.g., by user and analytic feedback mechanisms should be established. The proposal should develop practical solutions for the ownership, control and management of distributed databases. The project should ensure wide spread participation.
The project should provide novel tangible avenues for integrating multiple materials models that can address industry relevant challenges. The project should establish methods for software interoperability that can later on be used for the integration of materials models (discrete and continuum applied at nanoscale) and databases in open simulation platforms. The development of homogenisation models and the elaboration of wrappers should be stimulated.
The proposal should establish a validation system to provide reliability and accuracy of models and for the comparison of results of simulations between materials models and for comparison with experiments.
The project should stimulate the exploitation of existing software via advice on modelling, education of companies and the stimulation of the provision of translation services especially for SMEs.
The proposal should present a credible business plan for the maintenance of the hub after the project duration.
Activities are expected to target Technology Readiness Level 6.
Funded proposals will be invited to participate in a cluster, to agree on metadata for the description of software and measurement tools and databases; to agree on software development standards; and to achieve seamless integration of their platforms across the different manufacturing-targeted application areas to achieve a true common marketplace. Projects are expected to contribute actively to on-going activities e.g. in the EMMC (European Materials Modelling Council), and EU funded clusters.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","14 May 2020","Specific Challenge:
The increasing interest in comparing and linking experimental data to achieve reliable end-user products necessitates the development of widely accepted standardised measurement methods as characterisation protocols for materials, processes and final product performance. To improve experimental data quality, reproducibility and traceability there is a need to develop, test, validate and agree on methodologies for measurement and characterisation techniques – such as microscopy, spectroscopy and diffraction techniques, as well as micro- and nano-mechanical tests – that are used in a wide variety of industries and settings through interoperable data exchange mechanisms. It is therefore critical that developers and users of current measurement and characterisation protocols reach a broad-ranging agreement on their standardisation, paving the way for new technologies in response to the emergent needs of Industry Commons.
Scope:
The proposals should develop EU-wide harmonised characterisation protocols and data exchange procedures that reduce measurement discrepancies and increase interoperability, feed into work done under Industry Commons and facilitate services within technology infrastructures. To maximise impact and synergies, projects should contribute to the objectives of the European Materials Characterisation Council (EMCC) and foresee the necessary resources to this effect. They should also collaborate with existing NMBP characterisation projects including the open innovation test beds for characterisation. Therefore, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package for this cooperation. In particular, the projects should:
Identify characterisation techniques and tools with wide applicability across NMBP domains;
Seek the involvement of standardisation bodies such as CEN-CENELEC and ISO;
Create operation protocols including sample preparation and harmonisation procedures;
Validate new methodologies and reference materials in different projects and/or testbeds across several domains;
Contribute to ontologies, standardised documentation and develop tools that can aid the traceability, integrity and interoperability of data for Industry Commons;
Develop working groups engaging stakeholders to accelerate the integration of materials characterisation and modelling from materials development to processing and manufacturing of products.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Validated and trusted characterisation protocols supporting modelling, lifecycle analysis and market harmonisation within the EU;
Facilitated comparability and traceability of characterisation data leading to increased trust in product quality and performance assessments;
Increased uptake of emerging characterisation innovations leading to developments of new standards and data exchange mechanisms and supporting the future needs of Industry Commons;
Accelerated characterisation of materials, and facilitation of simulation leading to a measurable reduction of costs for product design, time-to-market and regulatory compliance.

There is a general consensus that the implementation of nanotechnologies ought to be based on a clear science-based understanding of potential risks that might be associated to the manufacture, use and disposal of substances in the Nano form, as well as of products and articles containing nanomaterials. The scientific body of knowledge should be translated to a level of regulatory relevance, with support from regulatory research. A crucial element is the establishment, by consensus, of a set of scientifically reliable and regulatory relevant technical guidelines and good practices documents. Ideally such guidelines and documents should be aligned to the requirements for guidance and standards of international organisations such as OECD, ISO and CEN. Agreed standardised test guidelines and guidance documents are needed to allow reliable and relevant safety testing of nanomaterials regarding both human health and the environment. In particular, the OECD guidelines for chemicals' notification and registration under REACH need adaptation for nanomaterials from characterisation of materials and exposure, to potential for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Initial test guidelines and guidance documents are meant to be a basis that can be updated on a regular basis as well as expanded to keep pace with progress in science and regulatory needs and to ensure mutual acceptance of regulatory relevant data by the regulatory bodies of OECD member states.
Scope:
Outline specific research actions of regulatory research nature to cover existing gaps in OECD test guidelines and guidance documents development;
Establish integration of other public and private resources (funding or labour) to develop and validate new OECD test guidelines and OECD guidance documents;
Establish maximum synergy of actions across industrial sectors and international cooperation;
Support the completion of the elaborated documents by the relevant international organisations involving OECD Member States and relevant EU agencies;
Establish very close cooperation with Member States, OECD, BIAC, JRC, ECHA, EU and Member State agencies to act as leads and co-leads for the test guidelines and guidance documents to be developed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU around EUR 3 million would be an important contribution to allow this specific challenge to be further addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Filling the gaps that are currently blocking the way to international adoption of the running OECD projects with the aim to amend test guidelines and guidance documents for nanomaterials regarding both the environment and human health;
Delivery of a consistent, complete and timely set of standardized technical guidelines and guidance documents, internationally harmonised and validated respecting the principles of good laboratory practice, to effectively implement the existing chemicals' legal frameworks of OECD- and EU-Member States (i.e. REACH regulation in Europe) and to ensure safe manufacturing and responsible use of nanomaterials;
Establish seamless collaboration with the science layer (e.g. the EU Nano safety cluster), the relevant DGs and agencies of the EU, the OECD-WPMN, WNT, ISO and CEN.

The essential criteria for selecting projects under Horizon 2020 are excellence, impact and implementation. This requires attracting the best researchers and innovators in particular from the entire EU but also from countries associated to the programme. However, collaboration across borders and between industry and research organisations is still insufficiently developed. The challenge is therefore to ensure more cross border collaborative research involving participation from organisations, in particular Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), who have not yet participated in NMBP projects under Horizon 2020 to date (“newcomers”).
Scope:
Proposals should develop and work out a set of incentives to attract organisations, in particular SMEs and new users of technology from across the entire EU and countries associated to the programme. Proposals should develop and implement all of the following activities:
Identify researchers and innovators, considered as the best talents in the domains currently covered under NMBP, which have not been involved in NMBP Horizon 2020 projects so far; the identification should target in particular the best talents from regions so far underrepresented in Horizon 2020 projects;
Prepare an analysis of the most significant innovations from the domains covered by the NMBP programme whether resulting from an NMBP project or not; consider using the existing tools at EU level such as the Innovation Radar; identify hotspots where these innovations are regularly demonstrated;
Group the results of the analysis into clusters targeting newcomers and prepare the groupings with the support of current stakeholders, including those working in relevant contractual public-private partnerships;
Promote technology transfer activities and deployment of innovations based on the analysis and the developed clusters;
Encourage local innovation or technology transfer nodes to attract new actors, increase networking opportunities and deploy best practice for newcomers due to synergies with complementary initiatives and programmes at European and at national level, in close collaboration with national and regional support networks for H2020 and Horizon Europe.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU around EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Visibility of technology hotspots in the current NMBP domains across the entire EU;
Increase of newcomers’ rate in projects funded under relevant intervention areas in “Horizon Europe” to at least 50% compared to 39% in 2018 under the NMBP work programme. A significant part thereof should be SMEs prepared to invest in innovation.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal."

To optimally support pilot production, there is a need for a ""European Pilot Production Network"" (EPPN) that would act as a coordination platform in the area of nanotechnologies and advanced materials upscaling and pilot actions. EPPN would exploit synergies and maximise impact of the various investments, innovation programmes and financing from H2020, regional and private sources, ensuring cooperation with the Member States and Associated Countries and regions, as well as other stakeholders.
Scope:
This action should support the development and work of a EPPN with a clear added value to current H2020 pilot activities. The coordination action shall aim in particular to actively identify best practise on maximising the impact of new and existing pilot line activities in Europe. The initiative, which is expected to last 3 years, will require close collaboration with relevant regional and national public bodies, industrial associations, technology centres, private investors and organisations. Sustainability of the networking activity beyond the duration of EU funding support should be considered.
EPPN activities may include:
Mapping of EU, regional and national projects and pilot installations and their services, market opportunities and the potential users of these facilities.
Mapping of EU, regional and national opportunities for supporting access to pilot facilities by SMEs/Start-ups and upscaling of new businesses and identification of any barriers, such as training, safety, standards or regulatory.
Alignment with relevant EU, national, regional activities, such as National/Regional Access Programmes and EU Vanguard initiative including identification and adoption of best practise business models, IP management and marketing.
Cooperation with regional-national brokerage events bringing pilot facilities, local companies and capital providers together, including dedicated training workshops for potential new pilot facilities and their users (funding for event organisation is not envisaged in the current topic).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
The establishment and operation of the EPPN is expected to have impacts at three levels:
At Pilot line level:
Networking of individual pilot facilities to establish complete pilot ecosystems for key industrial value chains enabled by nanotechnologies and advanced materials; established and demonstrated examples of best practise business models, IPR management and marketing approaches.
At end-user level:
Promoting knowledge of EU, regional and national support opportunities, facilitating in particular SME access to pilot facilities. Successfully bringing pilot facilities, local companies and capital providers together, leading to the creation of new or scaling up of existing businesses.
At policy level:
Practical policy recommendations resulting from interactions with relevant regional and national public bodies, advancing the work of the NANOfutures Integrated Research and Innovation Roadmap (2013-2025) and the Multi-KETs Pilot Lines Final Report; Practical examples and recommendations directed to the relevant EU and National initiatives, for addressing horizontal barriers, in particular on funding and financing, but also including training, safety, standards, and regulatory issues.

Specific challenge: The field of nanocomposites materials has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years with many different types of nanocomposites exhibiting radically enhanced properties for a wide range of industrial applications. New manufacturing routes are also emerging, such as in-situ synthesis. The main objective is to develop cost effective and sustainable industrial scale technologies for the production of nanocomposites for specific applications, aiming at the selection, testing and optimisation of materials and process parameters as well as the verification of the nanocomposite performance for a given application in a pilot line setting, representative of operational industrial environments and ready for the start of pilot production as the next step (after the project).
In order to enable SMEs to enter this crucial stage of the research-development-innovation cycle, larger enterprises and/or research and technological organisations are asked to get together in order to provide a coordinated network of pilot line, test and validation services for SMEs in order to prepare for management decisions to progress to the next step of new technology deployment, i.e. installation of industrial pilot lines and enter the commercialisation stage.
Scope: The development of pilot lines: Pilot line development is expected to use an existing pilot line as a basis and may include new methods and/or instrumentation with real time characterization (including high-throughput) for measurement, analysis and operations at the nanoscale to characterise relevant materials properties, e.g. nanofillers dispersion, with improved resolution and/or increased sensitivity, based on novel approaches or novel combinations of approaches.
The operation of the pilot lines – testing and validation include: selection and tailoring of nano-particles/objects having the required interfacial interaction and/or compatibility with the matrix to be utilised in the nanocomposite; selection of a processing technique and optimization of process parameters addressing proper dispersion and distribution of nano-particles or nano-particle aggregates within the matrix; development of quality control and process verification.
Proposals should address a range of industrial applications and involve a number of composite producers, addressing in particular the needs of SMEs active in this sector. Plans for operating the network of pilot lines as well as the individual pilot line facilities after the end of EU financial support should be prepared within the proposal, including business plans for the cooperation with SMEs.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1] The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
The implementation of this proposal is intended to start at TRL 4-5, target TRL 6. Implemented as cross-KET activities.

Specific challenge:
A range of industrial processes (e.g. roll to roll, sheet to sheet) exist for high volume manufacturing involving flexible substrates. The use of these processes has widened from paper and textiles to advanced multi-layer coatings and/or stacks, and to new industries with applications e.g. in electrical circuits, electronic components and bio-functional constructs, comprising integrated combinations of several printed multifunctional materials. Currently there is significant interest on the part of manufacturers in adapting these high throughput technologies for the miniaturisation of feature sizes to the nanoscale, which would provide a new and disruptive manufacturing technology. There is a need to develop high speed, high resolution print technologies, integrating several materials aiming at material properties comparable or better than what is achievable with traditional manufacturing techniques.

","08 September 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: Low-energy solutions are badly needed for water softening and especially for water desalination. The present technologies for large scale desalination of seawater are stuck at energy consumption rates around 3 kWh/m3 whilst the target has been set at 1 kWh/m3 years ago.
Scope: Approaches that may bring better performance and lower energy use may be based on (but are not limited to) a combination of membrane filtration (reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration incl. micro-nano filtration) and applying electric potential, electrochemical membrane processes, membrane distillation, selective ion conducting materials, or crystallisation of clathrates. Projects should develop integrated solutions or combinations of technologies that come closer to the mentioned target.
Projects should aim at developing pilot plants demonstrating the low energy consumption as well as the overall competitiveness of the technology.
The implementation of this proposal is intended to start at Technology Readiness Levels 4-5, target Technology Readiness Levels 6-7.
In line with the objectives of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with developing countries.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                   Contribution to one of the main global societal issues – access to safe and pure water;
                   Improved performance, energy efficiency and usability of high-performance water purification systems;

","03 March 2014
","17 December 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge: Research results should be taken up by industry, harvesting the hitherto untapped potential of nanotechnologies, advanced materials and advanced manufacturing and processing technologies. The goal is to create added value by creatively combining existing research results with other necessary elements,[1] to transfer results across sectors where applicable, to accelerate innovation and eventually create profit or other benefits. The research should bring the technology and production to industrial readiness and maturity for commercialisation after the project.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50 000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
 Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the commercial uptake of nanotechnologies, advanced materials and advanced production technologies in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

(2)  To validate the tools and methodology, as well as their background data-sets, that will lead to the manufacture of novel, inherently safe nanomaterials.
(3)  To address barriers for the application of Safe-by-Design as standard industry practice.
The project should seek to establish principles for grouping strategies for nanomaterials according to their assumed modes of toxicological action for regulatory purposes. Out of each group, a few representative materials should be selected and a toxicological profile shall be assessed. The scope may include novel materials, coated materials and self-assembled materials, nanomaterials with different surface functionalisation, and third generation particles. The project should take into account future dossier requirements under REACH, or other related EU legislation, to limit the required additional information, especially animal testing, to the essential minimum. Active participation of industrial partners is strongly encouraged to establish strong industry-authorities collaboration and the partners should conclude a results communication policy before the start of the project. This collaboration should be complemented by solid mechanisms networking state and private laboratories in nanotechnology toxicity testing and exposure control.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Level 5.
 The Commission considers that, in addition to requested EU contribution between EUR 6 and 10 million, proposals should gather sufficient resources from EU Member States and Associated Countries to allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one proposal will be funded.
 Expected impact: The project is expected to:
    Strengthen seamless collaboration among authorities of the EU Member States and Associated Countries with regard to the knowledge required for appropriate risk assessment and management in this field given the fast development of the market;
  Bring together the activities of national authorities responsible for consumer and worker protection, public health, and the environment including chemical safety and all other relevant authorities covering the whole value;
   Coordinate regulatory oriented activities of, or cooperate with, other on-going projects on toxicity testing, on decision making for material characterisation and testing protocols, and for data management; and
  Integrate its work with OECD-WPMN, CEN[1] and ISO, and other European funded projects in the nanosafety cluster.

Specific challenge: The development of a novel safety culture for the nanomaterial research and engineering community, and the industry producing engineered nanomaterials and nano-enabled products is a significant challenge in the coming years. Incorporating the safety-by-design as an integral part of the core research activities of nano material sciences and the production of these materials and products would be a major step forward in assuring nanosafety. Such activities are currently on going in the EU and several other industrialised countries in a rather fragmented manner, necessitating specifically oriented action beyond the efforts foreseen in the context of individual projects. The increasing efforts of emerging economies and emerging science countries should also be integrated with the leading actors in the area of nanosafety.
Scope:
The main aim is to bring together EU Member and Associated states and international efforts for risk assessment, management and governance by streamlining data acquisition, collection and management on regulatory oriented toxicology testing of nanomaterial, exposure monitoring, LCA, and disposal and treatment of waste nanomaterials. The coordination may focus on one or more of the following tracks:
Coordination of EU and international efforts in support of regulation, in  particular within the context of NANOREG and NANOREG II, which is a major undertaking jointly funded by FP7, EU Member States, FP7 Associated States and industry, and of the work carried out by OECD-WPMN and standardisation bodies such as ISO or CEN;
Expanding the international dimension of EU nano-safety research e.g. through networking of researchers, twinning of projects or creation of Communities of Research with the objective of sharing of best practises and harmonising test methods.
 Widening the coordination of MS, AS and regional R&D efforts aimed at management of nano-related risks with the objective of pooling resources for a transnational programme of nano-safety research along the lines of the nanosafety cluster Strategic Research Agenda 2015-2020.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
• By exploiting synergies with, mainly national European but also world-wide, activities aiming at support to regulation, the project should lead to joint projects, twinned projects and global networks facilitating the goal of risk management and incorporating risk assessment in the early stages of product or process design
• The project should combine efforts with those of the Nanoreg project so that the expected datasets from the latter be complemented and cross validated with similar datasets from other projects running globally in order to reach OECD - MAD (Mutually Accepted Data) status identifying and brushing-out any inconsistencies.
• The impact of the NANOREG initiative, in establishing a seamless cooperation between industry, including risk engineering, and authorities, should be enhanced and expanded to include global market leaders.
• The project is expected to promote standardisation at international level.

Specific challenge: A potential nanomaterial risk for humans and the environment is present only when both exposure and a hazard potential of the nanomaterial exist. The challenge is to address the prediction of environmental distribution, concentration and form (speciation) of nanomaterials. It includes release and exposure studies using laboratory, field and model simulations of possible release and transformation of nanomaterials transport and fate, availability and bioaccumulation potential, to allow early assessment of potential exposure and facilitate safe product design.
Scope: The testing and modelling framework to be developed must allow prediction of the release and fate of nanomaterials over relevant whole product chains from manufacturing, downstream application and use, including waste and accidents, consumer use, to end-of-life recycling or disposal and final environmental fate. The predictive framework to be developed should include basic geographical and demographic considerations for uses, and address the physico-chemical characterisation at the release sources as well as the identification of the main mechanisms and nanomaterial properties driving their transformation and fate. The framework should enable predictive mapping of zones of accumulations and exposure potential (including the final aging transformations, forms and uptake availabilities) of nanomaterials in these “environmental sinks” and hot spots.
A close collaboration with stakeholders and different industries should be envisaged, to enhance realistic modelling and testing.

•  an overall validated framework that ensures the completeness and quality of information and data needed for understanding and predictive modelling of environmental transport and transformation
•  understanding of the interplay of the different transformation, transport, and aging mechanisms determining environmental exposure

Specific challenge: Systems biology, high throughput screening and toxicogenomics approaches have the potential to revolutionise how chemical substances, including nanomaterials, are assessed for regulatory and risk management purposes. A paradigm shift in toxicology using innovative techniques such as High Thoughput Screening (HTS) approaches, Toxicogenomics and High Content Analysis (HCA) is being established. With such approaches it is possible to identify underlying affected pathways (so called ‘toxicity pathways’). The challenge is to develop and demonstrate a mechanism-based understanding of toxicity, which will enable improved toxicity testing by identifying novel endpoints essential to tailor-made first tier hazard and risk assessment of novel and emerging materials.
Scope: Projects should enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying any observed adverse effects from engineered nanomaterials, and ultimately link the potential for such adverse effects to specific physical or chemical nano scale properties.
They should establish and demonstrate the basis for the development of appropriate tools to maximise read across (taxa and nano properties) and assess which tools or endpoints may not necessarily be applicable across the board. These approaches should aim to support the grouping of nanomaterials, to help in developing intelligent testing strategies and identifying ""nanomaterials or properties of concern"" that need to be tested more thoroughly.

•    New screening tools to enhance the efficiency of end-rate at which nanomaterial hazard profiling can be performed
•     Facilitate faster definition of nanomaterials toxicity mechanisms

Specific challenge: The conventional risk assessment approach, i.e. deriving no-effect levels or limit values from dose-effect relationships is inadequate for enabling safe use for newly developed materials in the fast moving market of nanomaterials. The challenge is to build a state-of-the art and flexible risk banding tool to keep pace with developments in innovation and risk research by harvesting and implementing results from concluded, ongoing and planned research in next generation risk governance frameworks. For nanotechnology, as with any new and rapidly evolving technology, analysis of risk is technically and methodologically limited, and thus associated with a high degree of uncertainty which should be understood and quantified. Stakeholders' concerns, including those of the insurance sector, and risk perception should be understood and communicated. Risk acceptance is strongly affected by a clear understanding of the risks, the benefits and the uncertainties perceived on equity and trust.
Scope: Research should focus on the testing, the calibration and the further development of risk prioritisation (or banding) tools for both human and environmental risks, with emphasis on:
a) the use of inputs from computational toxicology and/ or ‘high concern grouping approaches’ in risk banding tools to identify potential hot spots for risk,
b) Scientific foundation of the ‘risk bands’, by linking the hazard based with ‘dose’ relevant exposure banding,
c) Inclusion of data and monitoring strategies on the efficacy of risk mitigation measures and
d) Alignment with user capacities and needs, including ensuring the ability of the nanomaterial sector to avail of risk transfer/insurance. 
The selected project should identify the major processes of individual and societal decision making, placing particular attention on the aspect of uncertainty. To ensure the highest possible quality in regulatory decision making, emphasis should be given to the development of guidance for important issues in Risk Assessment, based on in-depth analysis of the current scientific basis concerning the addressed hazards and the possible exposure, and joining forces with other projects

•  A framework for the risk governance of nanomaterials entering the market by developing tools for risk appraisal, risk transfer and guidance for risk communication;
•  Demonstration in specific industrial settings or industrial sectors of the feasibility of the developed approaches and tools through worked examples as case studies and pilots with outcomes as guidance, good practices and tools for risk management and risk communication;
•  Leveraging and building on current knowledge related to hazard mapping, exposure and control banding and risk prioritization as well on inter/national and company level risk governance and risk dialogue efforts with key stakeholders including regulators and insurers.

Specific challenge: An integral part of the LEIT-NMP part of Horizon 2020 is to organise events of a major strategic nature. Examples are events organised together with successive EU presidencies; and also EuroNanoForum, Manufuture, NMP Conferences and World Manufacturing Forum. The proposed Support Action(s) should contribute to creating better synergy between initiatives launched by the Commission and by the Member States, to the benefit of the coherence of the overall actions within the field of research and innovation within the Industrial Leadership part. Member States which will hold a forthcoming Presidency of the European Union are Latvia and Luxemburg in 2015, and The Netherlands and Slovakia in 2016, and they may be particularly interested in this topic.
In order to ensure high political and strategic relevance, the active involvement of the competent National Authority(ies) will be evaluated.
Proposals should address topics of major relevance at the time of the events. An appropriate equilibrium should be present in the proposed action(s), with balanced presentations of various research and industrial elements and points of view. Participation of non-EU actors is possible. Outreach activities may be included, such as a press programme or events dedicated to the wider public or schools.

Specific challenge: Micro- & nanofluidics is an interdisciplinary field which brings together several KETs, finds application in most Grand Societal Challenges (high TRL), and is also characterized by new and exciting technological developments (low TRL). While commercial product success stories already exist (e.g. inkjet printheads), system integration, manufacturability and affordability remain significant challenges for micro-& nanofluidics applications with multiple or more complex functionalities. The field is characterised by a high number of research groups and enterprises developing knowledge and technology for many diverse application fields.
Scope: Because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the applications of micro- and nanofluidics, often involving other KETs, a clustering approach could bring about benefits through cross-fertilisation (e.g. reporting of technological progress; exchange or licensing of IPR) and identification of value chain elements required for industrial success. Clustering and networking activities could also include identification and preparation for demonstration and pilot-line activities, as well as other support activities that would be required, e.g. forming of industry alliances, pre-commercial procurement and (formal or industrial) standardisation. The final target is to tackle the bottleneck of deploying micro- & nanofluidics in Europe, in order to foster innovation in products and/or processes and/or the sustainability of our industrial economy.

The action should facilitate transition from Horizon 2020 to the first Horizon Europe calls, by enabling a degree of continuity in transnational cooperation between national support structures (e.g. National Contact Points – NCPs), taking into account previous knowledge and best practices within Horizon 2020.
Scope:
Proposed activities should deliver tangible benefits to potential applicants, capitalising on the work of the previous NCP Academy project, and relevant work of the other previous NCP network projects. The work will primarily consist of training activities for newly nominated NCPs, focusing on the rules and procedures of the new programme, and cross-cutting issues (e.g. embedding of social sciences and humanities).
This support should be extended to newly nominated national support structures for all parts of Horizon Europe, helping them become rapidly acquainted with the rules and procedures of the new programme.
Furthermore, a separate work package should include, when necessary, specific support to transnational initiatives related to Horizon Europe components (e.g. events; tools) designed to prepare applicants for the first calls.
In all cases, the proposal should show that training and other activities are organised efficiently, with an appropriate balance of on-line and physical interactions, and designed with a multiplier effect, taking account of training to be organised by the Commission, and of activities organised at national level.
The proposal should include specific tasks and budget (e.g. travel costs) to facilitate the involvement of all eligible NCPs, not taking part in the proposal consortium.
To help close the innovation divide, a substantial component of the proposed activities must be devoted to activities aimed at helping national support structures in those countries that have been participating at low levels in the Horizon 2020. These activities should help these national support structures rapidly acquire the know-how on support operations accumulated in other countries including, for example, training, mentoring, and twinning. They may also include awareness raising actions aimed at increasing visibility of well-qualified potential applicant organisations in the above mentioned countries.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Ocean energy could provide clean, predictable, indigenous and reliable energy and contribute to the EU's objective of reaching a share of renewables of at least 32% of the EU’s gross final consumption by 2030.
The EU is currently the global leader in ocean energy technologies.
The Commission adopted in 2014 a Communication on Blue Energy, which recognised the immense potential of harnessing the power of our seas and oceans. It is also one of the sectors that were identified in the Commission's Blue Growth Communication as an area where EU action can complement initiatives by the Member States to help this nascent industry develop faster and establish a new industrial sector.
The Ocean Energy Strategic Roadmap “Building Ocean Energy for Europe” published in November 2016 identified de-risking environmental consenting as a key challenge. The development of fit-for-purpose, effective and efficient licensing systems for ocean energy projects across Member States is essential at this stage of development of the sector. This was further confirmed as a priority area for cooperation with member states in the SET Plan Ocean Energy implementation plan adopted by the adopted by SET plan steering committee in March 2018.
Strategic planning is necessary to prevent future conflicts with other sea users and to ensure minimal impact of ocean energy deployment on the marine environment. Early and coordinated environmental assessment procedures under applicable environmental legislations (Directives on Strategic Environmental Assessment Environmental Impact Assessment, Marine Strategy Framework, Habitats, Birds, NATURA 2000 and Maritime Spatial Planning) and the respective national legal rules are fundamental in ensuring compliance and stakeholders' involvement.
Developers’ application for consent requires a sound understanding of environmental assessment and processes applied to ocean energy. However, deployments of ocean energy devices are without precedent and there is limited empirical data that could inform the regulatory process. Obtaining consent for an emerging technology such as ocean energy can be time consuming and costly. This also entails the need for public information, consultation and support. Consenting processes, thus, need to be anticipated, tailored and proportionate.
Close environmental monitoring and impact assessment and an early understanding of these aspects will benefit the current and future deployments of the ocean energy sector as a whole, by putting in place a guiding framework within which to establish protocol for regulatory assessments, licensing, control and monitoring. This will help to steer the transition from research and development to commercial deployment of new technologies.
This is the second call for proposals in this area launched with support of the EMFF.
The general objectives of this call for proposals are:
To increase the amount of environmental data and improve knowledge on assessing possible impacts of ocean energy devices (wave, tidal and ocean thermal energy conversion) deployed at sea;
To contribute to reducing uncertainty in modelling potential impacts of future ocean energy devices;
To provide guidance to ocean energy developers and to public competent authorities in charge of licencing and maritime planning ;
To inform stakeholders and help feed the public debate

Expected outputs:
Projects under this action should achieve concrete outputs within the project duration. The proposal must clearly describe the specific outputs of the project in terms of:
Improved environmental information on deployments of ocean energy devices at sea condition in test centres or commercial sites;
Identified and covered gaps in knowledge in the area of consenting and licencing;
Increased exchange of information on environmental status and possible impacts of ocean energy devices between EU Member States consenting authorities;
Increased awareness of and education in environmental monitoring, control and maritime spatial planning;
Increased public awareness, engagement and social acceptance of ocean energy projects;
Development and integration of publicly available recommendations and tools (for decision makers, developers, stakeholders, etc.), which will be used to improve and streamline processes and reduce duplication of efforts;
Facilitate the identification and selection of sites as well as future consenting;
Integration/Updating environmental data platform aligned with relevant existing legislation and initiatives (e.g. EMODnet, Inspire Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Maritime Spatial Planning, etc.).

Specific challenge: Industrial investments into research, technological development and innovation in Europe, in particular with the aim to bridge the valley of death and prepare new manufacturing capacities, will often need a combination of funding instruments, including EU, national and regional funding, making use of structural and regional funds, as well as private financing. The KET High Level Group underlines the need for efficient combination of funding as a key factor for investments into large-scale pilot lines as a crucial step towards commercial exploitation of new developments. New public programmes are being developed and implemented in connection with the next EU multi-annual financial framework including Horizon 2020 and regional and structural funds. While the responsible authorities are committed to make the instruments compatible, industrial stakeholders including SMEs need to understand what this means, how best to use this for their project, and how to combine public support with private financing as needed. They need to satisfy the different requirements in relation to project quality, cooperation arrangements, reporting, risks and other aspects, while also smart specialisation strategies, competition and state aid rules as well as the industrial decision structures need to be respected.
Scope:  A coordination action should bring public and private stakeholders together to structure the key questions for the funding of large-scale RDI projects through different funding sources. A number of different though typical cases, should be prepared for concrete investments combining different public and private funding and financing sources, e.g. representing specific KET or preferably cross-KET applications, large and small organisations, larger or smaller consortia etc. While the focus should be on the NMP areas and biotechnologies, the other KETs may also be represented (especially as cross-KETs applications).  On this basis practical needs, decision parameters, need for advice and support and best practices will be analysed, covering the entire process of decision making and preparation of actions on the private as well as public side, and taking into account the situation of individual organisations as well as consortia.  Overall, the action should help to provide guidance for stakeholders as well as policy makers on the combination of funding instruments and establish recommendations for European policy measures as relevant.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 500 000 and 1 000 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one proposal will be funded.
Expected impact:   Increasing the number of projects using combinations of funding instruments, acceleration of investments into pilot lines and other relevant RDI follow-up activities towards commercialisation, lessons learned for EU policy making, better definition of public funding instruments in view of their compatibility, improving the awareness and knowledge on funding and financing strategies in industry.

 Specific challenge: An integral part of the LEIT-NMP part of Horizon 2020 is to organise events of a major strategic nature. Examples are events organised together with successive EU presidencies; and also EuroNanoForum, Manufuture, NMP Conferences and World Manufacturing Forum. The proposed Support Action(s) should contribute to creating better synergy between initiatives launched by the Commission and by the Member States, to the benefit of the coherence of the overall actions within the field of research and innovation within the Industrial Leadership part. Member States which will hold a forthcoming Presidency of the European Union are Latvia and Luxemburg in 2015, and The Netherlands and Slovakia in 2016, and they may be particularly interested in this topic.
In order to ensure high political and strategic relevance, the active involvement of the competent National Authority(ies) will be evaluated.
Proposals should address topics of major relevance at the time of the events. An appropriate equilibrium should be present in the proposed action(s), with balanced presentations of various research and industrial elements and points of view. Participation of non-EU actors is possible. Outreach activities may be included, such as a press programme or events dedicated to the wider public or schools.
Scope: The commitment of the national authorities to support the event(s) (from a political point of view, but also with resources) should be a pre-requisite to submit a proposal. The application should be supported by the competent Minister, in a letter added to the application.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 300 000 and 600 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one action will be funded for each Presidency (possibly covering more than one event).
Expected impact:
Review of research, industrial and/or societal developments linked to the Industrial Leadership part areas, as appropriate;
Sharing of information and comparison of points of views; and
Networking various stakeholders and supporting their activities, e.g. natural scientists, social scientists, researchers, industrialists, investors, environmentalists, museums and schools.

","Inducement Prize
","28 September 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Internet has come to play an integral part in the lives of many European citizens. A large majority of people believe and even accept that there is no alternative other than to provide personal information if they want to obtain products or services online. The reliance on digital technology and the transfer of personal data to enable the use of online services come with substantial security risks however, such as online fraud and identity theft. A significant part of data breaches involve weak authentication credentials.
Password protection has been the default method of authentication online to date. This simple mechanism has many advantages, but the use of usernames and passwords in practice is severely flawed in both security and usability. Other solutions, typically employed in conjunction with passwords in a multi-factor approach, usually improve the robustness of the authentication. However, the increased security of multi-factor authentication has come at the price - limited usability and privacy concerns for individuals and increased costs for providers. Users often find multi-factor authentication (MFA for short) cumbersome and a burden in terms of time and effort. This burden is then transferred to providers who find it challenging to register or even retain users. In addition to this limitation, providers are also confronted with the high costs of MFA as the method often requires additional hardware.
Another significant concern for citizens is privacy. A number of authentication methods, such as the ones based on biometric traits, rely on the collection of large amounts of sensitive personal data. However, these approaches typically fail to assure citizens' trust by giving visibility over how this collected data is used and stored.
There is a clear need for a simple, secure and privacy-friendly way of seamlessly authenticating individuals online.
This Horizon prize aims to significantly improve citizen's overall experience related to online authentication and consequently foster the widespread adoption of services and products provided within the Digital Single Market of the European Union.
This prize also complements the activities of the Cybersecurity cPPP which aims to develop Europe's strengths in digital security.
Expected Impact:
An information and communication technologies (ICT) solution that enables citizens to seamless authenticate themselves across a wide range of applications and devices. The solution should be easy to use, reliable, robust against cyber-attacks, privacy-friendly and compatible as well as affordable and open. It should be ready to benefit a wide range of the EU population, from healthy to impaired citizens of all ages."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The current time period is characterised by rapid changes in many domains – geopolitical, economic, environmental and technological – which have huge effects on the global security situation. For the EU and for EU Member States it is therefore essential to continuously perform strategic technology foresight analyses so as to gain understanding of important trends and their defence and security implications. Essential parts of strategic technology foresight analysis are Horizon Scanning and Technology Watch (HS&TW): the signalling of emerging threats, the identification of emerging technologies and potential opportunities combined with a broad analysis of relevant technological developments. Performing a strategic technology foresight is challenging, not only because it is an activity aimed at a “moving target”, but also because it is not easy to identify and track the wide range of relevant technologies to be addressed in view of:
the added value of a common European approach in properly covering the full range of technologies and sources;
the need to build a common understanding of future technology and its impact on defence trends in order to plan and coordinate accordingly our actions;
the need for an innovative approach with respect to the way these activities traditionally are conducted;
the growing relevance of the civil technologies for defence and the need to include the developments in the civil sector in the exercise;
identifying new technologies.
Scope:
This action should aim to support strategic technology foresight in the defence domain of individual Member States and of the EU as a whole by performing joint technology foresight activities supported by methodologies such as horizon scanning, technology watch, scientometric tools, expert consultation activities. The action should focus in particular on identifying emerging defence research areas for potential exploration in the next Multi-annual Financial Framework. The action should propose and validate a methodology and process for strategic technology foresight activities to be carried out cyclically. Such a methodology should take into account similar activities conducted in EDA, NATO and other military and/or civil organisations. Activities that should be considered could include, amongst others:
Collection of information (national sources, EU research programme, occidental and non-occidental sources);
Analysis (geopolitical trends, defence and security trends, technology, industrial trends);
Engagement with European industry trade bodies;
Evaluation/assessment for defence and security (future scenario-based evaluations such as Disruptive Technology Assessment Games, consultations of technology and military experts, input from “unconventional” groups with an outside view, more creative thinking, …);
Defining and setting up strategic trends for the medium and long term;
Management and controlled dissemination of results (secure web-based access with public and restricted dissemination).
The strategic technology foresight should be coupled to a process and method for scoping EU-funded defence research based on scenarios to illustrate potential future conflicts.
Proposals should include elements to ensure continued monitoring and updating beyond the action's lifetime.
The European Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 0.8 to 1.0 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
The action should allow to
underpin coordination of defence research activities at the EU and national level;
prepare the long term agenda for defence research in the EU;
explore themes for a future European Defence Research Programme;
underpin coordination of agendas and optimisation of synergies between the EU defence and civil research activities under the next Multiannual Financial Framework;

","15 March 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Technology non dependence is an essential parameter of the strategic autonomy and freedom of action of the EU Member States. Uninterrupted supply from trusted sources of key materials, including raw materials, components and technologies for critical armament systems is fundamental for the reliable use of military capabilities when and where needed. Trusted supply without limitations from non EU countries regarding the use or export is also essential for the competitiveness of the EU defence industry, allowing competing in global markets with technological solutions that do not have to respect third parties conditions.
In the short and medium term, technologies subject to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations (ITAR and EAR) are as a consequence a challenge for Member States and defence industry as they limit freedom of action and export. Furthermore also currently freely available components may become ITAR-related once they are used in US weapon systems. Technologies and materials from other non EU sources may also be procured with restriction of use and components are often not trustable for sensitive functions. Moreover supply may even be denied in some particular cases with potentially highly detrimental impact on systems and operations. To support Europe’s strategic autonomy availability of selected ITAR restricted and other foreign-sourced components and materials in Europe would be as beneficial for Member States as for Europe’s defence industry.
Avoiding long term critical defence technology dependencies is equally important for the future strategic autonomy of the EU. Identifying critical technology building blocks for future defence systems and disruptive capabilities and preparing the necessary steps to have them available on time, is indispensable in order to avoid staying behind from the global competitors, prevent future technology dependencies and ensure the independent development of cutting edge capabilities.
To gain an overview about the technology dependence challenge, a stocktaking of ITAR and other non EU sourced components used in Europe’s armament systems would be the first step to tackle this issue. A methodology consulting Member States and defence industry would need to assess the sourcing risk and criticality in order to identify and prioritize components and materials desirable to be available in Europe in the future. For selected technologies, roadmaps and business models can be produced to provide proposals for research topics for a follow on defence research programme.
Scope:
This action should aim to provide an effective way for tackling the issue of the critical defence technological dependencies for the EU regarding current and future systems and capabilities. The action needs to address at least the following activities:
(a) Mapping of the ITAR and other non EU sourced components and materials in the systems developed by the EU industry and used and to be used by the EU armed forces. The mapping should cover the dependencies in the full spectrum of the value chain, possibly down to the raw material sourcing;
(b) Identify critical technology building blocks and possibly components for future systems and disruptive capabilities for which European technology non-dependence will be crucial. The activity should be based on the results of the European Defence Technology Runway Part I on future trends and aim to identify the major technical challenges in these critical areas for which non-dependence will be crucial;
(c) Develop a methodology to assess the supply risk of technologies and components of point a) and b) and their criticality for armed forces and the defence industry. Such methodology should be established in consultation with ministries of defence and the defence industry;
(d) Prepare technology roadmaps, ideally including cost substantiated predictions, and suggest business models for selected technologies, taking into account supply risk and criticality. An assessment of the scientific, technological and manufacturing readiness of the European ecosystem should be included. This activity should also propose actions in line with the technology roadmaps and suggested business models.
The activities should benefit and when appropriate complement or incorporate existing works, and in particular:
the European Defence Technology Runway Part I, for identifying technologies and sharing methodology as appropriate;
the study “Study on the dual-use potential of dual-use potential of Key Enabling Technologies (KETs)”[1];
the study “Raw materials in the European defence industry”[2] and relevant activities of the Joint Research Centre;
relevant work of the European Defence Agency, the “Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies - Space” research programme under Horizon 2020 and the European Space Agency (ESA), and in particular the Critical Space Technologies non-dependence actions for identified in the frame of the Commission-ESA-EDA Joint Task Force[3].
Proposals should include elements to ensure continued monitoring and updating beyond the action's lifetime.
The European Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Union in the range of EUR 1 500 000 to 1 900 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic is complementary with topic ""PADR-STF-01-2017: The European Defence Research Runway – part I"". Grant agreements under this topic will therefore include the options for 'complementary grants', (including, in particular additional access rights to background and results for the purposes of the complementary grant).
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
The action should allow
the EU and the Member States to understand the dependencies for defence technologies and the ways to prioritise and address them;
to underpin coordination of defence research activities at the European and national level and improve synergies with space and other civil technology research activities addressing non-dependence needs;
to provide input for the long term agenda for defence research in the EU in the area of critical defence technologies;

","Preparatory Action on Defence Research – Research Action
","07 June 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In a defence context, naval forces are engaged permanently, including in various types of conflicts, asymmetric or symmetric. They must control their environment in order to scan, detect and analyse as soon as possible the intentions of other forces and potential threats, in order to retain capacity of initiative, freedom of movement and to achieve the desired endeffect. In this respect, maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR), complemented with neutralisation capacities, is a key capability from a strategic or tactical perspective. The ISTAR chain is a critical enabler to the common Recognized Maritime Picture (RMP), for detection, identification, tracking and target acquisition, as well as for strengthening interoperability.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and other unmanned systems (UXS, in which ""X"" can stand for ""Aerial"", ""Surface"" or ""Underwater"") operated alongside other unmanned and manned systems can thereby provide significant added value to enhance such situational awareness. Yet efforts are needed for extending, amongst other parameters, the persistence, range and coverage in particular of UAS.
The integration of data from multiple sources operating in a complementary way, and the quality and capability to exchange data in real (or near real) time is needed to improve the interoperability between manned and unmanned systems within existing, multilateral EU defence systems and infrastructures, and with naval platforms and mission systems.
Scope:
Enhanced situational awareness in naval operations critically depends on the quality of (a) the sensor suite and (b) the exploitation/sharing of gathered data. Major potential for substantial improvements and step-up exist in these two domains:
as far as the sensor suite is concerned, a more extensive integration and use of unmanned systems offering enhanced performances and capacities compared to commercially available state-of-the-art assets, and operated in a complementary way with other types of platforms and sensors;
concerning data exploitation and sharing, potential for improvements are linked in particular to the real time or near real time and secured transfer of data.
This topic calls for proposals that convincingly remove technological obstacles, and combine innovation and integration, in order to demonstrate that situational awareness in a naval environment can be significantly improved.
In this context, technology demonstrations in two types of operational situations should are prioritised:
Persistent Wide Area Surveillance;
Maritime Interdiction Operations.
These operations cover the first phases of all naval operations conduct from naval ships or vessels. Although these operations might take on maritime security dimensions, they also need to cover genuine defence specific requirements. Specific maritime ISTAR assets are linked to the environment in which systems or equipment are operated such as:
Environmental conditions are in particular related to adverse weather, high sea levels, or day and night operations;
Strong electromagnetic fields (aspects of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and interference (EMI)), jamming or rupture of communications;
Deployment in contested environment implies also stealthy and survivability requirements;
The type of data to be exchanged requires levels of protection appropriate to defence-classified data. Moreover, for the needs of the missions, real time, or near real time exchange and transfer of data are necessary.
The objective of the technological demonstrator is to mature and bring technologies together, for enhancing situational awareness through unmanned systems working alongside manned systems in various complex and extreme environmental circumstances. On the one hand, the focus be on the integration of RPAS or other UXS into naval systems (ship interface & combat management system). On the other hand, considering various types of unmanned systems – e.g. aerial, surface and/or submersible platforms – the focus shall be on the transfer of relevant military data and fusing of this data with complementary data from space platforms or manned systems.
These two work-strands shall be conducted in a consistent manner, with the high level objective to improve situational awareness and provide a comprehensive picture of an operational situation enabling management of own assets, monitoring movement, and detection of threats in a contested environment that requires protective measures for cyber defence, electronic warfare, GPS-denial and platform/payload survivability.
More specifically, proposals should balance R&T efforts in the following two areas:
a) Integration in naval systems of close-to-market new or improved existing platforms demonstrator with improved sensors capacity, persistence and autonomy
Taking into account the necessity of increasing ISTAR in high sea naval operations, the use of RPAS or other UXS as platforms with appropriate payloads that would allow the use of improved sensors is expected to constitute a major asset in future capabilities.
Substantial technological progress is needed to develop RPAS or other UXS solutions which would be operated from navy ships and meet a number of defence specific requirements: payload capacity (several types of sensors, at least 2 major sensors on-board, persistence, endurance and range, autonomy and optimisation of operators work-load, EMC/EMI compatibility, operations (including launch and recovery) at sea from navy ships under extreme conditions, survivability, etc.
To achieve the desirable (and affordable) compromise between needs and solutions, and in terms of payload vs. platform, efforts are needed to remove technological obstacles concerning platform technologies, technologies related to the integration into military ship environment, payload and sensors architecture-related technologies, control systems and handling quality, autonomous operation, as well as security aspects.
The project should not aim at developing a new platform but focus on developing key technologies while using existing platforms, as a basis for developing this work strand of the project as well as for the demonstration testing.
Proposals would address aspects such as:
Platform protection in contested environments;
Anti-jamming and electronic counter-measures;
Capability to be launched and recovered from manned platforms also in severe meteorological conditions (objective: up to Sea State 5);
Autonomy motivated by the need to reduce manning, risk and cost of platform operation. Examples include: Autonomous piloting, anti-collision, automated replanning and execution, adaptive behaviour, automated fault management systems, local automated sensor processing, local situation awareness without man-in-the-loop, automatic launch and recovery;
Navigation need for accurate positioning and for establishing redundancy to GNSS;
High speed secure and real time or near real time communication including cyber protection;
Operation of the platform under severe climatological conditions;
Operation of the platform from navy ships under severe sea state conditions;
Improved sensors and payload capacity;
Capability of the platform to transport cargo/utility and to drop payloads;
If relevant, optionally piloted capability to allow maximum flexibility for larger types and demonstrate interaction and operational flexibility between manned, unmanned, optionally manned vehicles. The compatibility with STANAG 4586 (NATO UAV Control System), 4545 (NATO Secondary imagery format), 4609 (NATO Digital Motion Imagery Standard) should be ensured.
Proposals should underline the impact of new or improved existing platforms and of their technological content on, e.g., endurance, range, autonomy, payload capacity and trade-off between size/weight and performances, enhanced sensors performance, resilience and redundancy of Command and Control links and data links.
b) Demonstration of integration of data from multiple sources in a single predefined tactical picture
The demonstration should aim at evaluating the capability of a Maritime Operation Center (MOC) to acquire, exploit, correlate, analyse and disseminate securely sensor data and integrate it into a RMP in Near Real Time (NRT), making use of the current state of the art satellite imagery, Automatic Identification System (space and coastal), naval vessel, manned and unmanned systems.
The integration of data from those multiple sources should improve ISTAR in a single predefined tactical picture allowing faster, independent and more accurate use of combat systems of the naval military systems.
Concerning the data exchange, the main challenge should be placed on the capability to exchange data and ability to switch quickly between classified and unclassified channels with cyber issues. Data can be gathered by sensors on-board the UXS but also from a wider scope of sensor types and assets. Also progressing on the near real-time transmission (a datalink allowing full motion video in particular) remains an important challenge.
In addition, the demonstration may include the use of homogeneous or heterogeneous groups, i.e., mixing UAV with manned fixed and/or rotary wings, USV and/or UUV), equipped with different types of sensors.
Proposals should address aspects such as:
Determination of data exchange systems C4ISR;
Multi sensor information fusion;
Data request for area / time of interest;
Data analysis, exploitation and visualisation;
Operation planning and control;
Integration and interoperability with the vessel command and control (CMS) or a MOC;
Integration of sensor information provided by Member States (CISE, MARSUR);
Analysis of data requests (satellite, unmanned and manned aerial and naval systems);
High level of data processing integration, on board vehicle and possibly off board;
Close to real-time transmission (datalink allowing e.g. full motion video) and data fusion with long term history assessment and detection of anomalies;
Encryption and cyber security for exchange of classified information;
Simulation aspects for operators.
Proposals should underline (i) the improved interaction/coordination between (semi-) autonomous platforms and man-machine interaction and interface issues, (ii) improved quality of situational awareness compared to that provided by traditional assets (higher quality at lower risk and cost), (iii) impact in reduction of human involvement in operation. Proposals should also demonstrate that naval combat management systems will maximise the exploitation of the potential of unmanned systems through the development of a shared situational awareness. NATO-EU interoperability will be important in that regard as well as interoperability with civil systems if appropriate.
Proposals should therefore also include aspects such as:
Common architecture of mixed unmanned systems (aerial, surface, underwater) together with communication within the common systems architecture;
Common Information Exchange Infrastructure based on NATO compliant interfaces as a trusted system to allow to share and retrieve information with different levels of security;
Swarming behaviours and impact on automated vehicle behaviours and collision avoidance;
Exchange of specific information regarding target designation;
Anti-Area/Access-Denial (A2/AD) technologies offset;
(Service oriented) architecture open to air and land component to build a European C4ISTAR joint/combined system, reconfigurable during runtime;
Simulation environments for support design, validate solutions, train operators.
The activities of the project should focus mainly on maturing and integrating validated technologies. Part of the project can be carried out by using computer-based modelling and simulation tools, to allow de-risking of the demonstration. Moreover, the project shall provide a full-scale technological demonstration at least in a relevant environment of mixed manned/unmanned assets. If deemed appropriate, the proposal could include a demonstration in an operational environment, e.g., in conjunction with armed forces. A list of EU Member States armed forces that expressed their willingness to facilitate (part of) the demonstration activities can be found for information in the 'Additional documents'. There is no obligation for applicants neither to use nor to restrict themselves to the organisations contained in this list.
The proposal should include a high level description of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the envisaged functionalities and the methodologies on how to measure them. A report with a detailed description of these KPIs and methodologies in view of the demonstrations should be delivered within 6 months after the start of the project.
The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 4 and target TRL not lower than 6 and not higher than 7.

32 and 36 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Given the constraints on the yearly budget of the Preparatory Action, full proposals should include upon a single submission the description of (i) a core part which would need a EU contribution between EUR 14 and 16 million from the 2017 budget, and (ii) up to 4 additional research modules with a EU contribution of up to EUR 5 million each that would extend the core project to cover the topic more substantially. These research modules can receive funding from the 2018 budget subject to the adoption of the 2018 financing decision on the preparatory action and subject to the approval of the budget by the EU budgetary authorities. The proposals, including the total indicative budget of the core part and all additional modules will be evaluated in their entirety during a single-stage evaluation procedure.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
Convincing demonstration of the potential of EU-funded research for defence applications;
Reliable operation of the proposed solutions in various, complex and extreme maritime environments;
Substantial gain towards autonomous and safe operation of UXS from navy ships offering suitable potential in term of payload capacity, range and handling quality for operations under adverse conditions;
Enhancement of maritime situational awareness and command and control capability and secured data exchange and real time or near real time transmission of information;
Development of the European industrial capability in the market segment of unmanned systems for defence capabilities;
Improved interoperability between manned and unmanned systems;
Improved interoperability with existing, multilateral EU defence systems and infrastructures, and with naval platforms and mission systems;
Extended capabilities of a vessel platform, fully integrated with the vessel mission system (CMS and sensors);
Improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness;
Informing the shape of future military structures in view of the use of advanced unmanned systems.
Proposals should include a first demonstration of preliminary yet meaningful results during late 2019 (and in any event not before mid-2019) with the second and final demonstration during mid-2020. It is anticipated that both demonstrations should be alongside existing military platforms. The participation of SMEs in the proposal, if relevant, is strongly encouraged and this will be positively evaluated under the “Implementation” criterion."

","21 March 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Interoperability of defence systems is key for the ability of different forces to operate safely and effectively together in joint or combined operations. It can be challenging for the armed forces to achieve desired levels of interoperability. Interoperability relates on a technical level to the possibility of connecting or commonly using equipment and systems. This can be enhanced by e.g the use of open standards or joint architectures. But interoperability can also require interlocking processes and can even have implications on concepts of use and employment of systems. The increased use of unmanned systems (UXS, in which ""X"" can stand for ""A"" (aerial), ""S"" (surface), ""G"" (ground) or ""U"" (underwater)) of modern forces in multi-national operations require multi-national interoperability, cross-domain interoperability, effectiveness, as well as adaptability of systems to mission and mission intensity, which may imply upgrade and adoption of novel payloads or maintaining and upgrading equipment at state-of the art or standardising the human-machine interaction.
Scope:
Interoperability can exist at different levels. Proposals are invited to focus on interoperability and standardisation of systems, subsystems, components and procedures of complex UXS platforms in a network centric environment. Proposals can address, amongst other, topics such as:
the coordinated use of multiple platforms, datalink aspects (including standardised security), and standardisation of control stations to simultaneously control several platforms and to control the handover between stations;
intra-system interoperability: interoperability between the subsystems and payloads within a system, with standard interfaces, leading to plug-and-play connection capability, making it thus easier to install new and/or change mission payloads;
standardisation of the modules, interfaces and information formats to simplify the design of new and the upgrade of existing UXS;
robotic hardware standardisation to allow for the exchange of robotic elements in military applications;
interoperability between UXS; manned systems and UXS; soldiers, manned systems and UXS;
concepts for interoperability between military units utilizing autonomous systems.
The proposed activities should include a demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The proposals should include a high-level description of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the envisaged functionalities and the methodologies on how to measure them. A report with a detailed description of these KPIs and methodologies should be delivered within 6 months after the start of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Union up to EUR 1 500 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
When relevant, results publicly available from EDA and NATO activities and studies should be taken into account for the proposed work. The activities included in the proposals should clearly differentiate from or go beyond work already covered under relevant themes of the EU Programmes.
No more than one action will be funded.
The lifetime of the proposed project should not exceed 24 months.
Expected Impact:
convincing demonstration of EU-wide research cooperation in defence research;
promotion of intra-/inter-system interoperability for unmanned systems;
increase of modularity and reduction in life cycle costs for unmanned systems;
enhancement of the effectiveness of military personnel and systems."

The Intra-Africa Academic Mobility Scheme provides financial support to partnerships of African Higher Education Institutions for the organisation and the implementation of student and staff mobility in high quality master and doctoral programmes within African countries.
The overall objective of the programme is to enhance human capital development in Africa, while strengthening intra-African collaboration as called for by Agenda 2063.
The programme's specific objectives are to:
increase the employability of students;
improve the quality of higher education in Africa and its relevance to Africa's development vision;
strengthen the modernisation and internationalisation of African higher education institutions, and promote the development of an African higher education and research space.
Mobility of students and staff between Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is expected to help them acquire stronger knowledge and skills and contribute to improve the quality and relevance of teaching and learning through exchanges of practices. Within the African Union vision, this is also essential for developing higher education capacity to generate African solutions to African challenges and to build an African higher education and research space.
In addition, the scheme will contribute to strengthen the modernisation and internationalisation strategies of HEIs through the establishment of mechanisms to manage the mobility flows. This will in turn increase HEIs’ capacity to forge partnerships with other institutions to undertake joint collaboration and research.
Furthermore, the programme is bringing together HEIs from different regions which will have to set up adequate mechanisms to organise the exchanges, such as arrangements to compare curricula and recognise the study periods abroad. It is therefore expected that the programme will enhance harmonisation and standardisation of higher education in line with the African Union Strategy for Harmonisation of Higher Education. It will provide specific lessons for the implementation of the Pan African Quality and Accreditation Framework and make a substantial contribution to regional integration."

","03 May 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
On 1 April 2019, the European Commission adopted a work programme for 2019 for financing Pilot Projects and Preparatory Actions in the field of ""Communications Networks, Content and Technology""1.
The Web Accessibility Directive2 establishes common accessibility requirements to make the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies across the EU more accessible, in particular for persons with disabilities. The reference to the harmonised European Standard EN 301 549 v2.1.2 (‘HEN’)3 in support of the Directive was published in December 2018, providing presumption of conformity with the accessibility requirements set forth in the Directive.
Organizations beyond those in the scope of the Directive are also encouraged to follow accessibility best practices and conform to the HEN. By providing online and mobile services in a more accessible way, public sector bodies and private enterprises will reach more citizens and customers, thus reaping the economic and social benefits of web accessibility.
Incorporating features in authoring tools or platforms to meet accessibility requirements by default (""web access by default"") will provide an effective way to support compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive. These features will facilitate the creation and maintenance of accessible websites and mobile applications, thus accelerating the adoption of web accessibility standards.
The objective of this preparatory action is to support the adoption of the accessibility requirements set forth in the HEN when producing content for websites and mobile applications.
To that end, grants will be awarded to proposals developing authoring tools or platforms that help authors comply by default with the requirements of the HEN. Priority will be given to open-source or free-to-use solutions and to proposers involving users with disabilities, in particular in the validation process; accessibility of the tools or platforms for authors with disabilities will be considered an asset.
The expected results of this preparatory action are the following:
(accessible) authoring tools or platforms that help authors produce and maintain accessible content for websites and mobile applications by default, preferably validated by users with disabilities;
easier production of web and mobile content that complies with the accessibility requirements set out in the HEN, thus facilitating compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive;
wider take-up of web accessibility resulting from greater awareness of its benefits;
enhanced competition in the market for authoring tools and platforms with accessibility features.
The solutions supported under this preparatory action should automate as much as possible the features of authoring tools or platforms that provide accessibility by default. Where such automation is not possible, the authoring tools or platforms should minimise the need for technical intervention by the author (e.g. the tool/platform should trigger an automatic request to type in an alternative text description for a picture).
The proposals must take into consideration:
other internationally recognized guidelines and the state of the art in industrial practices on how authoring tools should help authors produce accessible content;
and
how to ensure that the user interface of these authoring tools or platforms is in itself accessible.
The proposed actions should aim to take into account the results and relevant recommendations of the pilot project financed under the call ""Application of web accessibility requirements in web-authoring tools and platforms by default (Web Access by Default)""4, when available.

Comparison between different countries and regions, demographic groups and cultures should be made in order to identify specific contextual links as well as to identify opportunities for exchange of knowledge and experience between countries and regions.
 Proposals should include the development of new methods or the adaptation of existing ones for this type of assessment. These methods and tools (including self-assessment tools) should be applied in different health systems and organisational infrastructures to test their applicability in different political, economic and societal contexts.
 Due attention should be paid from the outset to the further development and dissemination of methodological expertise, including capacity building across Europe, in order that the expertise generated is fully exploited.

","21 April 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: For their successful application, new therapies, such as gene or cell therapies, tissue engineering or regenerative medicine often require technological innovation in the form of development of specific component tools and techniques such as isolation and multiplication of a cell or development of a scaffold, delivery of the therapy to the patient and for following-up the effect of the therapy in the patient.
In particular, achieving therapeutic scale production and GMP standards at reasonable cost is often underestimated. In addition, specific attention needs to be given to aspects such as miniaturisation, automation, biomaterials and scaffold construction while advanced methods and devices for targeted and controlled delivery, and monitoring technology, are needed to bring these innovative treatments to the patient.
Since experience with the new therapies is by definition limited, achieving regulatory compliance for them is another challenge.
Scope: The term advanced therapies encompasses gene therapy, cell therapy, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and bio-artificial organs. These are biological approaches to therapy which often share common technologies.
Proposals should focus on refining a particular technological step or component needed by the therapeutic approach.
Establishing proof-of-concept for the new technology and carrying out preclinical research may be included if needed.
Regulatory aspects of the new technology should be addressed as appropriate.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         Development of tools and technologies enabling establishment of new therapies or patient interventions
         Supporting regulatory compliant new technologies

Specific challenge: A considerable amount of knowledge has been generated by biomedical research in recent years, yet most of the 6000-8000 rare diseases are lacking therapies despite many diseases being life-threatening or chronically debilitating.
Specific problems posed in therapy development for rare diseases include the small and dispersed patient populations[1] and the nature of the therapies proposed which are often highly specialised and novel requiring the advice of regulatory authorities during development. In addition the limited market for such therapies provides a low commercial return.
 Scope: Proposals may address one or more of the following: development of new or improved therapeutic approaches, for repurposing of existing therapies, as well as for preclinical research, animal model development and good manufacturing practice (GMP) production.
Proposed treatments to be developed may range from small molecule to gene or cell therapy.
Clinical trials shall only be supported in cases where ""orphan designation"" has been given by the European Commission and where the proposed clinical trial design takes into account recommendations from protocol assistance given by the European Medicines Agency and where a clear patient recruitment strategy is presented. The orphan medicinal product must have been granted the EU orphan designation[2] at the latest on the date of the Stage 2 call closure. A concise feasibility assessment justified by available published and preliminary results and supporting data shall also be provided.

Specific challenge: Digital personalised models, tools and standards with application for some specific clinical targets are currently available. There is however a need for greater integration of patient information, for example of multi-scale and multi-level physiological models with current and historical patient specific data and population specific data, to generate new clinical information for patient management. Any such integrative digital representation (Digital Patient) must also allow meaningful knowledge extraction and decision support.
Scope: Proposals should focus on new decision support systems (DSS) based on a complex integration of heterogeneous data sources and subject-specific computer models. This should enable an integrated data analysis, and should present a highly visual data representation, using user-friendly interactive exploratory interfaces in order to assure usability and acceptability.
Proposals should enable the use of DSS by healthcare professionals for personalised prediction and decision in prevention, diagnosis or treatment and should take into account data protection and ethical considerations, as well as those pertaining to the inherent uncertainties and limits of prediction. The models should be already available, multi-level and multi-scale and will be integrated with the individual and population data relevant for the targeted clinical situations, e.g.  the required molecular and cellular data, including genomics and epi-genomics, in vivo and in vitro imaging data, or data on administration of therapeutics and on nutrition/exposure to environmental factors and will be linked when relevant with computer models of personalised physiology, functional disorders and other diseases. The proposed systems should take advantage of the personal medical data accumulated over time. Proposals should include the standardisation of data formats. The integration of data coming from other new technologies for e.g. key-enabling technologies should be considered. Gender and ethical issues should be duly considered.

Specific challenge:Recent technological advances in molecular biology, biomedical sciences and systems biology have enabled a greatly increased rate of data generation and the production of many different types of data. Furthermore, these new technologies are gradually becoming much less expensive and more accessible to individual laboratories and clinics. The rate of data generation at a local level is therefore set to increase dramatically.
Currently available bioinformatics tools are however insufficient to maximise the use of these new, diverse and complex data. Deficiencies exist in data collection, storage, organisation, integration, analysis and exploitation is therefore not optimal. Network bioinformatics requires support in Europe in order to maintain scientific competitiveness.
Scope: Proposals should ensure that bioinformatics capabilities are not only made adequate for the current data challenge but are also able to meet future biomedical and clinical needs. Proposals should focus on the development of new mathematical, statistical and computational methods, to address specific bottlenecks in bioinformatics that hold back better understanding, integration and use of biomedical and clinical research data. The needs include, but are not limited to: better data capture, organisation and storage; improved data analysis and processing methodologies, and interoperability; new approaches for data integration (e.g. different types and sources, integration of the time component); new approaches to data standardisation, including development of both preclinical and clinical standard operating procedures, ensuring data consistency and sharing while also complying with data protection requirements; improving accessibility and user-friendliness of biomedical and clinical research data. Close links between developers and envisaged end- users of the new methods must be ensured from the start of all successful proposals, as must widespread dissemination of the new methods. Commercial development should be a goal where appropriate.

Specific challenge: Current approaches assessing the safety of chemical substances in humans are expensive and time consuming, and may be of limited relevance as a predictor of adverse effects. Better approaches are needed both to improve the efficiency of predictive toxicological testing to address key areas of concern for human health and to meet regulatory requirements (e.g. EU legislations on REACH, cosmetics, biocides). Safety testing is of worldwide concern and therefore international cooperation may be an important element in addressing the challenge.
 Scope: Proposals should capitalise on advances in all relevant fields of science to understand complex biological pathways of toxicological relevance and to identify early markers predictive of toxicological effects in humans with the objectives of developing and validating routine, non-animal approaches for toxicity testing of chemical substances (excluding radio-chemicals). The research may include the development of methodologies for confirmatory testing of mechanistic hypotheses to improve understanding of toxicity mechanisms.
 Proposals should involve, amongst others, research communities, SMEs, industry and regulatory agencies as appropriate. Proposals should demonstrate efficient mechanisms for the co-ordination of activities and exchange of information, and should include a timeline for delivery of test methods.
 In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation[1] in research and innovation, cooperation is encouraged with similar initiatives in the USA and elsewhere, and would be highly beneficial from scientific and economic standpoints.
 Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) as an added value in order to provide an effective interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects and/or to translate the research results into validated test methods and strategies fit for regulatory purpose. In that respect, the JRC will collaborate with any successful proposal.
 Applicants are encouraged to seek during the life-time of the project additional support from various sectors in order to facilitate translational aspects.
 The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 30 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact:
More effective, faster, cheaper toxicological testing to better predict human risk and meet regulatory needs.
Improved toxicological knowledge to encourage ‘read across’ between chemical substances for use in different research and regulatory domains.
Commercial exploitation of the developed toxicological testing methods and assessment approaches, products and services.
Advancement of international co-operation in the field of predictive toxicology and human safety testing.
Reduced use of laboratory animals in safety testing.

","Coordination and support action
","11 December 2013
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: There are a number of challenges to effective eHealth service deployment in Europe, each of which is to be addressed by an individual Co-ordination and Support Action as below.
(i) There is little stakeholder consensus on a common reference information model for eHealth deployment in Europe, and it seems unlikely that international consensus can be reached for common (clinical) reference standards in a reasonable timeframe and budget. It is therefore reasonable to ask whether competing / overlapping standards can co-exist in a common eHealth European interoperability framework; this is of relevance to the MoU on eHealth between the EC and the US department of Health and Human services.
(ii) The Directive on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (Directive 2011/24/EU) pursues the objective to enhance safety and continuity of cross-border treatment through interoperable access to patients' summary data and interoperable ePrescriptions. The challenge in ePrescription is how medicines can be communicated in the cross border setting. There is neither a common data model nor a common vocabulary for medicinal or pharmaceutical products throughout Europe.
(iii) The clinical domain is probably among the most complex from a semantic point of view. Vocabularies, terminologies, classification and coding systems, and ontologies have been developed by different stakeholders to address different needs in different subdomains. The semantic health report had already demonstrated the central role that SNOMED CT[1] could play as a core terminology to solve semantic interoperability issues, provided that ""evidence-based results of SNOMED CT’s fitness for purpose are assessed"". The epSOS pilot project has retained SNOMED CT as one of the constituents of its master value sets catalogue which ensures semantic interoperability across the borders in the frame of the pilot. More recently, the eHealth Network called on the Commission to play a more active role in assessing the value of SNOMED CT for eHealth deployments in Europe. A detailed analysis on the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the impact of using SNOMED CT as the core terminology at the EU level is needed.
(iv) The Connecting Europe Facility will provide the funding and the governance framework to deploy cross border eHealth Services, among other digital services, until 2020. The intention is to migrate progressively the Connecting Europe facility from a publicly funded initiative to a self-financed operation. There is a need to identify the right business model and plan which would identify sustainable sources of revenue and all the costs which the operations of such services would generate. Gathering evidence that interoperability contributes to lowering the cost of health systems is an important element for decision makers when they have to envisage eHealth investments.
Scope: (i) The proposal should at minimum build on existing CEN, ISO, and HL7 standards. The need for a formal standardization activity in the area should be demonstrated, as well as a realistic roadmap with concrete deliverables. Alternative scenarios should be envisaged. Proposals should build on existing initiatives and EU projects in the area. Proposals should ensure sufficient involvement of stakeholders (including at least Member States, Industry and international standards development organisations (SDOs)), consensus building and endorsement of the work carried out and of the submitted deliverables. Contribution to the EU eHealth Interoperability Framework should be demonstrated. The successful proposal should support large scale deployments of eHealth services (including cross border) in Europe and contribute to the implementation of the EU-US MoU and roadmap.
(ii) Proposals should investigate the possibility of combining existing or developing a new European or international standard which address the following issues:
         Unambiguous definition and description of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, including unique identification.
         Handling of substitution
Proposals should be submitted by a consortium composed of relevant international standards development organisations, member states' public authorities and fora and consortia which have a demonstrated expertise to perform the work.
Proposals should build on existing standard vocabularies, terminologies and ontologies and demonstrate a likely contribution to the adoption of existing, or the development of new international standards
(iii) Proposals should investigate the use of SNOMED CT as a core terminology to solve semantic interoperability issues for cross border but also national and regional eHealth deployments in the EU. Proposals should cover aspects such as costs (license or membership, but also operational, translations, mapping to local terminologies, maintenance, training,…), fitness to clinical requirements, legal, technical and operational, benefits, governance, impact on the different stakeholders including patients and healthcare providers, for the cross border as well as for the national and regional scenarios. Proposals should compare the SNOMED scenario with at least two scenarios: a) do nothing at the EU level and b) define a semantic interoperability framework without SNOMED CT. Proposals should assess whether SNOMED CT satisfies the criteria listed in the annex II of the EU standardization regulation. Proposals should take into account advice and guidelines from the eHealth Network but also developments related to the EU-US roadmap.
Proposals for section (iii) should have a duration of no longer than one year.
(iv) The proposal should build on existing work done by projects such as epSOS[2] and SemanticHealthNet[3] which will have developed key building blocks which will help to address the challenge. The epSOS pilot project has been piloting two basic use cases (ePrescription and Patient Summary) and successful proposals should identify and agree on a roadmap of use cases that should be deployed on large scale in the future after the epSOS use cases. Proposals should demonstrate the value proposition of healthcare providers with regard to interoperability and assess sustainable incitement schemes that would encourage healthcare providers to encode health data and provide it in an interoperable way and to invest in interoperable eHealth systems.
Proposals should gather a large multidisciplinary group of stakeholders from the Member States, Regions, SDO, sectoral fora and consortia, industry, health insurance companies, key interoperability experts, patients associations, health care providers associations, and any other stakeholders which will be deemed necessary. Proposals should deliver a full business plan going beyond 2020 including all revenue streams and cost items.

","Innovation action
","15 October 2015
","24 May 2016","Specific Challenge:
Advanced functional materials with customized thermal/electrical conductivity properties provide new opportunities in manufacturing.
The improved properties of sustainable advanced functional material with customized thermal/electrical conductivity properties will benefit end user industries in many sectors, Applications areas are wide ranging, and may include new manufacturing processes such as additive and 2D/3D printing processes and roll-to-roll or other large scale manufacturing processes.
The need for such materials, affordable, industrially robust and environmental friendly, calls for the upscaling of these widely researched materials and their manufacturing processes. This should ensure the further integration of the nano-enabled multifunctional materials into practical large-scale applications, and drastically exceed the current use in niche-markets.
Scope:
The proposed pilot lines should address the development, upscaling and demonstration in relevant industrial environments.
They should use existing pilot lines as a starting point for development, incorporating new materials and methods and/or instrumentation with real time characterization for measurement, analysis and monitoring at the nanoscale to characterise relevant materials, process properties and product features.
The aim is to increase the level of robustness and repeatability of such industrial processes; to optimise and evaluate the increased performance of production lines in terms of productivity and cost-effectiveness; and finally to assess the sustainability, functionality and performance of the produced new materials.
Proposals should address the complete research-development-innovation cycle and obstacles remaining for industrial application, and involve a number of relevant materials producers and users, also considering the needs of SMEs.
Technology transfer should be considered and prepared through technology services at affordable costs, facilitating the collaborating with EU SME and large industries, and the rapid deployment and commercialisation of the new technology.
Examples of possible applications include multifunctional composites and polymeric materials for applications such as sensors, integrated electronics, lighting protection, thermal layers, thermoelectric components including inks, high-voltage insulators, and providing anti-pollution, noise, thermal or anti-scratch properties and/or sensing, health assessment and self-healing functions, etc.
Non-technological aspects key for the marketing of such products (e.g. standardization, regulatory issues, user acceptance, HSE aspects, LCA) need to be considered.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6, and target Technology Readiness Level 7. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The improved properties of advanced functional material with customized thermal/electrical conductivity properties can benefit end user industries such as automotive, aerospace, consumer durables, electrical and electronics, safety, healthcare, and energy.
Enhanced manufacturing capacities in Europe and/or enhanced market opportunities for European enterprises. These impacts should be addressed in particular in the outline of the business case and exploitation strategy to be submitted with the proposal. The expected content of this outline is further detailed in the LEIT introduction, section 6.
Impact should be presented at three levels:
Impact on the consortium materials producers and users, and other involved industries, demonstrated in the form of reduced costs and full consideration of environmental and safety legislation,
Other existing or new materials manufacturers, describing the expected impact from further integration of the nano-enabled multifunctional materials into practical large-scale applications with producers outside the consortium,
Global impact in form of direct or derived benefits from competitive advantage of the new materials in products.
The impact will also be improved by a contribution to training and knowledge dissemination for building an educated workforce.
Overall the action is expected to help driving the demand in Europe as well as support the penetration of new markets worldwide. This should include clear benefits to manufacturers, including SMEs, and new entrants into the market should be expected.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The sustainability of pilot and demonstration solutions and services is broadly perceived as one of the biggest challenges in streamlining healthcare delivery processes and in improving cost efficiency while maintaining or improving patient safety. The pace of development has been slow and penetration of ICT still has high growth potential in healthcare compared to other public or private sectors.
This activity facilitates public purchasing of innovative solutions in healthcare which have not yet been deployed on a large scale.
Scope: The proposals should improve sustainable deployment of new or improved services by healthcare service procurers in line with the eHealth Action Plan[1]. Examples of target outcomes for healthcare delivery may include addressing early hospital discharge, delivery of healthcare in remote, sparsely populated and difficult to access regions, eHealth services for mobile EU patients, and pre/post operation care outside the hospital environment.
The scope of the PPI pilot(s) is to specify, purchase and deploy ICT based solutions which can deliver sustainable, new or improved healthcare services and improve the ecosystem in which procurement approaches for innovative healthcare solutions are successfully applied.
 Proposals should be driven by clearly identified procurement needs of healthcare organisations and provide for appropriate public engagement:
Solutions should be based on a complete set of common specifications for technology and end to end services;
The implementation phase should have the ambition to reach a large scale across multiple regions of Europe;
Proposals must engage public and/or private procurers from each country participating (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area of care or supply of services;
Wherever possible the work should build on and contribute to relevant standards to ensure interoperability and take into account best practices and relevant standardisation efforts as well as provide appropriate safeguards against relevant ethical and privacy issues;
The work shall include a non-confidential, comprehensive socio-economic evidence base for ICT investments in the field (including e.g. cost-benefit analysis, assessment of impacts, return on investments, medical evidence, patient safety gain and user satisfaction) to facilitate the development of sustainable business models and;
Good practice shall be made available for replication in other regions, for example detailed plans for larger-scale sustainable uptake as well as reference material including guidelines, manuals and educational materials.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
As applicable, contribution to regulatory and legal process development addressing possible barriers to procurement of innovative solutions in healthcare.
Growing awareness and successful use of public procurement by the procurers to boost innovation in the application of ICT in the sector concerned.
Support to interoperability and defragmentation of the market.
Sustainable implementation of services and creation of economic conditions that support long-term development.
More forward-looking, concerted, public sector approach to eHealth.
Reduced fragmentation of public sector demand across a number of EU Member - or Associated States by enabling public purchasers to collectively implement PPI strategies, which due to their nature are better addressed jointly, or which they would not have been able to tackle independently.
Increased opportunities for wide market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side for ICT based solutions and services by forming critical mass on the public demand side.

Target groups of this topic are professional organisations and other stakeholders, such as healthcare systems and institutions
Background and purpose of the call:
The proposed action should consider activities focused on the implementation of the EU guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials in human health, which were published by the Commission in June 2017[1]. These Guidelines aim to support a variety of key stakeholders and public health authorities in Member States in reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and combatting AMR. While the Guidelines have been well received further action is needed to facilitate and encourage stakeholders to take them forward and implement them.
The European One-health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance COM(2017)339
commits the Commission to engage with and support collaboration among key stakeholders in the human health, animal health, food, water and environmental sectors to encourage the responsible use of antimicrobials in the healthcare sector.
The levels and trends of resistant infections in the EU are still not yet improving. This action is thus urgent to engage stakeholders more actively as one of the contributions to reducing the spread of AMR, namely the need to ensure more prudent use of antibiotics and foster antibiotic stewardship.
Three out of the four key priorities of the Third EU Health Programme (2014-2020) are directly related to this action. The most relevant is the fourth priority on facilitating access to better and safer healthcare for citizens, which calls for ‘Measures to prevent antimicrobial resistance and control healthcare-associated infections’. Also relevant is the Programme priorities to ‘Contribute to innovative, efficient and sustainable health systems’ and ‘Protect citizens from serious cross-border health threats’.
The project(s) aims to involve European level stakeholders to promote, disseminate and directly apply the EU guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials in human health among the target groups identified in the guidelines, i.e., prescribers (e.g. doctors and hospital clinicians), pharmacists, nurses, infectious disease specialists and those responsible for the management of health systems.
This proposal is for incentive measures to combat serious cross border threats to health as set out in TFEU Article 168 and enabled via the EU Health Programme Regulation.
This project(s) will support chiefly the implementation of EU legislation, namely Decision (EU) 1082/2013, which includes actions to support and coordinate response on serious cross-border health threats including AMR.
The project(s) will contribute towards the key performance indicators of Directorate-General health and Food Safety, as set out in its Strategic Plan, namely to reduce antibiotic consumption in human health in the EU by 30% by 2020.
Objectives pursued and expected results:
The main objectives of the present call for projects (stakeholders actions) are focused on the implementation of the EU guidelines on prudent use of antimicrobials in human health:
to raise awareness and foster the direct application of the EU guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials by healthcare practitioners and members of the stakeholder organisations;
to change practices on antimicrobial prescription and dispensing amongst members of the stakeholder organisations involved (in the project) in the direction of compliance with the guidelines;
to reduce of inappropriate use of antimicrobials in human health.
Description of the activities to be funded under the call for proposals:
The activities should enable stakeholder organisations to take further action on AMR within the framework of the EU guidelines on prudent use of antimicrobials in human health. The action will engage with professional groups and settings which require specific attention and develop and implement packages of interventions to implement the guidelines adapted to the needs of the job roles and settings (e.g. hospital, primary care long term care) involved. Deliverables are expected to include adaptations of the guidelines to the local situation, training packages, clinical audit tools, evaluation tools, methods for assessing outcome indicators, tools and methods for providing positive and negative feedback to practitioners and incentive schemes.
The organisations intending to participate in a project should include, but are not restricted to professional associations and scientific societies relevant for the target groups identified in the guidelines – including prescribers (e.g. doctors and other clinicians), pharmacists, nurses, infectious disease specialists and those responsible for the management of health systems.
The amount is intended to either support either 1 large project with 20-30 partners or 2 or more smaller projects with 5-19 partners.
Project teams should include at least one European umbrella organisation covering a significant part of the health workforce. Ideally partner organisations should include several such organisations and also include partners in individual EU Member States and other countries participating in the EU 3rd Health Programme.
Expected impact:
The expected outputs are
Adaptation of guidelines to the local situation;
Trainings,
Workshops,
Clinical audit tools,
Evaluation tools,
Tools and methods for providing feedback to practitioners and incentive schemes.

Hepatitis B/C infection is a significant health burden in Europe. New treatment schemes are available which can ensure high cure rates. The objective of this action is to support EU Member States to improve access to hepatitis testing for those at risk and access to affordable high quality treatment with antivirals and to further specify appropriate prevention methods to prevent (re-)infections.
Scope:
The activities will support the development of national hepatitis strategies, screening and treatment guidelines, taking into account available treatment options. It will help to bridge primary, secondary care, and outreach, in the community including prison health services, to facilitate access to and uptake of testing, vaccination and treatment services particularly among key risk groups including drug users, prisoners, homeless, men who have sex with men, sex workers and people living with HIV/AIDS. It will also assess the potentially considerable economic impact of available treatment, testing strategies and vaccination options on health systems, which are under the responsibility of the EU Member States, with a view to inform decisions on balancing access to medicines and vaccines with the financial sustainability of health systems. They will build on work undertaken by the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality related to hepatitis B and C, and reducing new transmissions and the socioeconomic impact of hepatitis in the EU/EEA.

Background and purpose of the call:
Increased access to vaccination for newly arrived migrants in first line, transit and destination countries.
Objectives pursued and expected results:
The main objective of the call is to address cross-border threats produced by infectious diseases in order to reduce risks and mitigate their consequences.
The most efficient public health and primary prevention measure is vaccination. However, vaccine preventable diseases are not completely controlled in the EU as the vaccination coverage is not the adequate one in all countries and for all vaccines. Even if the coverage of 95% of the population -the one considered necessary for herd immunity- is achieved, it is not equally distributed in specific geographic areas and population groups.
Differences in access to health services, health literacy, provision of information, etcetera, can have an impact in the percentage of population vaccinated.
As demonstrated in recent health crisis, the level of health security of the EU is the one of the less prepared or most affected country. Infectious diseases do not have borders, and we need a high vaccination coverage in the whole EU, and specific focus on vulnerable population is required.
The Council Recommendation on strengthened cooperation against vaccine-preventable diseases[1] welcomes the Commission’s decision to identify barriers to access to vaccines and support interventions that increase access for disadvantaged and socially excluded groups, including by promoting health mediators and grassroots community networks, in line with national recommendations.
The objectives of the action are to:
support Member States to reduce the transmission and outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease by increasing vaccination uptake among newly arrived migrants
to close vaccination coverage gaps in newly arrived migrants, taking into account a life-course approach
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic:
Activities to increase access to vaccination of newly arrived migrants, thereby improving the uptake of both childhood and life-course vaccines in individuals;
Development, dissemination and implementation of systematic approaches for guidance on increasing access to vaccination;
Systematic check-ups of vaccination status of the populations concerned and follow up to comply with the national recommendations;
Activities aimed to increase health literacy of the concerned population and health professionals and health mediators taking care of them;
The project shall be implemented in at least 5 different eligible countries;
The target population shall be newly arrived migrants in first line, transit and destination countries
Projects shall address all ages and shall not only concentrate in a specific age group of the targeted population;
The projects shall aim to increase vaccination coverage, and shall only be focused in vaccine preventable diseases that are part of the official vaccination programmes approved by the national or regional authorities;
Activities funded under this topic shall not be exclusively based on research or a theoretical approach, but shall have an emphasis on implementation at country level. Projects that work exclusively on elaboration of guidelines, educational material or description of differences in vaccination status will not be considered as sufficient for this call.
The projects must be able to demonstrate the increase in the vaccination uptake of the targeted populations;

Background and purpose of the call:
Vaccination coverage has decreased in the EU in recent years. As a consequence, new outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases occur.
The Special 2019 Eurobarometer on attitudes towards vaccination shows that EU citizens largely trust the advice of health professionals in vaccination matters. However, health professionals need to receive updated training to be able to communicate accurate information to the public and to combat myths and exchange best practices.
The proposed action should support the Coalition for Vaccination, set up in 2019, to contribute to the implementation of the Council Recommendation on strengthened cooperation against vaccine-preventable diseases through activities such as:
improving access to accurate information about vaccination;
combating disinformation about vaccination;
increasing confidence in vaccines
improving uptake of vaccines;
training health professionals and students in vaccinology as well as in communication skills, taking the needs of disadvantages and vulnerable groups into account.
Ideally, project partners should include several Coalition Member Associations as well as other stakeholder organisations from EU Member States, EEA countries and other countries participating in the 3rd EU Health Programme, which are able to support implementation of relevant aspects of the Council Recommendation on strengthened cooperation against vaccine-preventable diseases.
Objectives pursued and expected results:
The main objectives are focused on the implementation of areas covered by the Council Recommendation:
deliver accurate and transparent information to patients, caretakers and the general public;
join efforts among Coalition Member Associations and other stakeholder organisations to increase confidence in and uptake of vaccines;
combat myths and disinformation related to vaccines, including via collaboration with media;
invest in education and communication and collaborate among the different stakeholder organisations.
Expected results:
Project outputs (products or services), which will make a difference in terms of how the safety and benefits of vaccines are communicated to patients, caretakers and the general public, and which have the ultimate goal of increasing the uptake of vaccines.
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic:
Actions funded under this topic shall include:
Training (and training of trainers) programmes for health professionals and/or students, e.g. to improve communication skills in view of addressing concerns about the safety and benefits of vaccines;
Workshops, regional dissemination meetings;
Awareness-raising campaigns, social and mainstream media activities;
Guidelines, information materials and other tools to support stakeholders to achieve the objectives.
Expected impact:
Strengthened efforts among Coalition Member Associations and other stakeholder organisations to increase confidence in and uptake of vaccines;
Disseminating accurate and transparent information to patients, caretakers and the general public;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Non-communicable chronic diseases have a major impact on the health of European citizens on the burden on health systems, and on the productivity of our societies. Contributing for decision makers in Member States to have the most up to date knowledge on best practices related to the reduction of such burden is thus most relevant to better support national health systems and EU citizens. Supporting the awareness, commitment and roll-out of initiatives that have shown to work is an essential way of creating and delivering value to the citizens.
Whereas a best practice cannot be replicated without adaptation and adjustment, the results, experience of ongoing and past initiatives always constitute a wealth of relevant knowledge. Taking them into consideration may allow to avoid mistakes or to leap frog painful development steps; ignoring them may result in huge wastes of time and resources, and of opportunities to improve public health.
Public health authorities should have access to the best scientific evidence base and to the expert evaluation of tried practices whenever considering disease prevention and management options. They should also have the opportunity to be briefed directly by those that have successfully led (past) initiatives and discuss, among others, pitfalls and success factors. Finally, they should be supported in the key steps of preparation of implementation so as to increase scope and likelihood of success.
Building on such information and support, and considering their national context and political priorities, Member States can then be in a better position to proceed with wide scale implementation of validated best practices and interventions. The stronger the commitment and the wider the roll-out, the more promising the results for the patients and citizens will be.
In order to support this process of promoting that more tested solutions benefit the citizen as fast and wide as possible, the Commission has set up the Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non Communicable Diseases This Group selects best practices for transfer between countries with the support of the 3rd Health Programme and other sources.
During a marketplace workshop in March 2018 the Danish Whole Grain Partnership (WGP) initiative was presented to Member States. Afterwards, several Member States have already expressed interest in wider rolling out of this practice and the Commission wishes to further support this process.
For that purpose, this call for proposals is being launched to facilitate the transfer of this best practice to other countries.
Topic 3 - Transferring the Danish Whole Grain Partnership initiative to other countries
The proposals should describe how the concept of WGP will be deployed in the participating Member States, including how the responsible authorities will be involved and their commitment secured with the objective of achieving the sustainable widest possible roll-out of the practice by the end of the action. The major parts of implementation should take place in a duration of up to 3 years.
Among others, the proposals should describe how actions will be taken to:
assess the preparedness and feasibility of (local, regional, national) health departments in selected countries for introducing WGP;
increase the awareness among policy-makers and health professionals of the importance of whole grain as a part of a diet to promote health and prevent diseases;
develop, adopt, translate and provide high quality implementation tools for WGP;
inform and educate food business operators to get their commitment to use more whole grain in their products (such as bread, pasta and rice) and to increase their offer of whole grain options, in the appropriate context (namely with the assurance - via the use of nutrition profiles or other effective action - that the initiative will not promote nutrionally unbalanced products);
implement local, regional or national activities for contextualised practice transfer;
monitor the implementation process and assess the outcome of the implementation of WGP;
design measures to assess and increase the sustainability of WGP after the implementation phase;
develop opportunities and supportive networks for capacity building between the participating countries and the EU.
Actions such as feasibility assessments or studies, legal checks, needs assessment (including training), cost estimations, preparation of replication manuals (including translations where necessary), study visits and twinning, workshops with stakeholders, etc., would be expected. Unless duly justified, it is expected that the public health authorities of at least the following countries will be involved: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Romania and Slovenia.
The proposals should describe and justify which indicators will be used to measure outcome (e.g.: increase in daily intake of whole grain, increase in use of whole grain in food products, increase in offer of whole grain options) and to monitor the implementation of the action and measure the success of transferring the best practice (e.g. number of committed food business operators; translation and validation of guidelines and tools). To complement the task of monitoring and evaluation, the selected proposal will be provided with an OECD guide to support the monitoring of the implementation of best practices in general and the design of indicators in particular. The OECD may also provide specific advice to this action on how to optimise the cost-effectiveness of the best practice and an economic analysis of its results."

Deadline date","Scope:
The project should develop a non-invasive environmental monitoring system via the collection of biweekly pollen samples during two beekeeping seasons by beekeepers from several countries (n= 5-6) in Europe (citizens’ science project). The countries will be chosen on the basis of the following criteria: existence of regional/national activities and scientists/technicians able to sample pollen in their country, at least one representative of each authorisation zone (Annex 1 of Regulation 1107/2009). This monitoring system should be easy to carry out and reproducible across Europe. In specific cases, fresh honey samples may be collected.
The project should develop a protocol, agreed between scientists and field practitioners, and following official methodological recommendations (i.e. the European Food Safety Authority HEALTHY-B, the EPILOBEE study). In doing so, the outcome of the project can be integrated in multiple stressor models linked with bee health and risk assessment in accordance with the relevant parts of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report on pollinators, pollination and food production3. Practitioners' work will be coordinated by scientists/technicians. Pollen and pesticide analyses will serve to establish the botanical origin and contamination of the samples, respectively.
The project should identify areas at risk for bee health by putting analytical data in a geospatial context, aiming to understand the possible sources and variability of both bee food and contaminants.
During the project analysis of samples, will screen for both authorised and non-authorised pesticide and veterinary products. Additionally, the fate of the colonies participating to the sampling will be surveyed to explore potential correlations with the parameters measured. The interpretation of the monitoring results will contribute to the evaluation of the implementation of European legislation in terms of pesticide application (sustainable use directive), pesticide authorisation and efficiency of agro-environmental and greening measures from the common agricultural policy. Evaluation of the results and methodology to assess whether they could be enlarged to wild pollinators.
The project should give an indication of the plant biodiversity of the landscape linked to the biology of honeybees throughout the year.
The project should perform a verification of the quality of the CORINE database (or other more detailed land use dataset available in the countries participating) for landscape-level exposure modelling."

Background and purpose of the call:
Mental health problems affect about 84 million people across the EU. This is more than one in every six citizens. The total costs of mental ill-health are estimated at more than 4% of GDP (more than EUR 600 billion) across the 27 EU Member States. Out of this, EUR 190 billion reflects direct spending on health care, EUR 170 billion is spent on social security programmes, and EUR 240 billion represents indirect costs to the labour market due to lower employment and productivity. In a dedicated chapter, the Health at A Glance: Europe 2018 report[1] stressed the need to improve and promote mental health, concluding, inter alia, that mental ill-health leads to lives lived less fully and to lives lost prematurely.
The Commission has undertaken and supported many actions on mental health over the past fifteen years. Taking the European Framework for Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing[2] (as the main outcome document of the EU Joint Action on Mental Health and Well-Being[3]) forward, the Commission created the EU Compass for Mental Health[4] to support implementation resulting in -for instance- good practice exchange and capacity building. The Compass' practices were since incorporated in DG SANTE’s 'Best Practice Portal'[5]. The Commission wishes to support the Member States in building on the expertise gathered and on the progress made over those years. Contributing for decision makers in Member States to have the most up to date knowledge on best practices is relevant to better support national health systems and EU citizens. Supporting the awareness, commitment and roll-out of initiatives that have shown to work is an essential way of creating and delivering value to the citizens.
Whereas a best practice cannot be replicated without adaptation and adjustment, the results, experience of ongoing and past initiatives always constitute a wealth of relevant knowledge. Taking them into consideration may allow to avoid mistakes or to leap frog painful development steps; ignoring them may result in huge wastes of time and resources, and of opportunities to improve public health.
The Steering Group on Promotion and Prevention and Management of Non-Communicable Diseases (SGPP) is the central mechanism to support Member States' health objectives, especially via implementation of best-in-class approaches. Late 2018, the Steering Group set mental health as a priority for the identification of best practices and implementable research[6]. Consequently, a selection of practices resulting from projects funded by the EU Health Programme or Horizon 2020 was showcased to Member States’ representatives at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra in May 2019[7]. By autumn 2019, Member States ranked these according to relevance to their national priorities and interest for implementation in their national settings.
Objectives pursued and expected results::
Through this call for proposals, the Commission now seeks to support the roll-out of those practices with the highest priority ranking and that require a strong involvement of non-governmental actors, notably:
European Alliance Against Depression[8] - iFightDepression
Housing First[9] Portugal (Casas Primeiro Portugal)
Actions under this topic shall transfer the best practice Housing First Portugal: The objective of Housing First is to provide integrated housing in the community for long-term homeless people with severe mental illness, in some cases combined with substance abuse. It has a service delivery approach or method fostering social inclusion and citizenship.
Activities of Housing First include intensive and direct support to the person in the household and the integration in local services in all areas, such as health, mental health, social welfare, and judicial services.
The intervention has achieved housing retention rates of up to 90%.
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic:
Actions funded under this topic shall transfer the above best practice to other Member States and embed it in their health systems. Actions shall include, among others:
assess the preparedness of local, regional, national entities and health services in the participating countries for introducing the above mental health best practice;
increase the awareness of the importance of mental health among policy-makers and health professionals;
develop, translate and provide high quality implementation tools for implementing above best practice;
train trainers and professionals in the core components of the best practice (adapted to the national context);
implement local, regional or national activities for contextualized practice transfer;
monitor the implementation process and assess the outcome of the implementation;
design measures to assess and increase the sustainability of the practice after the implementation phase;
develop opportunities and supportive networks for capacity building between the participating countries and the EU.
Promote the implementation to other EU Member States that are not participating in the project.
Actions such as feasibility assessments or studies, legal checks, need assessments (including training), cost estimations, preparation of replication manuals (including translations where necessary), definition of clinical protocols, setting up of e-learning tools, study visits and twinning, workshops with stakeholders, etc., should furthermore be included.
The proposals shall describe and justify which indicators will be used to measure outcome and to monitor the implementation of the action and measure the success of transferring the best practice. To complement the task of monitoring and evaluation, the selected proposal will be provided with the forthcoming OECD guide to support the monitoring of the implementation of best practices in general and the design of indicators in particular. The OECD may also provide specific advice to this action on how to optimise the cost-effectiveness of the best practice and an economic analysis of its results.
The projects funded under this topic are expected to liaise with the forthcoming Joint Action on Implementation of Best Practices on mental health of the work programme for 2020 of the Health Program, which will allow Member States’ health authorities to transfer further validated practices of high policy relevance.
The proposals are expected to build on the outcomes of the previous EU-funded work on mental health as well as on lessons learned on the transnational transfer of good practices, for instance via the Joint Action CHRODIS Plus[10] and other projects funded via the Health Programme that focus on good practice transfer[11].
This call for proposals shall involve entities, namely NGOs, that are responsible for development, stewardship and implementation of (mental) health practices on the ground, in direct contact with the citizens, also with regard to prevention. They can and should also involve national and regional health authorities when relevant.
Expected impact:
Activities under this call for proposals shall successfully transfer the above best practice to other Member States in a sustainable manner. In doing so, the actions contribute to:
supporting Members States in constantly improving the quality and sustainability of their health systems, especially through to improving information, expertise and the exchange of best practices [12], also building on the European Pillar of Social Rights[13];
supporting Member States in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 on reducing mortality caused by non-communicable diseases by 2030 through prevention and treatment including the promotion of mental health and well-being[14];
the invitation to Member States and the Commission ‘to implement evidence-based and effective policy interventions at national and Union level to address common challenges to wellbeing, in accordance with their respective competences’ as included in the Council Conclusions on the Economy of Wellbeing (adopted in October 2019)[15]. These Conclusions drew attention to the necessity of promoting good mental health and advancing prevention, early diagnosis, treatment and de-stigmatisation of mental disorders;

Priorities of the year, objectives poursued and expected results
Patient registries and databases constitute key instruments to develop clinical research in the field of rare diseases, to improve patient care and healthcare planning. They are the best way of pooling data to achieve a sufficient sample size for epidemiological and/or clinical research. Indeed, registries serve as a recruitment tool for the launch of studies focusing on disease etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis or therapy.
In the Council Recommendation of 8 June 2009 on an action in the field of rare diseases Member States committed themselves to consider supporting at all appropriate levels, including the EU level, for epidemiological purposes, registries and databases, whilst being aware of independent governance.
In order to support this process and in particular the interoperability of data in rare diseases registries the Commission decided to set up a European Platform on rare diseases registration.
As laid down in Article 12 of the Directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare registries will be a one of the objectives of the European Reference Networks to be set up. Therefore, only approved ERNs are eligible to be co-funded.
Description of the activities to be funded under a call for proposals
The activities to be carried out concern the creation of 3-4 new registries on rare diseases. These registries should constitute key instruments to increase knowledge on rare diseases and develop clinical research. Collaborative efforts to establish data collection and maintain them will be considered, provided that these resources are open and accessible. Registries should be built with the support and according to the standards set up by the European Platform on rare diseases registration and provide all necessary data to the Platform (taking the relevant data protection rules into account)."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Non-communicable chronic diseases have a major impact on the health of European citizens on the burden on health systems, and on the productivity of our societies. Contributing for decision makers in Member States to have the most up to date knowledge on best practices related to the reduction of such burden is thus most relevant to better support national health systems and EU citizens. Supporting the awareness, commitment and roll-out of initiatives that have shown to work is an essential way of creating and delivering value to the citizens.
Whereas a best practice cannot be replicated without adaptation and adjustment, the results, experience of ongoing and past initiatives always constitute a wealth of relevant knowledge. Taking them into consideration may allow to avoid mistakes or to leap frog painful development steps; ignoring them may result in huge wastes of time and resources, and of opportunities to improve public health.
Public health authorities should have access to the best scientific evidence base and to the expert evaluation of tried practices whenever considering disease prevention and management options. They should also have the opportunity to be briefed directly by those that have successfully led (past) initiatives and discuss, among others, pitfalls and success factors. Finally, they should be supported in the key steps of preparation of implementation so as to increase scope and likelihood of success.
Building on such information and support, and considering their national context and political priorities, Member States can then be in a better position to proceed with wide scale implementation of validated best practices and interventions. The stronger the commitment and the wider the roll-out, the more promising the results for the patients and citizens will be.
In order to support this process of promoting that more tested solutions benefit the citizen as fast and wide as possible, the Commission has set up the Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non Communicable Diseases This Group selects best practices for transfer between countries with the support of the 3rd Health Programme and other sources.
In this context, the SGPP has recently selected two relevant best practices for transfer from the ""owner"" to other Member States/countries participating in the 3rd Health Programme. These are the Swedish Prescription of Physical Activity (PPA) initiative which was identified as a particularly valuable one and has been replicated in Iceland already as well as the Italian cardiovascular screening programme ""CARDIO 50""
Several Member States have already expressed interest in discussing the rolling out of thses practices and the Commission wishes to further support this process.
For that purpose, this call for proposals is being launched and should facilitate the transfer of the two selected best practices to other countries.
Topic 2 - Transferring the Italian CARDIO 50 programme to other countries
The proposals should describe how (principle actions of) the CARDIO 50 programme will be deployed in (selected areas of the) participating Member States, including how the responsible authorities will be involved and their commitment secured with the objective of achieving the sustainable, widest possible roll-out of the practice by the end of the project. It is suggested that the project has a time span of up to 3 years.
Among others, the proposals should describe how actions will be taken to:
Provide a needs assessment and situation analysis;
Share/up-date the existing materials including for the target population as well as the health professionals involved;
Re-programme the existing IT tool to estimate the risk of the screened participants;
Pilot the CARDIO 50 programme in selected regions or cities;
Monitor and evaluate the activities;
Assess the key factors to ensure sustainability for the CARDIO 50 programmes and ensure that these are taken.
Actions such as feasibility or needs assessments, revision and translations of materials, preparation of the IT tool for use in other countries, concrete pilot testing in selected regions/cities, study visits, staff exchange and twinning, workshops with stakeholders, etc., would be expected.
Unless duly justified, it is expected that the public health authorities of at least the following countries will be involved: Italy, Croatia, France, Hungary, Lithuania and Luxembourg.
The proposals should describe and justify which indicators will be used to measure process and outcome (e.g. the satisfaction of the 50-years old population and the participating health professionals, the participation level of the invited adults, etc.) and to monitor the implementation of the action and measure the success of transferring the best practice (e.g. potential sustainability and institutionalization e.g. through inclusion of CARDIO 50 in a regional health strategy or plan). To complement the task of monitoring and evaluation, the selected proposal will be provided with an OECD guide to support the monitoring of the implementation of best practices in general and the design of indicators in particular. The OECD may also provide specific advice to this action on how to optimise the cost-effectiveness of the best practice and an economic analysis of its results."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Objective:
The particularity of paediatric cancers being rare diseases necessitates a collaborative approach to collate and integrate the data collected in all member states, including best practices and new technologies in order to further develop common solutions. The use of big data for better insights in cancer genesis, outcomes and the long-term side effects of treatments is currently under-developed.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are powerful tools allowing for complex data analytics on large-scale data sets with great potential for fostering precision cancer medicine for all young people in Europe. Further advances in the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric oncology will require multinational, multidisciplinary integrated healthcare and research data platforms that will allow real world data simulations of machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence that can be exploited in data-driven clinical decision support applications that directly benefit patients.
The project will create synergies and complement the activities under the pilot project funded from the previous call (PPPA-AIPC-2020) to support the development of multi-national approaches to facilitate capturing data on paediatric cancer from multiple sources, and build a multi-stakeholder network. It will have a particular focus on patients, survivors and carers as active contributors and participants in the co-creation and definition of user requirements and overall usability of applications of Artificial Intelligence technologies in paediatric cancer. The project will take into account and further complement the analysis of the challenges, needs and gaps in capturing data on paediatric cancer across EU/EEA countries produced by the pilot project funded under the previous call. It will further advance the framework to find solutions and prioritise opportunities to bridge existing gaps with a multi-national, multi-disciplinary approach, in particular with regard to user and stakeholder engagement. Mapping and building on existing multi-disciplinary and multi-national platforms/datasets and registries including the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform) the project will contribute to paving the road to a European point of access for integrated healthcare and research data platforms that collate clinical data, including, for example, clinical history, relevant diagnostic tests (pathology, genomics, radiological imaging), treatment interventions and clinical outcomes for childhood cancers. The project will contribute to a multi-stakeholder network to connect and facilitate the exchanges and dissemination of best practices in clinically relevant applications of machine-learning and artificial intelligence among all relevant stakeholders with a specific focus on user empowerment and feedback. The project should focus on multiple applications, for example radiological imaging, digital pathology, digital twins, integrated genotyping and outcome prediction algorithms and clinical decision-making. The project should consider the specificities of paediatric cancer, across types and stages of tumours.
Scope:
The European Commission adopted on 04 May 2021 a decision on on the financing of pilot projects and preparatory actions in the field of ""Communications Networks, Content and Technology"" and on the adoption of the work programme for 2021 (C(2021) 3006 final).
Paediatric cancers are a collection of diverse rare diseases that together represent individually life-threatening diseases and collectively a major public health issue. With 35,000 new cases and more than 6,000 children and young people dying each year in Europe, paediatric cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease for children and adolescents. Two-thirds of survivors live with the long-term treatment-related side effects that can be severe and impact on the daily life of half of those affected.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in is an important enabler of advancements in the field of health and care: it can unlock data insights needed to support data-driven decisions for diagnostics and treatments. In particular, AI has the potential to carry out complex tasks that are currently performed by specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. In this sense, AI technologies have the potential to ease the burden on the health system and improve access to healthcare (e.g. screening) in remote or low resource areas. AI may also play a role in training healthcare professionals.
Expected Impact:
The project will support research and innovation and further collaboration on artificial intelligence technologies applied for diagnosis and treatment of paediatric cancers. Project results are expected to cover a representative range of stakeholders and solutions across EU/EEA countries, with a particular focus on patients, carers and survivors. The project is expected to create synergies and complement the activities under the pilot project funded from the previous call (PPPA-AIPC-2020). The project should link to and collaborate with relevant stakeholder groups and EU initiatives (including the European Reference Network for Paediatric Oncology, ERN PaedCan and the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform)) and build on other EU-funded projects (for example, the Paediatric Rare Tumours Network – PARTNER project)."

","Grant agreement
","01 July 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Improving SMEs’ access to public procurement is an important objective for the European Commission. Inside the Union, the SMEs’ weight in above threshold procurement is still low when compared with their contribution to Gross Domestic Product (only 45% compared to 58%). The participation of SMEs in procurement across borders is even lower.
Public procurement offers major business opportunities to SMEs. In the Union, public procurement represents around EUR 2000 billion per year. When adding the opportunities outside the Union, the potential for growth is even higher. The World Trade Organisation Secretariat estimates the Government Procurement Agreement opportunities amount to US$ 1.7 trillion annually.
The participation of SMEs in public procurement is a win-win situation. It helps SMEs to grow and scale-up, it improves their reputation, and helps them to obtain more business in the private sector. For public authorities, it increases the number of offers the public buyers get, ultimately increasing the chances to obtain the best value for money.
This action will be implemented through a call for proposals. The projects shall take into consideration several aspects: the identification of the SMEs capacities to operate in an international environment, the sector specificities, and the knowledge and expertise related to certain non-Union partner countries, the knowledge about procurement markets. Therefore, this action will give flexibility to the organisations submitting the proposal to tailor their services to the needs of SMEs while achieving the objectives set in this action. The action could cover several measures such as awareness raising about opportunities existing outside the Union (tenders alerts and guides on what is specific to the respective country on public procurement), training and advisory services to SMEs, business- to-procurers events, partner-finding support, consortia building, etc. In the implementation of this action, the selected consortia should look for synergies with other projects/initiatives developed under COSME or other Union Programmes.
Scope:
The objective pursued is to improve SMEs’ access to public procurement in the non-Union countries with which the Union signed an agreement covering public procurement (for example, the Government Procurement Agreement of the World Trade Organisation, Stabilisation and Association Agreements, Free Trade Agreements, etc.).
Public procurement contributes to the growth and the global competitiveness of SMEs. The European Union has invested significant resources in negotiating these agreements in order for Union companies to be able to take advantage of the opportunities outside the Union. This action will focus particularly on the public procurement area and falls under the second specific objective of the COSME programme: access to markets.
The projects will have two stages:
1. A preparatory phase, where each project will be requested to develop an internationalisation strategy and its implementation roadmap, based on the targeted Member States and third countries, and
2. The implementation phase, to apply the internationalisation strategy.
In order to achieve the objectives of the action and to have, potentially, economies of scale, the grantees should cover at least three Member States and COSME participating countries. They should target at least two non-Union partner countries with which the Union has signed a trade agreement including a public procurement or are member of the Government Procurement Agreement of the World Trade Organisation.
Expected Impact:
The current action is designed to ultimately help SMEs to participate in public procurement outside the Union through co-financing actions of intermediate organisations supporting SMEs’ internationalisation and participation in public procurement. As a result, these organisations should develop their capacities to help SMEs in this respect, offer more targeted and better support. This measure should complement the efforts done by the EEN in this field and serve as a basis for a better understanding of the SMEs’ concrete needs and developing more precise tools.
Qualitative and quantitative indicators for the action:
1. Number of business intermediary organisations, clusters and other types of organisations from different COSME participating countries having benefited from the support actions (at least 3 per project).
2. Number of SMEs reached by these actions (per project, at least 300 SMEs from 3 Member States).
3. Number of information materials (webinars, interviews with successful companies, etc.) about non-Union countries (at least 3 per project).
4. Number of “meeting the procurers” events (at least 2 meetings organised per project).
5. Number of partner-matching actions (at least 2 per project).
6. Number of submissions of offers under international procurement procedures during the project.
7. Increase in the percentage of the turnover from international bids won and employment of the SMEs that directly or indirectly benefited from the project."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The general objective of the pilot project is to contribute to assessing the benefits of a broadband connectivity via satellite in areas impacted by digital divide with the support of regional or national public authorities, as a precursor of the even larger benefits that the European Gigabit Society will later make largely available.
In accordance with this objective, the entities allowed to participate in the call must have a clear experience in implementing space telecommunications technologies for the reduction of the digital divide and for connectivity improvement.
Accordingly, proposals shall help the Commission to achieve at least the following specific objectives:
Analysis of EU regions in long-term digital divide and impacted sectors and population notably for schools: the identification of some relevant regions, schools and other stakeholders must be in the proposals;
Assessment of simple, efficient and cost-effective implementation schemes (e.g. vouchers) to ensure easy access to satellite broadband connectivity: the proposals must present solutions ensuring easy access to satellite broadband connectivity;
Assessment, through deployment of broadband internet access via satellite to some unconnected schools (“field trials”), of the benefit of distribution via satellite of educational multimedia content relying, to the extent possible, on data and services offered by the Union space programmes; and
Development of outreach and communication activities.
Proposals shall describe how relevant European stakeholders in the ICT supply chain shall be involved through an inclusive process and which appropriate coordination with educational stakeholders (Ministries of Education, EU Commission, etc.) shall be established.
Applicants may find useful data and information for the preparation of their proposal by contacting NEREUS – Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies. As NEREUS is the unique European regions’ association spreading the use and understanding of space technologies, it could provide support to the pilot project while taking care of involving regions currently not members of NEREUS.
Within the limited scope of a pilot project, the overall expected outcomes of the pilot project are:
The assessment of the benefits of a broadband connectivity via satellite for a minimum of 10 schools across Europe in minimum of 3 different and a maximum of 5 different Member States and;
The assessment of other market sectors and identification of the related stakeholders that could potentially benefit from broadband connectivity via satellite in regions affected by digital divide.
The proposals shall take into consideration, in order to avoid any overlapping and exploit possible synergies, any other existing or planned initiatives (European, national, regional...) which are likely to meet the need of broadband connectivity improvement of the schools chosen to be connected."

","13 July 2021","ExpectedOutcome:
This action is to provide an impulse to the purchase of innovative solutions in the Union and spreading of good procurement practices with a growing number of buyers. The dissemination of information on how to procure innovation or the lessons learnt in the process was very broad. The key requirements of the call enabling this achievement should be the setting up of a dedicated website and the participation in specific fora of public buyers.
Qualitative and quantitative indicators for the action:
- Number of companies involved in the joint market consultation(s) carried out;
- Number of buyers involved in a joint commitment to purchase;
- Number of joint specifications developed;
- Number of suppliers involved in the procurement (at consultation stage, at award stage, etc.) and out of which proportion of SMEs;
- Number of countries of suppliers involved in the procurement at the different stages;
- Direct procurement amount;
- Indirect procurement amount (after the end of the action, but still linked to the action);
- Contribution of procured solutions to the public policy objectives, to be measured by indicators proposed by the applicant and validated by EASME and the Commission.
- Relevant sustainability indicator(s) (depending on the nature of the innovation e.g. CO2 emissions).
Scope:
Description of activities:
To continue developing public procurement of innovation (PPI) consortia and increase the impact of previous actions, it is proposed to continue the co-financing programme under COSME started in 2018 for consortia of public buyers.
SMEs already represent around 55% of the public procurement expenditure. Nevertheless, this proportion can be significantly increased if public buyers take steps to ease the access of SMEs. One of the areas with the highest potential is innovation procurement, where SMEs enjoy a privileged position as innovation suppliers. Experience in the area under previous co-financing programmes shows that SMEs are much more likely to be involved as suppliers of innovation than as suppliers of conventional products and services.
Recently, in its Guidance on innovation procurement the Commission highlighted the benefits of public procurement of innovation, in particular on SMEs and start-ups and the scaling-up of activities. This Guidance provides practical information and examples. It complements the previous Communication Europe’s next leaders: the start-up and scale-up initiative, where procurement was also mentioned as a key instrument for supporting SMEs and Start-ups. As a result, a new call for proposals in the field of PPI will further increase in significant proportions the access of SMEs to the public procurement market. This call is also likely to increase the visibility and awareness of the advantages of procuring innovation for an ever-greater number of public buyers.
This action fulfils a gap in COSME, as it is one of the very few targeting demand-side in the context of a generally supply-oriented programme. It is closely linked to another action proposed under COSME with the same general objective, called the “innovation broker“.
In this context, a second call for proposals for setting up consortia of public buyers from at least two Member States would be launched. Public buyers from participating countries could also participate in the consortia. The call will be targeting priority areas like health, clean energy, smart city or intelligent transport. At the same time, such an approach gives the possibility to take into account the lessons learnt from the previous call to feed them into this call.
The actions should typically last for 3 to 4 years.
The co-financing would cover the following phases of PPI:
- Assessment of their needs by public buyers;
- Capacity Building and coordination between buyers (e.g. training, exchanges secondment of personnel);
- Market consultation (supporting the process of dialogue with potential contractors to assess the state-of-the-art and technological limitations for potential innovative solutions);
- Specification development (supporting contracting authorities to articulate their needs in a way that ensures the best response from potential contractors);
- Definition and implementation of award criteria;
- Co-financing of purchasing costs;
- Communication to the outside on the achievements of the projects."

Deadline date","Scope:
Comparative tests carried out in several Member States indicated that certain products, which are sold under the same brand and with the same or very similar packaging, have a different composition or characteristics across Member States.
Furthermore, the Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), in close collaboration with the industry concerned, developed and implemented a common testing methodology to ensure that investigations on dual quality issues can be based on sound evidence.
In order to complement the activities of the competent national authorities in identifying and countering potentially misleading branding strategies, it is of utmost importance to further develop the capacities of consumer organisations, including in the area of comparative product testing.
The present call for proposals under the pilot project “Limiting dual quality and strengthening consumer organisations in the EU”, therefore, aims at strengthening the role of consumer organisations in relation to testing and comparing basic consumption products, both in the national and cross-border context, and at identifying potentially misleading branding strategies or misleading information provided on the packaging, including in relation to dual quality.
The empowerment of consumer organisations is also a key element of the future Single Market Programme and, at the same time, will facilitate the implementation of the New Deal for Consumers legislative package, once adopted by the co-legislators.
The target group will be consumers and consumer organisations in the European Union.
The specific objectives of the call for proposals are:
To enable consumer organisations: (i) to test and compare basic food and non-food consumption products in relation to the issue of dual quality following sound methodological practices; (ii) to disseminate the test results, both in the national and cross-border context;
To achieve an effective implementation of the ‘Framework for selecting and testing of food products to assess quality related characteristics: EU harmonised testing methodology’, presented by the Commission’s Joint Research Centre on 25 April 2018, at national level;
To develop and implement sound methods for testing and comparing non-food products;
To identify potentially misleading branding strategies or potentially misleading information provided on the packaging, and to create tools for reporting them in all relevant instances, in order to maximise consumer protection;
To exchange best practices and to facilitate cross-border cooperation between consumer organisations and/or competent authorities and relevant private players and to improve consumer organisations’ advocacy policies in the above priority areas.
Priorities and activities to be co-financed
Within one or more of the above described objectives, the following activities can be funded:
Training of consumer organisations to develop or enhance testing expertise;
Exchange of good practices and knowledge-sharing events and/or seminars;
Set up or improvement of networks of consumer organisations involved in testing and/or other measures;
Development and rolling out of testing and comparison pilot projects in line with sound methodological principles, such as in particular the common methodology developed by the Joint Research Centre for testing of food products;
Awareness raising and/or advocacy activities among consumer organisations, public authorities, stakeholders and/or the public at large;
Development of IT tools to report on dual quality products or misleading branding information;
Activities to support the implementation of the ‘Framework for selecting and testing of food products to assess quality related characteristics: EU harmonised testing methodology’, presented by the Commission’s Joint Research Centre on 25 April 2018, at national level.
Expected results
Individual consumer organisations reinforce their capacities to test and compare basic food and non-food consumption products in relation to dual quality and are capable to disseminate the test results in line with sound methodological principles;
Consumer organisations are able to identify potentially misleading branding strategies including for example the provision of potentially misleading information on the packaging;
Existing national and cross-border networks of consumer organisations involved in the above areas are reinforced and new ones are set up;
The number and efficiency of national and cross-border partnerships between consumer organisations and other players, including public authorities and private sector, are increased, exchange of best practices between them improved;
More and better information and data also coming from monitoring and reporting activities are made available to better assess past/existing national policies, and design new ones."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
This call for proposals will support capacity building on rights of the child and child protection for professionals working for and with children in migration. The aim of the call is to ensure better protection and respect for the rights of all children in migration on EU territory through capacity-building for family-based care for unaccompanied children (Priority 1) and through building capacity and cooperation mechanisms for guardians whose role is to safeguard the rights of children in migration (Priority 2). Proposals shall complement the efforts of the EU in the area of rights of the child and child protection, and support the work on integrated child protection systems. To this end, proposals should be carried out in line with the 10 Principles for integrated child protection systems, and proposals should describe how their project implements the principles. This call does not aim to support operating costs.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
Proposals that do not address one of the two priorities of this call will not be considered.
This call will fund activities on:
Priority 1.This priority aims to expand the national systems of family-based care, such as foster care, for children in migration, as provided for in Article 24 of Directive 2013/33/EU laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection. Projects should support capacity-building for practitioners/professionals working with or for children in migration to increase the provision of quality family-based care to host unaccompanied children. This could include activities to attract and/or improve the quality of further capacity for quality family-based care (such as foster family care or small family-type units), adapt foster care standards to the situation of unaccompanied children, recruitment, training, monitoring and supervision activities for future foster parents, overcoming any barriers in the way reception funds are allocated (e.g. where funds are currently ring-fenced to be allocated solely to reception centres) as well as professionals working in the guardianship system. Account should be taken of previous EU funded projects on family-based care for unaccompanied children. Projects should also seek to address known gaps, such as the limited availability of family-based care, challenges in recruitment and monitoring foster parents, the need to train more foster parents, and the gaps for transition to adulthood in preparations for ageing out of care of unaccompanied children (e.g. independent living arrangements for older children and/or those that are aged out). Proposals are expected to boost child protection system changes and result in improvements that are sustained and sustainable after EU funding ends. This will require that project activities are integrated (and/or linked) within the national child protection systems and in particular alternative care systems.
Priority 2: Capacity-building and cooperation mechanisms for guardians whose role is to safeguard the rights of unaccompanied and separated children in migration (including development, piloting and delivery of training and accreditation taking account of the FRA Handbook on guardians and the FRA report on guardianship). This priority can include activities relating to the development, piloting and delivery of recruitment, training and accreditation of guardians taking account of the joint FRA/Commission Handbook on guardians and the FRA report on guardianship, with the objective of strengthening the role of guardian in the protection of children and clarification of the guardian's tasks in safeguarding the bests interests of the child, promoting the child's safety and well-being, facilitating child participation, acting as a link between the child and others, helping identify a durable solution in the best interests of the child, exercising legal representation and supporting the child in administrative or judicial procedures). Joint training activities could be envisaged to contribute to strengthening cooperation among guardians, foster-care professionals, child protection, judicial, migration and asylum authorities to enhance the protection of children, including at crossborder level. This priority can also cover activities that strengthen cross-border cooperation and exchange, for instance through the setting up of direct contacts with counterparts in other EU Member States, in the context of Dublin transfers and family reunification. The work of the European Network of Guardianship Institutions (ENGI, www.engi.eu) should be taken into account by applicants.
This call does not aim to fund projects addressing principally:
information to children on rights of the child
general awareness-raising on rights of the child
research on rights of the child
child victims, or violence against children (can be funded under other areas of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, such as Daphne's topic for action grants to support integrated and multidisciplinary child-centred approaches to child victims of violence, REC-RDAP-CHIL-AG-2016).
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impact on the lives of unaccompanied and separated children in the context of migration. All projects should not only develop a sound methodology using recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but consist of a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes, ultimately to improve children's experience of the child protection systems. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries (children), and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for children. This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposal should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. Any training modules developed should be made available and be easily adaptable for use in all EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
Given the challenges and known gaps in transnational cooperation and coordination, all proposals submitted under this call should describe how their project would enhance interagency and multidisciplinary cooperation and collaboration, both at national and transnational levels, to ensure the closer involvement of state child care and child protection authorities (national, regional, and/or local) for all children in migration situations, involving international organisations and non-governmental organisations where appropriate, to ensure a child-centred and child-rights based approach. For both priorities, the involvement of national (and/or regional and/or local if decentralised) authorities, or other entities mandated by the State, is essential. The range of actors proposed for each participating State must be appropriate in terms of the project objectives and activities. See Section 2.1.2 Eligibility of the application for more details
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate and be aligned with Article 24 of the Charter, relevant EU law and the UN Convention on the rights of the child. The child's right to be heard, as set out in UNCRC Article 12 and General Comment No 12, must be an integral part of all project activities.
Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project, for example in designing and reviewing responses to reports and actual cases of child victims, in reviewing services, in assessing what needs to be changed at system level, in empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them and in empowering children and young people to help themselves and other children, etc. Are there possibilities to involve children in project design prior to submission of proposals? Are the views of children on issues addressed in the call (possibly gathered elsewhere) reflected in the proposal?
Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priority
Projects shall support capacity building of professionals working for and with children in rights of the child and child protection. Project activities shall focus on putting in place robust national or regional mechanisms to support children ageing out of/leaving alternative care and they should encompass a strong child participation component (in project conception, design and implementation: agency, empowerment and resilience of children/the child’s right to be heard/children’s involvement in reviewing service delivery).
1.2. Description of the activities
Project activities may include:
mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation;
design and implementation of protocols, development of working methods which may be transferable to other regions or countries;
capacity-building and training for professionals;
EU funding is not intended to cover operational or running costs, but to support the development of robust and sustainable mechanisms and frameworks for children in alternative care, to support their ageing out of/leaving care. EU funding is intended to provide an opportunity to get the necessary stakeholders to work together and establish an integrated approach that ensures better outcomes for careleavers. Children in families can generally rely on family support over relatively long periods as they move, often in a non-linear manner, into young adulthood. ‘Corporate’ or ‘State’ parents should have commensurate support mechanisms in place for children in care. This call also covers third-country national/migrant children (including unaccompanied children) who are in the care of the State. Children may be in care as a direct result of neglect, abuse and violence and aftercare supports should arguably be even more extensive, as evidenced by the fact that lack of support may lead to a high proportion of young careleavers ending up homeless/in poverty/in conflict with the law, etc. In Europe, supports generally need to be increased. Children in care and careleavers are often stigmatised. Siblings may have been separated. Projects should be practical projects fostering capacity-building and an integrated approach, the exchange of good practice, training on the rights and needs of careleavers (possibly involving former careleavers themselves in training, but at the very least taking account of their experience in designing training) and provide for the monitoring and review of aftercare plans, the continuous review of efforts resulting from this project and monitoring of outcomes. Given the target group, all projects would benefit from the involvement and taking account of the experience of careleavers themselves.
Projects should describe how they will contribute to the implementation of the 10 principles for integrated child protection systems (see bibliography).
Projects should be aligned with the UN Guidelines for the alternative care of children and Moving forward: implementing the guidelines for the alternative care of children (Focus 12). Proposals will be assessed against alignment with these two documents under the relevance criterion with a particular focus on individualised planning and the direct involvement and empowerment of the child/careleaver her or himself.
Projects should seek to address known gaps in policy and in service provision both in preparations for leaving care and for aftercare supports such as: a stronger focus by corporate and State parents on ensuring that children in care have a positive experience of education and the monitoring of educational outcomes all through alternative care, life skills/preparation for (semi)-independent living, addressing gaps in the child’s knowledge of their life history, therapeutic services, out-of-hours social services, housing, education, training and labour market integration services, promotion of positive sibling relationships and peer support services. There should be a very clear focus on inclusive services and community involvement that also take account also of minority groups, children with disabilities and third-country nationals in alternative care. For third-country nationals, status determination procedures may need to be addressed and the child’s status resolved in a timely manner as a matter of routine and an integral part of an integrated approach. ‘One-stop-shop’ or otherwise integrated models of support for careleavers could be explored. Social enterprise models and a corporate social responsibility focus on alternative careleavers could also be usefully explored as part of an integrated approach.

and http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/closed-calls/index_en.htm
The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with the priority. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission or referred to below (see bibliography). The degree of relevance to the priority of the call for proposals will be assessed under the relevance award criterion.
All projects must take a rights-based approach and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC). Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts on the lives of beneficiaries (i.e. future careleavers). The projects should be practical projects rather than research and should include a combination of elements to form a coherent whole. All projects should not only develop a sound methodology using recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but consist of a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits, positive outcomes and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries, and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for the beneficiaries. This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposal should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For national projects, we expect projects to be coherent and address the situation of all future careleavers in state care (see 1.1 and 1.2). For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
All projects under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players, such as child protection agencies, careleavers’ associations, ministries/authorities for children or social affairs, social protection, children’s ombudspersons, services responsible for: housing, labour market integration, higher education and vocational training (including scholarships and grants), health and mental health, counselling and psychosocial support; civil society organisations, the judiciary, social workers, academia, etc. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players. Good quality cooperation among partners will be instrumental in making innovative projects successful. Regardless of whether projects are national or transnational in nature, they should aim to produce results that create or contribute to implementation of minimum standards at European level, or that could be transferable to other Member States.
At least one public authority from each participating country must either be involved in the project (as applicant or co-applicant) or by providing substantial support, e.g. Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services), Ministries for children, child protection, social services, social protection, labour market integration, education, health and mental health services, social affairs, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, etc). The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project description and implementation. In practical terms, it means that if, for instance, a transnational project is submitted by a partnership involving four different eligible countries, at least four public authorities as described above (one per each eligible country) must either be involved in the project as applicant or partner(s) or express in writing its support of the application. In the latter case, this support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application. The requirement will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate and be aligned with Article 24 of the Charter, relevant EU law and the UN Convention on the rights of the child. The child's right to be heard, as set out in UNCRC Article 12 and General Comment No 12, must be an integral part of all project activities. The involvement of careleavers themselves is strongly recommended; including in project design. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project, for example in designing and reviewing responses to reports and actual cases of child victims, in reviewing services, in complaint mechanisms, in assessing what needs to be changed at system level, in empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them and in empowering children and young people to help themselves and other children, etc. Are there possibilities to involve children in project design prior to submission of proposals? Are the views of children on issues addressed in the call (possibly gathered elsewhere) reflected in the proposal? Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast (see bibliography).
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the beneficiaries of funding (including partners) need to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy if they will be working directly with children. However, given the subject matter of this call, for all projects, child safeguarding must be central to project design and implementation. The applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to (see Annex 4 of the Guide for applicants). A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in ""Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them"" issued by Keeping Children Safe (see bibliography). The quality of the applicant’s child safeguarding/protection policy will be assessed under award criterion b) quality.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. Applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. We expect all projects to address and systemise the monitoring of outcomes for future careleavers. Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability, including through the involvement of the relevant authorities in the project itself, and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).
1.3. Expected results
all children in state or corporate care are better supported in preparing to leave care;
support and preparation measures start well before children age out/leave care and are individualised;
known gaps at national level are better addressed;
ageing out of care systems are joined up, coherent and integrated and designed to ensure that all children who are care leavers have a strong support network and do not fall through cracks;
careleavers’ access to essential services, higher education, vocational training and the labour market is improved;
outcomes for children in care/careleavers are monitored;
good practice is collected and shared (also across borders) with a view to being replicated;
project activities reflect and contribute to practical implementation of the 10 principles for integrated child protection systems;
practices and methods live on after project end.

Topic description
The Council of Europe Guidelines on child friendly justice (see bibliography) define child friendly justice as a justice system which guarantees the respect and the effective implementation of all children’s rights at the highest attainable level, is accessible, age appropriate, speedy, diligent, adapted to and focused on the needs and the rights of the child. It respects the rights of the child including the rights to due process, the rights to participate in and to understand the proceedings, the rights to respect of private and family life and the rights to integrity and dignity.
Access to justice and especially child friendly justice is not a given. Progress has been made in many countries and areas, but there are still many challenges: testimonies of children (especially children with disabilities) are often not taken into account, children are put under a lot of pressure when appearing before the court, they are interviewed multiple times and by professionals without appropriate training, violence against children is still under detected, under reported and under prosecuted, etc.
The European Commission adopted the Victims’ rights directive (Directive 2012/29/EU) and Directive (EU) 2016/800 on the procedural safeguards for children who are suspects or accused in criminal proceedings.
Child victims are considered to have special protection needs under the Victims` rights directive. A number of measures to protect child victims such as use of video recording for their testimonies or appointment of a special representative in case of conflict of interest between them and their parents should always be available to child victims. Other measures should be adopted, taking into account an individual assessment of their needs in order to ensure that if a child victim has to take part in criminal proceedings, every effort should be made to avoid causing further trauma as a result of interviews or visual contact with offenders.
Directive (EU) 2016/800 specifies that children who are suspects or accused in criminal proceedings shall be individually assessed. The individual assessment shall, in particular, take into account the child's personality and maturity, the child's economic, social and family background, and any specific vulnerabilities that the child may have.
Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
As an integral part of the child-friendly justice system, in full cooperation with practitioners and designated authorities in the national justice system(s) concerned:
1. To systemise and further roll out evidence-based supports to children involved in criminal, civil or administrative judicial proceedings.
2. Capacity-building for judicial and other practitioners/professionals involved in systemising robust, multidisciplinary individual assessments under Article 22 of Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime and Article 7 of Directive (EU) 2016/800 on procedural safeguards for children who are suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings, taking account of the Member States which transposed/are due to transpose these Directives.
2. Description of the activities
Under the first priority, activities shall include steps to systemise and roll out the use of accredited intermediaries, communication aids or toolkits on supports for children before, during and after judicial proceedings and/or capacity building and communication aids for lawyers/legal advisers/support persons for children. For some examples see the report from the conference on child friendly justice which took place in June 218.
Under the second priority, activities shall include capacity building for judicial and other practitioners/professionals directly involved in the multidisciplinary individual assessments.
Activities must take place in countries participating in the REC Programme to be eligible for funding.
Support of public authority
It is strongly encouraged to involve a public authority, including regional and local authorities, to be actively involved in the projects. This will be assessed under the award criterion (b) quality of the proposed action. These public authorities can be: Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services), Ministries for children, child protection, social services, social protection, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, etc. The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project description and implementation. This support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application and will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project foresees direct contact with children, every beneficiary of funding (including partners) needs to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy (not a cumulative one per consortium). The applicant and all partners must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to.
A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas (for more information please see “Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them” https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en_1.pdf):
policy: how the organisation is committed to preventing, protecting and responding to harm to children
people: clear responsibilities and expectations on its staff and associates and supports them to understand and act in line with these
procedures: the organisation creates a child-safe environment through implementing child safeguarding procedures that are applied across the organisation
accountability: the organisation monitors and reviews its safeguarding measures. What are the mechanisms in place within the organisation.
A child protection policy should include clear information about the recruitment of all staff – including trainees and volunteers, including background checks (vetting).
A child protection policy must include clear procedures and rules to staff, including reporting rules, and continuous training on this should be in place.
The child protection policy should be available online, i.e. transparent to all those who come in contact with the organisation.
The child protection policy document is to be submitted as Annex 4 and will be assessed under the operational capacity criteria.
3. Expected results
Projects should foster capacity-building, the exchange of good practice, training on the rights and needs of children involved in judicial proceedings, while taking full account of the experience of children and young people who went and go through such experiences. We expect all projects to address and systemise the monitoring of outcomes for children involved in judicial proceedings.
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts on the experiences of beneficiaries (i.e. children involved in judicial proceedings). Activities should focus on the target group and aim at making the system work better for children: the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, their need should be solidly justified and they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
Proposals including development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools, should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
Applicants are invited to take note of previously funded projects (see bibliography). The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with the priority. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Priority 1. To systemise and further roll out evidence-based supports to children
children do not suffer further or secondary traumatisation as a result of their involvement in judicial proceedings;
judicial and other practitioners are more aware of the evidence-based supports that could and should be provided to children;
systemised individual assessments are conducted as required under EU law;
children are better supported in judicial proceedings including in giving best evidence;
the rights of the child are promoted and better protected before, during and after judicial proceedings;
outcomes for children are improved;
Member States are supported in implementing child-friendly justice processes and procedures;
the rights of the child are better respected and implemented in the justice system.
Priority 2. Capacity-building for judicial and other practitioners
judicial and other practitioners are better equipped to communicate with children;
Member States are supported in implementing child-friendly justice processes and procedures;
multidisciplinary and interagency cooperation among the relevant national and other designated authorities is facilitated;
the rights of the child are better respected and implemented in the justice system.
All projects must take a rights-based approach[1] and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC). Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.
Child participation
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate[2] and all project activities must clearly integrate and protect the child's right to be heard[3].The involvement of children who were or are involved in judicial proceedings themselves is expected; including in project design. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project: in designing training and protocols, developing working methods, reviewing services, establishing complaint mechanisms, assessing what needs to be changed at system level, empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them, etc.[4]
Geographical scope and partnership
All projects under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players[5]. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players.
The involvement of public authorities[6] (at national or local level) is a clear asset to the proposal (as applicant or partner or by providing support). The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project description and implementation. This support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application and will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability, including through the involvement of the relevant authorities in the project itself, and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
Projects shall support capacity building of professionals working for and with children on the rights of the child and child protection: project activities shall focus on putting in place robust national or regional integrated mechanisms to support children ageing out of/leaving alternative care and they shall encompass a strong child participation component (in project conception and design/empowerment of children/the child’s right to be heard/children’s involvement in reviewing service delivery).
2. Description of the activities
Project activities may include:
mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation;
design and implementation of protocols, development of working methods which may be transferable to other regions or countries;
capacity-building and training (train the trainer);
EU funding is not intended to cover operational or running costs, but to support the development of integrated, coherent and robust mechanisms and frameworks for children in alternative care, to support their ageing out of care. As the focus is on national or regional integrated mechanisms, projects are expected to be inclusive in nature, covering all children in state or corporate care. Children in families can generally rely on family support over relatively long periods and “corporate” or “state” parents should have commensurate support mechanisms in place for children in care. As part of an approach fostering an integrated approach to children in state care, this call can also cover third-country national/migrant children (including unaccompanied children) who are in the care of the State. Children may be in care as a direct result of neglect, abuse and violence and aftercare supports should arguably be even more extensive, as evidenced by the fact that lack of support may lead to a high proportion of young careleavers ending up homeless/in poverty/in conflict with the law, etc. In Europe, supports generally need to be increased. Children in care and careleavers are often stigmatised. Siblings may have been separated. Project applications must demonstrate the close involvement in all project phases of those working directly with children in care. Thus, it is expected that applicants and partners include in the first instance organisations and actors responsible for and working with and for children in care. Projects should be practical projects fostering capacity-building and an integrated approach, the exchange of good practice, training on the rights and needs of careleavers (taking full account of the experience of former careleavers, e.g. by involving them in training, and at the very least taking account of their experience in designing training) and provide for the monitoring and review of aftercare plans, the continuous review of efforts resulting from this project and monitoring of outcomes. Given the target group, all projects are expected to involve and take account of the experience of careleavers themselves.
Projects should describe how they will contribute to the implementation of the 10 principles for integrated child protection systems (see bibliography).
Projects should be aligned with the UN Guidelines for the alternative care of children and Moving forward: implementing the guidelines for the alternative care of children (Focus 12). Proposals will be assessed against alignment with these two documents under the relevance criterion with a particular focus on individualised planning and the direct involvement and empowerment of the child/careleaver her or himself.
Projects should seek to address known gaps in policy and in service provision both in preparations for leaving care and for aftercare supports such as: a stronger focus by corporate and State parents on ensuring that children in care have a positive experience of education and the monitoring of educational outcomes all through alternative care, life skills/preparation for (semi)-independent living, addressing gaps in the child’s knowledge of their life history, therapeutic services, out-of-hours social services, housing, education, training and labour market integration services, promotion of positive sibling relationships and peer support services. We expect all projects to address and systemise the monitoring of outcomes for future careleavers. There should be a very clear focus on inclusive services and community involvement that also take account of minority groups, children with disabilities and third-country nationals in alternative care. For third-country nationals, status determination procedures may need to be addressed and the child’s status resolved in a timely manner as a matter of routine and an integral part of an integrated approach. ‘One-stop-shop’ or otherwise integrated models of support for careleavers could be explored. Social enterprise models and a corporate social responsibility focus on alternative careleavers could also be usefully explored as part of an integrated approach.
Applicants are invited to take note of previously funded projects (see bibliography).
The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with the priority. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission or referred to below (see bibliography). The degree of relevance to the priority of the call for proposals will be assessed under the relevance award criterion.
All projects must take a rights-based approach (for projects relevant to children, see child rights approach definition: paragraph 59 of General Comment No 13 of the UN Committee on the rights of the child) and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC). Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts on the lives of beneficiaries (i.e. future careleavers). The projects should be practical projects rather than research and should include a combination of elements to form a coherent whole. All projects should not only develop a sound methodology using recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models, but consist of a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits, positive outcomes and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries, and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for the beneficiaries (future careleavers). This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposal should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For national projects, we expect projects to be coherent and address the situation of all future careleavers in state care whether they are e.g. deprived of parental care, children with disabilities or third country national children. For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
All projects under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players, in particular those working for and directly with children in alternative care and child protection agencies, careleavers’ associations, ministries/authorities for children or social affairs, social protection, children’s ombudspersons, services responsible for: housing, labour market integration, higher education and vocational training (including scholarships and grants), health and mental health, counselling and psychosocial support; civil society organisations, the judiciary, social workers, academia, etc. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players. Good quality cooperation among partners will be instrumental in making innovative projects successful. Regardless of whether projects are national or transnational in nature, they should aim to produce results that create or contribute to implementation of minimum standards at European level, or that could be transferable to other Member States.
One public authority per participating country must be actively involved in the projects, as applicant or partner or by providing support , e.g. Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services), Ministries for children, child protection, social services, social protection, labour market integration, education, health and mental health services, social affairs, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, etc). The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project description and implementation. In practical terms, it means that if, for instance, a transnational project is submitted by a partnership involving four different eligible countries, at least four public authorities as described above (one per each eligible country) must either be involved in the project as applicant or partner(s) or express in writing its support of the application. In the latter case, this support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application. The requirement will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate and be aligned with Article 24 of the Charter, relevant EU law and the UN Convention on the rights of the child. The child's right to be heard, as set out in UNCRC Article 12 and General Comment No 12, must be an integral part of all project activities. The involvement of careleavers and future careleavers themselves is expected; including in project design. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project, in designing training, in designing protocols and development of working methods, in reviewing services, in complaint mechanisms, in assessing what needs to be changed at system level, in empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them and in empowering children and young people to help themselves and other children, etc. Are there possibilities to involve children in project design prior to submission of proposals? Are the views of children on issues addressed in the call (possibly gathered elsewhere) reflected in the proposal? Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast (see bibliography).
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the beneficiaries of funding (including partners) need to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy if they will be working directly with children. However, given the subject matter of this call, for all projects, child safeguarding must be central to project design and implementation. The applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to (see Annex 4 of the Guide for applicants). A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in ""Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them"" issued by Keeping Children Safe (see bibliography). The quality of the applicant’s child safeguarding/protection policy will be assessed under award criterion b) quality.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report 2013), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. Applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability, including through the involvement of the relevant authorities in the project itself, and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
Priority 1. The actions aim to enhance and develop citizenship of the Union
More specifically to: promote awareness, gather data and build knowledge concerning EU citizenship rights and associated European common values and common democratic standards; foster the inclusion and provision of information to mobile EU citizens and their family members; encourage democratic participation of mobile EU citizens and under-represented groups, including women, Roma, young people and citizens with a disability. The actions should support the efforts of Member States and civil society organisations in this domain, complementing and not duplicating the work being funded elsewhere by the Commission.
Priority 2. Restricted to public authorities, the actions aim to support national cooperation networks responsible for bringing together the national authorities and bodies involved in elections (such as in their organisation, and in the monitoring and enforcement of legislation)
The overall purpose is to support the integrity of free and fair elections in Europe, preserving the democratic institutions and citizens’ participation in them. Coordination within and among such networks could lead in particular to the establishment of common working methods to detect and address threats to elections (potentially setting up alert systems), best practices and guidelines.
2. Description of the activities
Whereas several measures and initiatives are listed, it is not requested to include all of them in a single project. Projects with a strong focus are very much valued.
Priority 1. To enhance and develop citizenship of the Union, promote awareness of EU citizenship rights, Union values and democratic standards, gather data and build knowledge concerning EU citizenship rights and foster inclusion and provision of information to mobile EU citizens and their family members and encourage democratic participation of mobile EU citizens and under-represented groups.
Activities may consists of projects; training; seminars; awareness-raising practices; data gathering and consultation, development, exchanges and dissemination of best practices amongst public authorities and civil society organisations. This could involve in particular:
data-gathering and consultation on the way EU citizenship rights are used, on how to build knowledge of these rights and on how such rights might be enhanced and developed;
ways of fostering engagement in the democratic life of the European Union (through e.g. facilitation of access to cross-border and local political information, and the promotion of common democratic standards and awareness of the European dimension in politics) and representation as well as participation in local and EU elections, including of young people, women and EU citizens living in another EU country than their own (through e.g. digital, interactive, innovative tools);
inclusion policies and best practices which do not solely focus on one profile of mobile EU citizens, but rather take into account both the different needs of these EU citizens and their family members as well as the challenges cities are facing when welcoming them (e.g. housing, schooling, inclusion in the job market, involvement in community decision-making and volunteering etc.), and which promote multiculturalism;
dissemination of practical information and advice on what the rights of EU citizens and their family members are, including voting rights, residence rights and responsibilities of mobile EU citizens in a given country/region/city and assistance in seeing them through.
Indicative amount: € 1.000.000
Priority 2. Restricted to public authorities: to support national electoral cooperation networks and a European coordination of these networks
Activities may consist of workshops, seminars, conferences, expert meetings at various levels as appropriate (high level meetings may be needed to coordinate on policy approaches, while technical exchanges among experts may be needed to implement such policies); mutual learning, the development of tools or guides, cooperation exercises; analytical studies; awareness raising activities, as well as information exchange platforms.
Furthermore, actions may include creating fora for sharing expertise among the national authorities to monitor and explore challenges and detect threats, to monitor enforcement and administrative practices and to identify gaps in existing frameworks, including cross-border implications, and to raise awareness among stakeholders and citizens. Actions could also provide for national contact points to enable an efficient and effective exchange of good practices among Member States and coordination at the European level.
Indicative amount: € 1.000.000
Activities must take place in countries participating to the REC Programme to be eligible for funding.
3. Expected results
Whereas numerous results are listed below, it is not expected for a single project to produce all of them. Projects bringing limited, but effective results are very much valued.
Priority 1. To enhance and develop citizenship of the Union:
improved information on the way EU citizenship rights are used and how they are implemented in Member States;
raised awareness and better provision of information to mobile EU citizens and their family members on their EU citizenship rights with resulting better knowledge of EU rights and conditions;
improved availability, awareness and participation of mobile EU citizens in civic activities in their host communities, such as volunteering groups and decision making bodies, including school boards and community organisations;
increased capacity of national, regional and local experts to enable and facilitate the participation of mobile EU citizens and their family members in the political and social life of their host communities;
strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent public authorities in relation to enabling mobile EU citizens' participation in their host Member States and local communities.
Priority 2. Restricted to public authorities: to support national electoral cooperation networks and a European coordination of these networks:
improved monitoring and understanding of electoral processes, including risks and challenges, and the regulatory framework, for preserving the integrity of democratic elections in Europe;
increased capability and awareness of authorities and relevant bodies involved in elections of their respective roles and responsibilities in this domain and their better collaboration.
streamlined and effective European level coordination in electoral matters."

NB: Selected projects will form part of the focused actions on violence against women that the Commission will implement in 2017. Selected projects may be expected to integrate visuals and messages developed by the Commission in this context. Project leaders should be ready to present or showcase their activities and results at events during this year or through the Commission's social media and press activities.
1.1. Priorities
For the purpose of this call, gender-based violence is defined as violence directed against a person because of that person's gender (including gender identity/expression) or as violence that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately.
As part of its work to combat gender-based violence, the Commission aims to prevent its incidence, encourage reporting and protect and support victims. The aim of this call is to contribute to education and awareness-raising to prevent and combat gender-based violence, in particular by changing attitudes and behaviours towards the phenomenon. Such education and awareness-raising should focus on providing girls and boys (under 18 years old) with information and skills related to gender equality, healthy relationships, gender stereotypes and roles, respect for others etc. Such initiatives should encourage critical thinking, so girls and boys challenge social norms that contribute to perpetuating gender-based violence. They should empower young people to claim their rights and to protect themselves in risky or violent situations, while ensuring that this does not only put the responsibility on the victim and contribute to victim-blaming. Awareness-raising and education aimed at encouraging bystander intervention is also welcome.
Awareness-raising and education activities can cover all forms of gender-based violence or focus on specific forms, such as female genital mutilation, forced marriage, or target particular groups who are vulnerable to such violence, such as LGBTI, ethnic or religious minorities, migrants etc.
Proposals shall complement the efforts of the EU in combating gender-based violence. Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will cover one or more of the following activities:
Education and awareness-raising activities, such as campaigns, exhibitions, workshops;
Capacity-building and training for professionals and volunteers who come into contact with girls and boys and who are or will be involved in education to end gender-based violence, including teachers and teacher educators, peer mentors, school counsellors, sports coaches, youth leaders, organisers of extra-curricular activities and similar professionals and volunteers.
Activities can be carried out in formal and informal education or other contexts. Applicants should reflect on the framing of messages and the use of specific messengers (such as youth leaders, local celebrities, sports coaches etc.) when developing such awareness-raising and education activities. Pre-testing of messages among the target group is strongly encouraged. Multi-component campaigns, combining different methods of awareness-raising and education, are particularly encouraged.
Activities endorsing or reinforcing gender stereotypes or gender norms that are harmful, justify gender-based violence and contribute to victim-blaming will not be funded. Any messages, images or materials developed in the context of this call should be sensitive, challenge gender stereotypes (for instance, avoid representing women as passive victims and all men as perpetrators) and should in no way stigmatise victims or any specific group.
The following types of activities will not be funded by the Commission:
- activities supporting individual political parties;
- provision of financial support to third parties;
- legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives;
- mapping of best practices or best practice guides/guidelines;
- the establishment of shelters or other infrastructure
- descriptive research reviews..
Although the continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives may be funded, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Child protection
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to. A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in ""Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them"" issued by Keeping Children Safe (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/files/rights_child/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en.pdf).
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate, as codified in Article 24 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as reinforcing and respecting the child's right to be heard throughout all project activities, where possible, and with the necessary safeguards in place, project design should involve children who are service users. Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast. Her models have, for example, been included in Ireland's National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in Decision-Making 2015-2020.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. This should go beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and assess how activities and the use of deliverables have led to attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group, e.g. there is lower tolerance of gender-based violence and the target group states they are more likely to intervene when witnessing it, or when witnessing a situation that could lead to gender-based violence, young people are aware of what constitutes respectful behaviour in relationships, the target group uses learned techniques in their daily life, etc.. Whenever possible, evaluations should encompass evidence on changes in both attitudes and behaviours, as a change in attitudes might not necessarily lead to a change in behaviour. When gathering evidence on attitudes, the evaluator should reflect on the possible effects of social desirability (i.e. the possibility that respondents do not state a particular opinion if they know that this opinion is not socially accepted).
Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. It should provide reliable results on ""what works"" and ""what does not work"" (for further details please refer to ""Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers"", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion). Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons/professionals/parents/teachers/volunteers/children reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by gender and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results."

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
This call for proposals will focus on the following priorities:
Priority 1. To increase general awareness and knowledge, including among children, of children rights and in particular, but not limited to, the right to be heard and express their voices on issues that matter to them.
Priority 2. To design, test, establish and evaluate mechanisms of child participation at local level.
Priority 3. To assess national legislative and policy frameworks for child participation, with a view to designing and implementing tools to promote child participation at national level.
2. Description of the activities
Under the first priority, activities shall include:
public campaigns promoting children’s rights in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the rights of the child, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights;
trainings and the production of training material for professionals as well as child friendly material on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child;
activities with children to increase their knowledge on their rights and what their rights mean in the European Union context.
For all the above, projects can aim at reaching children, parents, families, teachers, professionals who work in contact with children and youth, media, politicians and decision makers. Activities can take place in, inter alia, schools, youth clubs, community centres, child care facilities, health care facilities, reception facilities, the justice system, etc.
Proposals are encouraged to use, disseminate and build on already existing materials promoting children’s rights.
Under the second priority, activities shall include :
the design, implementation and evaluation of child participation mechanisms at local level, for example, children city councils, children advisory boards, and consultations with children;
peer learning and peer support among local authorities from the same or a different country, aimed at fostering exchange of knowledge and good practices on how to embed child participation in local decision-making processes.
Under this second priority, it is strongly encouraged to involve a public authority to actively participate in the projects. This will be assessed under the award criterion (b) quality of the proposed action.
Under the third priority, activities shall include:
mapping of existing national legislation and practice to assess how child participation is embedded in national frameworks;
development of strategies and plans to foster child participation at national level, as well as of handbooks, check-lists, training material, to build capacity on child participation;
design and implementation of child participation mechanisms at national level.
Under this third priority, it is strongly encouraged to involve a public authority to actively participate in the projects. This will be assessed under the award criterion (b) quality of the proposed action.
3. Expected results
increased awareness on and general knowledge of children rights, and their practical implementation, among the general population, professionals working with children, and children themselves;
increased space provided by local authorities for children to make their voice heard on issues that matter to them, as well as increased capacity to take children’s opinion into account in local decision making process;
strengthened knowledge and expertise on how to embed child participation in decision making at local and national level – throughout the whole participaiton process (listening to; following-up; and proving feedback);
enhanced inclusive, meaningful and imptacful child participation at local and national level.
Support of public authority
It is strongly encouraged to involve a public authority, including regional and local authorities, to actively participate in the projects. This support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application and will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
These public authorities can be: Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children rights/ child protection (social services, social protection, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, municipalities etc. The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project description and implementation.
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project foresees direct contact with children, every beneficiary of funding (including partners) needs to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy (not a cumulative one per consortium).
A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas (for more information please see “Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them” https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en_1.pdf):
policy: how the organisation is committed to preventing, protecting and responding to harm to children
people: clear responsibilities and expectations on its staff and associates and supports them to understand and act in line with these
procedures: the organisation creates a child-safe environment through implementing child safeguarding procedures that are applied across the organisation
accountability: the organisation monitors and reviews its safeguarding measures. What are the mechanisms in place within the organisation.
A child protection policy must include clear information about the recruitment of all staff – including trainees and volunteers, including background checks (vetting).
A child protection policy must include clear procedures and rules to staff, including reporting rules, and continuous training on this should be in place.
The child protection policy should be available online, i.e. transparent to all those who come in contact with the organisation.
The child protection policy document is to be submitted as Annex 4 and will be assessed under the operational capacity criteria.
Child participation
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate[1] and all project activities must clearly integrate and protect the child's right to be heard[2]. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral in every stage of the project’s design, implementation and evaluation.
Geographical scope and partnership
All projects under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability, including through the involvement of the relevant authorities in the project itself, and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

1.1. Priorities
This call for proposals will support projects promoting Union citizenship policies, in particular facilitating the exercise of the right to free movement and the electoral rights deriving from Union citizenship. The priority of the call will be to foster the successful inclusion and participation of EU citizens in their host EU country, and its civic and political life.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will fund activities on developing, identifying and promoting the exchange and dissemination of best practices implemented across the EU at local/regional/national level to foster the successful inclusion and participation of EU citizens in their host EU country, and its civic and political life (e.g. through one-stop-shop information services addressed to newcomers.)
Priority will be given to activities aimed at enhancing awareness of EU citizens of their rights, including the right to free movement, to increase their involvement in their host EU country and strengthen their ability to enforce these rights effectively.
Priority will be also given to proposals which seek to increase participation of EU citizens, with a focus on mobile EU citizens, in the democratic process, and particularly to those proposals which seek to address the reasons for the persistently low voter turnout, and to foster awareness of and promote the right to participate in European and local elections in the host country, thus strengthening the European dimension of these elections."

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The aim is to support Member States' efforts to address challenges arising from intra-EU mobility whilst also promoting and facilitating the effective exercise of the free movement rights by EU citizens and their family members. Project activities should foster the successful inclusion and participation of mobile EU citizens and their family members in the host EU country's civic and political life and their participation in the democratic life of the EU, particularly with a view to the 2019 European elections. Action grants will complement the work the Commission is funding in this domain following the publication of the 2017 Citizenship report, and of the work being funded through the European Parliament's pilot projects on e-voting and e-democracy.
1.2. Description of the activities
Development, exchanges and dissemination of best practices amongst national/regional/local authorities and civil society organisations. Support understanding of relevant national/regional/local rules and their interaction with EU citizenship rights. Directly support the participation of mobile EU citizens through information and advice. This could involve in particular (NB. The list is indicative and focusses on the intended outcome of the projects):
inclusion policies / best practices which do not solely focus on one profile of EU mobile citizens but take into account both the different needs of these EU citizens as well as the challenges big/smaller cities, are facing when welcoming EU mobile citizens (e.g. housing, schooling, inclusion to the job market, involvement in community decision-making and volunteering etc.) and which promote multiculturalism.
ways of fostering and supporting engagement in public debate (including through e.g. access to cross-border political information and facilitation of access to local political information) and participation in local and EU elections, including of young people and EU citizens living in another EU country than their own. This can be achieved through digital, interactive, innovative tools and / or best practices (debates, campaigns, initiatives, information, events, administrative practice etc.).
best practices / toolkits for newly arriving EU mobile citizens and their families, including on helping them settle down, find a job/training, participate in democratic life in the local community and create links in/with the local community.
dissemination of practical information and advice on what are the rights, including voting rights, and responsibilities of EU mobile citizens in a given country/region/city and assistance in seeing them through.
1.3. Expected results
increased capacity of national, regional and local experts to enable and facilitate the participation of mobile EU citizens in their host Member State;
increased capacity of national, regional and local experts to promote and welcome EU mobile citizens;
strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent national, regional and local authorities in relation to enabling mobile EU citizens' participation in the host MS, including in democratic life (e.g. voting and standing as candidates) and challenges related thereto (e.g. eliminating dual voting);
improved knowledge on the legislation and administrative practices related to enabling democratic participation for mobile EU citizens;
alignment of the administrative practices in relation to the applicable EU rules in different Member States;
improvement in the information provided to support the participation of EU citizens in the political and social life of their host communities."

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
1.1 Prevention of gender-based violence (GBV): The focus of this priority is on primary prevention, in particular changing social norms and behaviour, in order to end tolerance of all forms of gender-based violence. This includes concrete and practical activities to tackle prejudices and gender stereotypes, norms, attitudes and behaviours that encourage, condone or minimise violence, as well as to arm women and men with the tools to call out and stand up to violence through empowerment and bystander intervention programmes. Actions could include, but are not limited to education and training. Any form of gender-based violence can be covered under this priority, including specific forms, such as harmful practices. Proposals must explain which social norms, attitudes and behaviours they aim to address, and how, and justify how activities, encouraging or discouraging these attitudes and behaviours, will contribute directly to the prevention of gender-based violence.
(Indicative amount: € 2 900 000)
1.2 Protection and support for victims and witnesses of domestic violence, including through tackling under-reporting, promoting multi-disciplinary cooperation, and capacity building for relevant professionals. This involves the strengthening of child-centred and/or gender-specific responses to domestic violence (including child victims/witnesses of domestic violence), through capacity-building and multi-disciplinary strengthened cooperation and coordination among relevant actors, such as child protection and law enforcement professionals. Projects involving organisations and authorities working directly with the relevant target groups, with an empowerment/child participation focus, will be welcome. Projects that seek to address known gaps in protection and support for victims and witnesses of domestic violence (e.g. such as where responses/shelters/activities/therapeutic services may not cater to children of all ages, exclude older children, innovative approaches to empower victims, etc.) will be welcome (see example of business start up support for women victims of domestic violence).
This call aims to contribute to the implementation of:
- the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention), particularly Chapters IV and V related to support and protection measures, (including the provisions on child victims/witnesses);
- Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime.
(Indicative amount: € 2 900 000)
1.3 The coordination and/or adaptation of support services for sexual and gender-based violence to include refugees and migrants (children, women, LGBTI persons, men and boys), in particular to ensure their recovery from such trauma. The aim is not to create new, separate or parallel services but to adapt existing services in an inclusive manner. This call will not fund operating or running costs, but is intended to build capacity and adapt frameworks to include people in migration, for example where outreach to new facilities and structures are needed or where the involvement of cultural/health mediators/interpreters could help.
(Indicative amount: € 2 400 000)
1.4 Prevention and responding to cyber sexual- and gender-based violence (targeting children, women, LGBTI persons, men and boys), such as revenge porn, extortion with the use of sexual imagery (""sextortion""), sexual or gendered online harassment/bullying, grooming, etc. This involves capacity-building for relevant professionals, awareness-raising with the general public, education and empowerment for (potential) victims in claiming their rights, as well as tackling prejudices and gender stereotypes and norms that encourage or condone violence.
(Indicative amount: € 2 400 000)
1.5 Promoting the embedding of child safeguarding policies across different settings and sectors, such as sports clubs and organisations, extra-curricular activities and/or leisure/recreation clubs/organisations for children (including faith/church-led; scouts and girl guides, private schools), both as a means to protect and safeguard children as well as to equip staff with the necessary training and guidance. This covers activities such as the adoption and formalisation of appropriate child safeguarding and child protection policies, protocols and frameworks, capacity-building of professionals on child protection, and awareness-raising of existing standards, in line with the standards of the ""Keeping Children Safe - Child Safeguarding Standards and how to implement them"" guidance. Activities could also include practical application of Keeping Children Safe standards to specific settings.
(Indicative amount: € 2 700 000)
2. Description of the activities
Project activities may include:
For all priorities:
mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation
design and implementation of protocols, development of working methods which may be transferable to other regions or countries
capacity building and training for professionals
awareness-raising and education activities
Given the challenges and known gaps in national as well as transnational cooperation and coordination, all proposals submitted under call priorities, 2, 3 and 5, should describe how their project would enhance interagency and multidisciplinary cooperation and collaboration, both at national and at transnational levels (e.g. in planning for dealing with cases with cross-border aspects), including across governmental departments, to ensure the closer involvement of relevant authorities, in cooperation with other actors (e.g. civil society, academia, practitioners, etc.).
For priority 5, we recommend the Keeping Children Safe standards. There is also a self-audit tool on the Keeping Children Safe website. Bearing in mind that for any allegations of child sexual abuse or exploitation, law enforcement should be involved, we would expect to see a good range of relevant stakeholders involved, including those to whom reporting would take place (e.g. child protection authorities/police/child helplines/implementation of vetting checks prior to recruitment; consultation of the European Criminal Records Information System). The starting point(s) and the rationale for project choices must be clearly described.
For priorities 1, 2, 3 and 4, projects are welcome to focus on specific forms of violence or particular groups of victims, e.g. child-centred, or services for women or for men. Proposals should include justification for these choices, which will be assessed under the award criterion ‘a) relevance’.
This call does not aim to fund projects in the areas of:
conformity assessments of the transposition of Directive on the rights of victims of crime (2012/29/EU) into national law;
The following types of activities will not be funded by the Commission:
activities supporting individual political parties
provision of financial support to third parties
legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives.
***
Applicants are invited to take note of previously funded projects.[1] The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling-up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with one of the priorities. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission or referred to below (see bibliography). The degree of relevance to the priorities of the call for proposals will be assessed under the award criterion ‘a) relevance’.
For projects in the area of violence against children, projects must take a child rights-based approach and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC).[2] Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to and/or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts on the lives of beneficiaries. Research activities are not excluded, but the accent is put on the practical side and projects should include a combination of elements to form a coherent whole. While the projects should build on evidence of what works (e.g., from previous available research), they should have an applied nature and lead to practical applications. We expect the project components to form a coherent whole clearly linked to objectives and better outcomes for end beneficiaries (e.g. if you will apply child safeguarding standards to a specific setting, we also want to see that those working in the setting are involved and will take ownership of and implement the standards. All projects should not only develop a sound methodology using recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but consist of a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits, positive outcomes and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries, and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. All applications should describe how access to the selected target group(s) will be assured, considering, where appropriate, whether it is useful to ground activities to a place/geographical space also, e.g. school, workplace, kindergarten, museums, city, etc. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
For all priorities, applicants are encouraged – wherever possible – to apply insights and practical tools from behavioural sciences in their projects,[3] in view of achieving changes in attitudes and behaviour. Below is a step-by-step approach to guide applicants in the incorporation of behavioural insights in their projects. For illustrative purposes, the examples below refer to gender-based violence, though the same reasoning could apply to other issues.
1) First, applicants should provide a clear description of the issue that will be tackled by the proposed action. If we consider gender-based violence, the description should specify the type(s) of violence (for example physical, emotional), its characteristics (for example prevalence, severity) and the concrete context(s) (for example university, workplace, household) that will be covered by the proposed action. Additionally, the objective(s) of the action should be clearly defined. These should be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely (SMART) and should be set ahead of the action.
2) Second, the proposed action should identify the underlying determinants (also called behavioural causes) [Further details can be found in Section 3 'Understanding the causes of target behaviour' Sara Rafael Almeida, Joana Sousa Lourenço, Dessart François Jacques, and Emanuele Ciriolo. Insights from behavioural sciences to prevent and combat violence against women. Literature review (2016) pp. 8-13 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/insights-behavioural-sciences-prevent-and-combat-violence-against-women-literature-review] of the issue at stake. This could be, for example, passive stance of bystanders, low reporting of violence by victims. As the issues identified under point 1 likely have multiple underlying determinants, the proposed action could focus on several of these, or on only one. Each of the different underlying determinants the projects aims to tackle should be clearly indicated in the proposal.
3) Third, the proposed action should encourage a specific target group(s) to perform target behaviour(s) [Further details on potential target groups, subgroups and behaviours to be targeted by actions can be found in Section 2 'Identifying the target group and target behaviour' Sara Rafael Almeida, Joana Sousa Lourenço, Dessart François Jacques, and Emanuele Ciriolo. Insights from behavioural sciences to prevent and combat violence against women. Literature review (2016) pp. 7-8 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/insights-behavioural-sciences-prevent-and-combat-violence-against-women-literature-review] or discourage them from doing so. Actions may aim, for instance, at encouraging victims of violence to report the incidences of violence to the relevant authorities and/or to seek help in dedicated shelters; aim at changing ways of working of professionals to make it easier to report incidences of violence; aim at motivating journalists to avoid stereotypes by changing the way they report on and portray violence against women; or aim at changing men's perception of traditional gender roles, which support the acceptability of violence against women, etc.
4) Fourth, once the target group(s), the underlying determinants and the target behaviour are identified, applicants should describe the solutions [Further details on behavioural solutions can be found in Section 4.3.1. 'Content of the message: behavioural levers' Sara Rafael Almeida, Joana Sousa Lourenço, Dessart François Jacques, and Emanuele Ciriolo. Insights from behavioural sciences to prevent and combat violence against women. Literature review (2016) pp. 16-25 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/insights-behavioural-sciences-prevent-and-combat-violence-against-women-literature-review] (also called behavioural levers) that will be implemented. For example, if the proposed action aims at reducing the social acceptance of gender-based violence, the project could focus on changing social norms (ifor example, signalling the appropriate behaviour by comparing an individual’s conduct with that of the majority of his /her peers/neighbours/friends), or make use of so-called ""commitment devices"" (convincing the target group to make a public pledge to carry out a certain behaviour/ support the target group in developing a specific plan to achieve a certain goal) as part of the intervention.
5) Fifth, the proposed action should specify the outcome that the proposed solution aims at generating and how the outcome(s) will be measured. Outcomes refer to impact, change in attitudes or behavioural change resulting from the action, and should not be confused with project outputs (e.g. number of leaflets published, number of people reached). If possible, projects should propose a measurable objective, compared to a baseline. For example, if the goal is to increase reporting of violence, a valuable outcome measure would be the number of cases reported to the police following the implementation of the project. If the goal is to change attitudes of a certain group of professionals, projects should not only measure how many attended training, but also ask them about their attitudes before and after the training. All interventions should include collection of relevant data, to be able to compare the situation before and after the project.
6) Sixth, to find out whether the proposed actions will have the desired effects, ideally the project should include a phase of pre-testing the solutions before implementing them in full-scale [Further details on qualitative and quantitative pretesting methods can be found in Section 5 'Pretesting the initiative' Sara Rafael Almeida, Joana Sousa Lourenço, Dessart François Jacques, and Emanuele Ciriolo. Insights from behavioural sciences to prevent and combat violence against women. Literature review (2016) pp. 25-28 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/insights-behavioural-sciences-prevent-and-combat-violence-against-women-literature-review]. Such ex-ante assessment of the expected effect of the intervention will provide valuable insights on whether the proposed action has the intended effects and helps to ensure that, once fully deployed, the action focus is on what works. One possibility would be to use a randomised controlled trial..[In case quantitative pretesting using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is carried out, this phase includes the identification of the most feasible randomisation unit (i.e., individual or group). For example, the initiative could be delivered in all universities of Region A (the treatment group), keeping the curriculum of universities of Region B (the control group) unchanged (randomisation at the group level). The inclusion of a control group and the use of randomisation allow the comparison of the outcome of in Region A against the outcome in Region B, hence determining whether the intervention was effective, all other things being equal. See « Test, Learn, Adapt » (UK BIT, 2012) for more information on this approach.]
7) Seventh, the proposed action should include an evaluation of impact. Such evaluation should be part of the initial project plan, to make sure that the most appropriate evaluation design is used, and to set up valid outcomes measures (together with robust and feasible metrics) that allow the actual impact of the action to be determined. Several evaluation methods can be used such as after-only designs, before-after or pre-post designs, RCTs and field experiments. [Further details on evaluation methods can be found in Section 6 'Evaluating the impact of the initiative' Sara Rafael Almeida, Joana Sousa Lourenço, Dessart François Jacques, and Emanuele Ciriolo. Insights from behavioural sciences to prevent and combat violence against women. Literature review (2016) pp. 28-33 https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur-scientific-and-technical-research-reports/insights-behavioural-sciences-prevent-and-combat-violence-against-women-literature-review].
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for the beneficiaries. This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposals should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
All projects for each of the priorities under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players, such as child protection agencies, police, health services, the judiciary, victim support organisations, helplines, refugee, migrant and asylum seeker services, social workers, etc. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players. Good quality cooperation among partners will be instrumental in making innovative projects successful. Regardless of whether projects are national or transnational in nature, they should aim to produce results that create or contribute to implementation of standards at European level, or that could be transferable to other Member States.
At least one public authority from each participating country must either be involved in the project (as applicant or co-applicant) or by providing substantial support. For projects related to gender-based violence, these public authorities can be national, regional or local Ministries/agencies/equality bodies responsible for gender equality and/or provision of services to victims of violence or perpetrators; police, judicial, health or education authorities etc., as relevant. For projects related to children, these public authorities can be Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services, national guardianship institutions, Ministries for children, child protection, education, health, social affairs, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, law enforcement authorities etc). The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project Description and Implementation. In practical terms, it means that if, for instance, a transnational project is submitted by a partnership involving four different eligible countries, at least four public authorities as described above (one per each eligible country) must either be involved in the project as applicant or partner(s) or express in writing their support of the application. In the latter case, this support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application. The requirement will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
Mainstreaming
Projects funded under this call shall also seek to promote equality between women and men and the rights of the child. Gender and rights of the child mainstreaming means integrating a gender and rights of the child perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a project, as appropriate. Consequently, when relevant, the applicant shall take the necessary steps to ensure that gender equality and child-related issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men and of children. It is, for example, essential that projects do not silence, stereotype, stigmatise, lay the blame on or discriminate against women or men. Projects should contribute to empowering women and to ensuring that they achieve their full potential and enjoy the same rights as men.
As has been the case for several years, all proposals relevant to children are expected to respect the child's right to participate and be aligned with Article 24 of the Charter, relevant EU law and the UN Convention on the rights of the child and describe how they will contribute to the implementation of the 10 principles for integrated child protection systems (see bibliography). This year, we expect applicants to take ownership of this requirement and consider and document what every phase of their project means for child participation. The child's right to be heard, and to be involved in all decisions that concern him or her, as set out in UNCRC Article 12 and General Comment No 12, must be an integral part of all project activities. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project, for example in designing and reviewing responses to reports and actual cases of child victims, in reviewing services, in assessing what needs to be changed at system level, in empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them and in empowering children and young people to help themselves and other children, on child-sensitive services for sexual and gender-based violence, in consulting children on the rollout and design of child safeguarding policies in a particular setting or type of organisation, on how to make the policy clear for all children, in designing the policy in a child-friendly way, on how to inform parents and other adults, etc. Are there possibilities to involve children in project design prior to submission of proposals? Are the views of children on issues addressed in the call (possibly gathered elsewhere, including through other EU projects – see compilation) reflected in the proposal? Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast (see bibliography). Child participation aspects will be assessed under the quality criterion.
Projects funded under this call shall also comply with the prohibition of discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ""Charter""), in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter. Among others the Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all its staff and team. The beneficiary is encouraged to foster an appropriate mix of people, whatever their ethnic origin, religion, age, gender and ability.
Finally, all projects under this call shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter.
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the beneficiaries of funding (including partners) need to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy if they will be working directly with children. However, given the subject matter of these calls, for all projects concerning children, child safeguarding must be central to project design and implementation, and must be addressed. The applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to (see Annex 4 of the Guide for applicants). A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in ""Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them"" issued by Keeping Children Safe (see bibliography). The quality of the applicant’s child safeguarding/protection policy will be assessed under award criterion b) quality.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. For priorities 1, 2, 3 and 4, this should go well beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and consider how best to assess how activities and the use of project outputs impact on attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group(s), e.g. there is lower tolerance of gender-based violence and the target group reports actual intervention or states they are more likely to intervene when witnessing it, or when witnessing a situation that could lead to gender-based violence, victims are more likely to report experiences of violence, the target group uses learned techniques in their daily/working life, etc. Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. For priorities 1, 2, 3 and 4, it should provide reliable results on ""what works"" and ""what does not work"" (for further details please refer to ""Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers"", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion) – see bibliography. See also Turning the Curve: outcomes-based accountability in the bibliography.
Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The aim of this call is to support integrated and multidisciplinary child-centred approaches (such as children's houses/Barnahus) to child victims of violence in line with Directive 2012/29/EU to contribute to better reporting, investigation, treatment, follow-up and judicial involvement in cases of violence against children. Proposals shall complement the efforts of the EU in the area of rights of the child and child protection, and contribute to integrated child protection systems. To this end, proposals should be carried out in line with the 10 Principles for integrated child protection systems, and proposals should describe how their project implements the principles.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will fund activities for two priorities focusing on different types of activities. Project proposals must specify whether one (specifiying which) or both of the sub-priorities is/are addressed. Priority two is only relevant where an integrated and mulitidisciplinary child-centred approach to child victims of violence already exist, or is about to be implemented. Proposals that do not address at least one of the priorities of this call will not be considered.
All proposals must aim to ensure a child-friendly response to violence against children that is interagency, multidisciplinary, comprehensive and, where possible, under one roof (Barnahus/children's house model). Children's house models can be found in Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Croatia.
Priority 1: mutual learning, exchange of good practices, capacity-building to design and adapt proven children's house models to the national context, multi-agency collaboration and protocols (e.g. police, prosecutors, judges, social workers, child protection authorities, health, mental health and education services). Activities can be foreseen to include capacity-building on particular areas of the children's house model, such as medical exams and evaluations, joint investigative interviews, victim therapy, family counselling/support, as well as education training and research. All projects must aim to foster cooperation at local, regional, and national level among child protection professionals and agencies. Development of integrated and targeted strategies to enhance multi-disciplinary and interagency cooperation between relevant actors providing support to victims, including in the fields of health, education, employment and social assistance.
Priority 2:capacity building, education and awareness-raising for stakeholders This can include capacity building and awareness-raising for professionals and other adults who come into regular contact with children and are the first points of contact for (potential) (child) victims of violence so that they: are aware of child safeguarding standards and the role and mandate of national interagency and multidisciplinary child-centred approaches to child victims; can better assess risks and meet the specific needs of child victims, in particular by signposting them to integrated multidisciplinary specialist support services (such as children's houses). The target group is thus likely to include: professionals and other adults in the education, health, sports and leisure, child protection/welfare, parents/caregivers, alternative/corporate care, law enforcement and justice sectors, child helplines and hotlines, etc. The applicant should explain the rationale and their choice of target group.
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impact on the lives of child victims. All projects should not only develop a sound methodology using recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but consist of a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes, ultimately to improve children's experience of the justice and child protection systems. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries (children), and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for children. This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposal should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. Any training modules developed should be made available and be easily adaptable for use in all EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate and be aligned with Article 24 of the Charter, relevant EU law and the UN Convention on the rights of the child. The child's right to be heard, as set out in UNCRC Article 12 and General Comment No 12, must be an integral part of all project activities.
Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project, for example in designing and reviewing responses to reports and actual cases of child victims, in reviewing services, in assessing what needs to be changed at system level, in empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them and in empowering children and young people to help themselves and other children, etc. Are there possibilities to involve children in project design prior to submission of proposals? Are the views of children on issues addressed in the call (possibly gathered elsewhere) reflected in the proposal?
Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast."

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
The aim is to support Member States' efforts to address challenges arising from intra-EU mobility whilst also promoting and facilitating the effective exercise of the free movement rights by EU citizens and their family members. Project activities should foster the successful inclusion and participation of mobile EU citizens and their family members in the host EU country's civic and/or political life and/or their participation in the democratic life of the EU, particularly with a view to the 2019 European elections. Action grants will complement but not duplicate the work the Commission is funding in this domain following the publication of the 2017 Citizenship report, and of the work being funded through the European Parliament's pilot projects on e-voting and e-democracy.
Action is needed to support and enhance the democratic participation of mobile EU citizens, particularly underrepresented groups such as women and young people. This complementary call for action grants is to elaborate on the increased focus on the exercise of democratic rights in the run-up to the European elections, and of the work being funded through the European Parliament's pilot projects on e-voting and e-democracy, as a part of the Commission’s wider work on citizens’ participation.
2. Description of the activities
Development, exchanges and dissemination of best practices amongst national/regional/local authorities and civil society organisations. Support understanding of relevant national/regional/local rules and their interaction with EU citizenship rights. Directly support the participation of mobile EU citizens in both civic and political life of their host society through information and advice. This could involve in particular (NB. The list is indicative and focusses on the intended outcome of the projects):
inclusion policies / best practices which do not solely focus on one profile of EU mobile citizens but take into account both the different needs of these EU citizens as well as the challenges big/smaller cities, are facing when welcoming EU mobile citizens (e.g. housing, schooling, inclusion to the job market, involvement in community decision-making and volunteering etc.) and which promote multiculturalism;
ways of fostering and supporting engagement in public debate (including through e.g. access to cross-border political information and facilitation of access to local political information) and participation in local and EU elections, including of young people, women and EU citizens living in another EU country than their own. This can be achieved through digital, interactive, innovative tools and/or best practices (debates, campaigns, initiatives, information, events, administrative practice etc.);
best practices/toolkits for newly arriving EU mobile citizens and their families, including on helping them settle down, find a job/training, participate in democratic life in the local community and create links in/with the local community;
dissemination of practical information and advice on what are the rights, including voting rights, and responsibilities of EU mobile citizens in a given country/region/city and assistance in seeing them through.
3. Expected results
Increased capacity of national, regional and local experts to enable and facilitate the participation of mobile EU citizens in their host Member State;
Increased capacity of national, regional and local experts to promote and welcome EU mobile citizens;
Strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent national, regional and local authorities in relation to enabling mobile EU citizens' participation in their host MS and local communities;
Alignment of the administrative practices in relation to the applicable EU rules in different Member States;
Improvement in the information provided to support the participation of EU citizens in the political and social life of their host communities;
Improvement in the availability, awareness and participation of mobile EU citizens in civic activities in their host communities, such as volunteering groups and local decision making bodies, including school boards and community organisations."

1. Priorities
1. Actions aim to promote awareness on EU citizenship rights and foster inclusion of mobile EU citizens and democratic participation of mobile EU citizens and under-represented groups, including women, Roma, young people and EU citizens living in another EU Member State than their own. These actions should support the efforts of Member States and civil society organisations in this domain, complementing and not duplicating the work being funded elsewhere by the Commission. The actions must be operational and practical and must either support citizens directly or support the work of groups and/or organisations tasked with supporting the participation of citizens.

Actions aim to support the establishment of national election networks, involving authorities with competence for electoral matters and authorities in charge of monitoring and enforcing rules related to activities relevant to the electoral context, including data protection authorities, media regulators, cybersecurity authorities etc. Actions will create fora for facilitating the swift, secured exchange of information on issues capable of affecting the elections, including by jointly identifying threats and gaps, sharing findings and expertise and liaising on the application and enforcement of relevant rules in the online environment. These networks should, whenever appropriate, in accordance with national law, consult and cooperate with the relevant national law enforcement authorities. The action will also provide for national contact points to liaise at the European level, to facilitate the sharing of expertise and best practices among Member States including on threats, gaps and enforcement. The overall purpose is to support the integrity of free and fair elections in Europe, preserving the democratic institutions and citizens’ participation in them. Coordination within and among such networks could serve in particular to alert on threats, exchange on best practices among national networks, discuss common solutions to identified challenges and encourage common projects and exercises among national networks.
2. Description of the activities
Whereas several measures and initiatives are listed, it is not requested to include all of them in a single project. Projects with a strong focus are very much valued.
1. To promote awareness on EU citizenship rights and foster inclusion of mobile EU citizens and democratic participation of mobile EU citizens and under-represented groups
Activities may consist of any of the following: training, awareness raising, community outreach, capacity building or support (for officials or citizens), pilots or development of tool/processes or training material and exchanges and dissemination of best practices amongst public authorities and civil society organisations. This could involve, in particular, any of the following:
ways of fostering engagement in the democratic life of the European Union (through e.g. skills and capacity building among candidates, community championing, access to cross-border political information and facilitation of access to local political information) and representation as well as participation in local and EU elections, including of young people, women and EU citizens living in another EU country than their own (through e.g. digital, interactive, innovative tools, and/or through making the process more accessible, identifying and removing obstacles or supporting group empowerment);
inclusion policies and best practices which do not solely focus on one profile of mobile EU citizens, but rather take into account both the different needs of these EU citizens as well as the challenges cities are facing when welcoming them (e.g. housing, schooling, inclusion to the job market, involvement in community decision-making and volunteering etc.), and which promote multiculturalism;
dissemination of practical information and advice on what are the rights, including voting rights, and responsibilities of mobile EU citizens in a given country/region/city and assistance in seeing them through.
Indicative amount: € 730 000
2. Restricted to national public authorities: to support national coordination electoral networks and a European coordination of these networks
Activities may consist of workshops, seminars, conferences, expert meetings at various levels as appropriate (high level meetings may be needed to coordinate on policy approaches, while technical exchanges among experts may be needed to implement such policies); mutual learning, cooperation exercises; analytical studies; awareness raising activities, as well as information exchange platforms.
Indicative amount: € 770 000
Activities must take place in countries participating to the REC Programme to be eligible for funding.
3. Expected results
Whereas numerous results are listed below, it is not expected for a single project to produce all of them. Projects bringing limited, but effective results are very much valued.
1. To increase awareness rising on EU citizenship rights as well as to foster inclusion of mobile EU citizens and democratic participation of mobile EU citizens and under-represented groups, in particular through:
improved availability, awareness and participation of mobile EU citizens in civic activities in their host communities, such as volunteering groups and local decision making bodies, including school boards and community organisations;
increased capacity of national, regional and local experts to enable and facilitate the participation of mobile EU citizens in the political and social life of their host communities;
strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent public authorities in relation to enabling mobile EU citizens' participation in their host Member States and local communities.
2. To support national coordination electoral networks and a European coordination of these networks, in particular through:
improved monitoring and understanding of the system challenges and risks to the administration of elections and to the wider regulatory framework which sets the conditions needed for preserving the integrity of democratic elections in Europe, also from a cross-border perspective;
increased capability and awareness of authorities and relevant bodies involved in elections of their respective roles and responsibilities in this domain and their better collaboration.
streamlined and effective European level coordination in electoral matters."

Priorities and activities to be funded
For the purposes of this call gender-based violence is defined as violence directed against a person because of that person's gender or as violence that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately.
Violence against children is understood to mean ""all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect of negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation including sexual abuse"" as listed in Article 19(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx) and in alignment with the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child's General comment No. 13 (2011) on the right of the child to freedom from all forms of violence (http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/CRC.C.GC.13_en.pdf).
1. Priorities
1.1 Prevention of gender-based violence (GBV): The focus is on primary prevention, i.e. changing social attitudes and behaviour, in order to end tolerance of all forms of violence. This involves tackling prejudices and gender stereotypes and norms that encourage or condone violence, as well as preventing victimisation through education about healthy relationships and their rights.
(Indicative amount: 2 500 000 EUR)
1.2 Protection and support for victims of gender-based violence and violence against children, including through tackling under-reporting and promoting multi-disciplinary cooperation among relevant professionals (For projects relevant to children, see child rights approach definition: paragraph 59 of General Comment No 13 of the UN Committee on the rights of the child).
This priority aims to contribute to the implementation of:
Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime;
Directive 2011/99/EU on the European Protection Order; and/or
Regulation 606/2013 on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters
(Indicative amount: 3 206 000 EUR)
1.3 The coordination and/or adaptation of support services for sexual and gender-based violence to include refugees and migrants (children, women, LGBTQI persons, young men and boys), in particular to ensure their recovery from such trauma. The aim is not to create new or parallel services but to adapt them in an inclusive manner. This call will not fund operating or running costs, but is intended to build capacity and adapt frameworks to include people in migration, in a practical way, for example where outreach to new reception facilities and structures are needed or where the involvement of cultural mediators/interpreters could help.
(Indicative amount: 3 000 000 EUR)
1.4 Treatment of perpetrators, in order to prevent reoffending.
The aim is to support the development of perpetrator treatment programmes and capacity-building among professionals working in this area, with the aim of preventing reoffending and further protecting victims.
(Indicative amount: 1 000 000 EUR)
1.5 National coordinating frameworks or action plans for violence against children (supporting Member States and other actors). The aim is to support Member States in developing and implementing national coordinating frameworks to eliminate all forms of violence against children (which would cover a number of different areas and issues), in line with the 10 Principles for integrated child protection systems and taking account of the Council of Europe Policy Guidelines on Integrated National Strategies for the Protection of Children from Violence as well as United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment 13 (2011) on the right of the child to freedom from all forms of violence.
(Indicative amount: 3 000 000 EUR)
2. Description of the activities
Project activities may include:
For all priorities:
mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation
design and implementation of protocols, development of working methods which may be transferable to other regions or countries
capacity building and training for professionals
For priorities 1 and 2:
awareness-raising and education activities
For priority 3:
empowerment of refugee/migrant communities and efforts to include them in support services
adaptation of existing services/structures/frameworks/methodology, including outreach to new reception facilities and structures or involvement of new actors (e.g. cultural mediators/interpreters)
For priority 5:
development or adaptation and/or implementation of national coordinating frameworks or action plans for violence against children, taking account of the different national starting points (See in particular Section VI of GC 13);
awareness-raising and capacity-building to foster participation and ownership in the development of such national frameworks or action plans in line with paragraph 71 of United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No 13 (2011, for instance through a multidisciplinary working group which meets regularly and has appropriate decision-making power.
Given the challenges and known gaps in national as well as transnational cooperation and coordination, all proposals submitted under priorities, 2, 3 and 5, should describe how their project would enhance interagency and multidisciplinary cooperation and collaboration, both at national and at transnational levels (e.g. in planning for dealing with cases with crossborder aspects), including across governmental departments, to ensure the closer involvement of relevant authorities, in cooperation with other actors (e.g. civil society, academia, practitioners, etc.). Such frameworks will need to be integrated with other sectoral frameworks.
For priority 5, all proposals will be scrutinised closely and measured against the Council of Europe Policy Guidelines on Integrated National Strategies for the Protection of Children from Violence and United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment No 13 (2011) on the right of the child to freedom from all forms of violence. The national starting point(s) and the rationale for project choices must be clearly described. The degree to which the proposal is aligned with these two documents will be evaluated under the award criterion ‘a) relevance’.
For priorities 1, 2, 3 and 4, projects are welcome to focus on specific forms of violence or particular groups of victims. Proposals should include justification for these choices, which will be assessed under the award criterion ‘a) relevance’.
This call does not aim to fund projects in the areas of:
conformity assessments of the transposition of Directive on the rights of victims of crime (2012/29/EU) into national law.
The following types of activities will not be funded by the Commission:
activities supporting individual political parties
provision of financial support to third parties
legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives.
***
Applicants are invited to take note of previously funded projects:
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants/results/daphne-toolkit/;
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/files/rights_child/compilation_previously_funded_projects_rights_of_the_child_and_violence_against_children.pdf;
and http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/closed-calls/index_en.htm
The continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives, including the scaling up of existing initiatives and/or testing them in a different context, may be funded if it is aligned with one of the priorities. However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.
Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission or referred to below (see bibliography). The degree of relevance to the priorities of the call for proposals will be assessed under the award criterion ‘a) relevance’.
For projects in the area of violence against children, projects must take a rights-based approach and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC). Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.
This call aims to fund targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts on the lives of beneficiaries. The projects should be practical projects rather than research and should include a combination of elements to form a coherent whole. All projects should not only develop a sound methodology using recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but consist of a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits, positive outcomes and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries, and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. Activities such as the development of materials, the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.
For priorities 1, 2, and 4 applicants are, where appropriate and possible, encouraged to embed a ""behavioural"" approach (for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf) in their project, as a solution to the issues at stake often requires behavioural change. Behavioural sciences seek to understand how people make decisions in practice; how their behaviour is influenced by the context in which their decisions are made and how they are likely to respond to certain options. We welcome applications that clearly identify the behavioural element at stake (i.e. the factor(s) that has/have an impact on the target group's decision and behaviour).
Any training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for the beneficiaries. This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposals should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.
All projects for each of the priorities under this call can be either national or transnational and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players, such as child protection agencies, police, health services, the judiciary, victim support organisations, helplines, refugee and asylum seeker services, social workers, etc. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players. Good quality cooperation among partners will be instrumental in making innovative projects successful. Regardless of whether projects are national or transnational in nature, they should aim to produce results that create or contribute to implementation of standards at European level, or that could be transferable to other Member States.
At least one public authority from each participating country must either be involved in the project (as applicant or co-applicant) or by providing substantial support. For projects related to gender-based violence, these public authorities can be national, regional or local Ministries/agencies/equality bodies responsible for gender equality and/or provision of services to victims of violence or perpetrators; police, judicial, health or education authorities etc., as relevant. For projects related to children, these public authorities can be Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services, national guardianship institutions, Ministries for children, child protection, education, health, social affairs, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, etc). The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project Description and Implementation. In practical terms, it means that if, for instance, a transnational project is submitted by a partnership involving four different eligible countries, at least four public authorities as described above (one per each eligible country) must either be involved in the project as applicant or partner(s) or express in writing their support for the application. In the latter case, this support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application. The requirement will be assessed under the award criterion b) quality.
Mainstreaming
Projects funded under this call shall also seek to promote equality between women and men and the rights of the child. Gender and rights of the child mainstreaming means integrating a gender and rights of the child perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a project, as appropriate. Consequently, when relevant, the applicant shall take the necessary steps to ensure that gender equality and child-related issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men and of children. It is, for example, essential that projects do not silence, stereotype, stigmatise, lay the blame on or discriminate against women or men. Projects should contribute to empowering women and to ensuring that they achieve their full potential and enjoy the same rights as men.
All proposals relevant to children are expected to respect the child's right to participate and be aligned with Article 24 of the Charter, relevant EU law and the UN Convention on the rights of the child and describe how they will contribute to the implementation of the 10 principles for integrated child protection systems (see bibliography). The child's right to be heard, as set out in UNCRC Article 12 and General Comment No 12, must be an integral part of all project activities. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project, for example in designing and reviewing responses to reports and actual cases of child victims, in reviewing services, in assessing what needs to be changed at system level, in empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them and in empowering children and young people to help themselves and other children, etc. Are there possibilities to involve children in project design prior to submission of proposals? Are the views of children on issues addressed in the call (possibly gathered elsewhere) reflected in the proposal? Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast (see bibliography).
Projects funded under this call shall also comply with the prohibition of discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ""Charter""), in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter. Among others the Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all its staff and team. The beneficiary is encouraged to foster an appropriate mix of people, whatever their ethnic origin, religion, age, gender and ability.
Finally, all projects under this call shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter.
Child protection/safeguarding policy
If a project will involve direct contact with children, the beneficiaries of funding (including partners) need to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work directly with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy if they will be working directly with children. However, given the subject matter of these calls, for all projects concerning children, child safeguarding must be central to project design and implementation, for example for national coordinating frameworks, and must be addressed. The applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to (see Annex 4 of the Guide for applicants). A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in ""Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them"" issued by Keeping Children Safe (see bibliography). The quality of the applicant’s child safeguarding/protection policy will be assessed under award criterion b) quality.
Monitoring and evaluation
Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator for further details please refer to ""Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making"", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. For priorities 1, 2 and 4, this should go beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and assess how activities and the use of deliverables have led to attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group, e.g. there is lower tolerance of gender-based violence and the target group states they are more likely to intervene when witnessing it, or when witnessing a situation that could lead to gender-based violence, victims are more likely to report experiences of violence, the target group uses learned techniques in their daily/working life, etc. Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. For priorities 1, 2, 3 and 4, it should provide reliable results on ""what works"" and ""what does not work"" (for further details please refer to ""Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers"", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion) – see bibliography. Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.
Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results
Applications should include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results. The projects should aim at ensuring their durability and appropriate dissemination, including at the end of funding (by promoting and enabling access to their results to the widest possible audience).

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
The Commission is committed to curb the trends of online hate speech in Europe. For that purpose, on 31st May 2016, the Commission agreed on a Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1937_en.htm). The call is thus aimed at supporting projects in the field of countering hate speech online, including projects aimed at contributing to better understand, monitor, prevent and counter hate speech online. The call for proposals to monitor, prevent and counter hate speech online will support the following priorities:
- Projects aimed at development, studies and analyses of the sociological landscape and trends on hate speech online;
- Projects on developing online alternative and counter-narratives and promoting the development of critical thinking by Internet users;
- Projects aimed at countering illegal hate speech online on social platforms/Internet companies (As defined under national laws transposing the Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA, on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law) and enhancing transparency on how manifestations of hate speech are addressed in the online world.
Proposals building on the activities relating to the implementation of the Code of Conduct on countering hate speech online are of particular interest.
Projects aimed at research and analysis of the sociological landscape relating to the origin and spread of hate speech on social media platforms are expected to build on prior studies and focus on analysis (including through the quantitative analysis of publicly available datasets) of current or new trends of forms of intolerance online and its path of dissemination, such as extremist ideas leading to violence or hatred against minorities.
Projects aimed at development of online alternative and counter-narratives and its dissemination are expected to build on existing best practices and target the specificities of particular forms of intolerance. Projects aimed at developing automatic technologies/responses as means of counter-narratives to racist and xenophobic speech are of particular interest. While proposals do not need to be transnational, the added value of projects involving organisations from more than one participating country is of particular interest.
Projects aiming at tackling online hate speech against journalists, collecting data related to online abuse against media actors and analysing its effects on the democratic debate (as a follow-up of the 2016 Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights) are also one of the priorities of the call.
Projects tackling intersectionality and multiple grounds of hatred including misogyny online and hate speech based on gender-related grounds will be regarded as having an added value, as a follow-up to the 2017 Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights on ""Women's rights in turbulent times"" (http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item-detail.cfm?item_id=115277).
While projects may focus only on one of the priorities of the call, projects combining different priorities will be regarded as having an added value. Moreover, while projects can be national and only cover one Member State, projects covering several countries or which may, in the future, be transferable to other countries will be considered to have an added value.
2. Description of the activities
In relation to the above mentioned priorities, the call will fund projects focused on one or more of the following activities:
- development of technology and innovative web tools preventing and countering illegal hate speech online and supporting data collection. This will include development of online repositories of court jurisprudence and/or concrete cases of manifestations of illegal hate speech online notified to online platforms.
- studies analysing the spread of racists and xenophobic hate speech in different Member States, including the source and structures of groups generating and spreading such content, the volume and the frequency of content upload, the networks and networking activities, platform choices, as well as its reach-out to mainstream society and the appeal of racists and xenophobic material that incites to violence.
- development, dissemination and online awareness raising activities, in particular: development of online narratives promoting EU values, tolerance and respect to EU fundamental rights and fact checking activities enhancing critical thinking and awareness about accuracy of information (These activities should be targeted to hate speech online and complementary to the 2017 Commission Directorate General Communications Networks, Content and Technology’s call for proposals “Call for Proposals for a pilot project on Media Literacy for All”).
- mutual learning, exchange of good practices, including identifying best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries or organisations.
- capacity building and training activities. This includes activities aimed at training stakeholders on EU and national legal framework criminalising hate speech online.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: The documentation of cultural assets is inherently a multimedia process, addressed through digital representation of the shape, appearance and conservation condition of the heritage/cultural object. The digital model is expected to become the representation (forever, for everybody, from everywhere) and research needs to acknowledge the changing role that reconstruction, preservation and conservation now play in the representation of heritage and its analysis. Given the key role the digital model now plays, it is vital that its representation benefits new scholarship, research and developments in interpretation alongside the practical elements of curation, display and dissemination of knowledge. The 3D representations should go beyond current levels of visual depictions, support information integration/linking, shape-related analysis and provide the necessary semantic information for in-depth studies by researchers and users. This will offer new perspectives to researchers and new understandings to citizens, research users and the cultural and creative industries.. Digital surrogates can add a laboratory dimension to on-site explorations, generating new, more innovative questions challenges for our knowledge. It also can originate new avenues in the way tangible cultural heritage is studied, visualised, curated, displayed and monitored, significantly improving our understanding of Europe's unique cultural diversity and our capacity to communicate rich narratives about the past.
This challenge requires collaborations across disciplines, technologies and sectors, such as history, archaeology, cultural studies, anthropology and other areas of humanities and social science research on one side, and creative practice and digital developments in areas such as design and visual arts on the other side. The generation of high quality 3D models is still very time-consuming and expensive, not least because the modelling is carried out for individual objects rather than for entire collections. Furthermore, the outcome of digital reconstructions is frequently provided in formats that are not interoperable, and therefore cannot be easily accessed and/or re-used by scholars, curators or those working in cultural and heritage industries. This presents a risk to the sustainability of the reconstructions. This topic allows for a scaling up of such approaches in seeking to create researcher-led actions that will increase capacity and capability in this area..
Scope: The specific challenge will be addressed by the focused actions:
a)      Research on cost-effective technologies for advanced 3D modelling to enhance the understanding of cultural heritage. This interdisciplinary research should focus on developing new methods and tools for automated 3D modelling and analysis of physical cultural resources and assets (e.g. cultural heritage sites, monuments, sculptures, archaeological sites…) beyond simple digital reconstruction. Driven by the specific needs of the cultural heritage research community and research questions relating to culture and identity that can be enriched through new understandings of tangible heritage objects, projects can explore solutions such as the consolidation of imperfect data, spatio-temporal analysis, modelling/simulation of material degradation, joint reconstruction within and across collections and semantic-aware representation, taking into account the wide range of capture devices and sources of measurement data. Work should facilitate the creation of high-fidelity models of objects with particularly challenging features as regards surface, transparency, dimensions etc. Test-beds for such technological development should validate the practical application and analytic potential of new models for research, interpretation, scholarship and innovation in curation and dissemination. The resulting models should enable greater understanding of European tangible cultural assets by researchers and citizens as well as direct reuse for innovative and creative applications.
b)      Devise standard formats for the semantic-aware 3D modelling of Europe's cultural heritage for researchers and practitioners. Proposals should extend or develop standard formats of 3D semantic-aware objects with a view to improve their archiving, reusability and sustainability. The proposed formats should enable easy exchange, publishing and use of 3D models that have been acquired or generated by a wide range of devices or software. Central goal of these standardisation activities is the applicability, usability and sustainability of the 3D models to the European and international research and cultural heritage communities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The research under this topic will provide new benefits to researchers through the development of cost efficient tools and effective methods for the modelling and understanding of Europe's cultural heritage. It will also promote interoperable standard formats for semantic-aware 3D modelling, analysis, and representation of cultural heritage in order to allow easy distribution , publishing and reuse of such models, which in turn will ensure sustainable cross-sector collaborative work in both development and research in future..

Research and technological development constitute a very important means of supporting European energy objectives with regard to the supply of European coal and its competitive and environmentally friendly conversion and utilisation. Moreover, the growing international dimension of the coal market and the global scale of the problems confronting it means that the European Union has to take a leading role in meeting challenges relating to modern techniques, mine safety and environmental protection at worldwide level by ensuring the transfer of know-how required for further technological progress, improved working conditions (health and safety) and enhanced environmental protection.
Scope:
Proposals submitted under this topic must relate to one of the following research objectives (see Art 4 to 7 of Council Decision 2008/376/EC).
1. Improving the competitive position of Community coal
This objective aims at reducing the total costs of mining production, improving the quality of the products and reducing the costs of using coal. This may relate to any phase in the coal production chain:
modern techniques for surveying deposits;
behaviour and control of deposits in relation to rock pressure, gas emissions, the risk of explosion, ventilation and all other factors affecting mining operations;
integrated mine planning;
highly efficient, largely automated excavation and new and existing mining technologies corresponding to the geological characteristics of European hard coal deposits;
appropriate support technologies;
transport systems;
power supply services, communication and information, transmission, monitoring and process control systems;
coal preparation techniques, oriented to the needs of the consumer markets;
coal conversion;
coal combustion.
2. Health and safety in mines
This objectives covers issues concerning mine safety, including gas control, ventilation and air-conditioning with a view to improving underground working conditions and occupational health and safety as well as environmental issues.
3. Efficient protection of the environment and improvement of the use of coal as a clean energy source
This objective aims at minimising the impact of mining operations and the use of coal in the European Union on the atmosphere, water and the surface within the framework of an integrated management strategy with respect to pollution. As the European coal industry is undergoing constant restructuring, the research shall also be geared towards minimising the environmental impact of underground mines destined for closure. This includes:
(a) a reduction in emissions from coal utilisation, including capture and storage of CO2,
(b) a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in particular methane, from coal deposits;
(c) the return to the mine of mining waste, fly ash and desulphurisation products, accompanied, where relevant, by other forms of waste;
(d) the refurbishment of waste heaps and the industrial use of residues from coal production and consumption;
(e) the protection of water tables and the purification of mine drainage water;
(f) a reduction in the environmental impact of installations which mainly use EU coal and lignite;
(g) the protection of surface installations against the effects of subsidence in the short and long term.
4. Management of external dependence on energy supply
The objective covers prospects for long-term energy supply and concerns the upgrading, in economic, energy-related and environmental terms, of coal deposits which cannot be extracted economically by conventional mining techniques. Projects may include studies, the definition of strategies, fundamental and applied research and the testing of innovative techniques which offer prospects for the upgrading of EU coal resources. This includes the integration of complementary techniques such as the adsorption of methane or carbon dioxide, coal bed methane extraction and underground coal gasification."

Objective: The Research Programme for the Research Fund for Coal and Steel supports research activities aimed at the following objectives defined for coal:
Improving the competitive position of Community coal (Coal 1)
Health and safety in mines (Coal 2)
Efficient protection of the environment and improvement of the use of coal as a clean energy source (Coal 3)
Management of external dependence on energy supply (Coal 4)
Scope:Proposals must relate to the production, preparation, conversion or utilisation of coal*. *the definition of ""coal"" given under Art. 3 of the RFCS Legal Basis applies
Expected impact: Coal is both a key ingredient in steel production, and is needed as a source of energy to ensure Europe has a secure supply. 40% of world electricity generation derives from coal. Coal remains the main energy source for some EU countries (93% of Polish electricity is produced from coal). There is no doubt that this resource finds a preeminent role in a balanced energy mix for Europe. Consequently, Europe must develop critical clean coal technologies, carbon sequestration technology for existing and future coal-fired plants for electricity production, and increased efficiency in the entire extraction and utilisation cycle.

In order to secure sustainable supply of raw materials to the EU society, the raw materials sector needs to strengthen its performance and competitiveness through research and innovation. Stronger integration of national and regional R&I programmes across the whole EU is needed to tap the potential of available funding and to reach the critical mass pushing the EU raw materials sector to the forefront in the sustainable production of primary and secondary raw materials and scarce materials substitution.
Scope:
The objective of the ERA-NET is to strengthen co-ordination of national and regional research programmes in the field of non-energy non-agricultural raw materials, while building on the experience of ERA-MIN ERA-NET. This should be achieved in line with the integrated strategy proposed in the EU Raw Materials Initiative (RMI) and the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials. The ERA-NET should cover the whole raw materials value chain including exploration, extraction and processing technologies and recycling, as well as substitution.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
Participation of legal entities from international partner countries and/or regions is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding[1] may nonetheless request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) for the co-ordination costs of additional activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to lead to:
achieving the objectives of the EIP Raw Materials, particularly in the area of research and innovation co-ordination;
reduced fragmentation of raw materials research and innovation efforts across Europe;

Proposals should enhance coordination and synergies, and avoid overlaps, between European and nationally or regionally funded research and innovation actions, and create links with related international programmes, as appropriate.
Proposals shall address the following issus:
Facilitating transnational cooperation between NCPs in Societal Challenge 5[1]: Support will be given to a network of formally nominated H2020 NCPs in the area of climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to this Societal Challenge as well as to the gender dimension of research and innovation, and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to enhancing the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials Societal Challenge and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under 'Science with and for Society'.
Only NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries and neighbourhood policy countries which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action. In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[2] international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with neighbourhood policy countries.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium of such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimate budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic.
Expected impact:
Improved and professionalised NCP service across the EU, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted. A more consistent level of NCP support services across the EU.
Type of action: Coordination and support actions

","Research and Innovation action
","08 November 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A more systematic observation of the Earth system is required at a resolution and accuracy that cannot always be provided through remote sensing technologies. There is therefore a need to extend and improve the in-situ component of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and of the EU Copernicus programme in order to collect the relevant data necessary to cover observation gaps, calibrate and validate remote-sensing data and deliver Earth Observation services, including monitoring variables, for policy makers, local users and citizens.
However, components of existing in-situ observing and monitoring systems are too often bulky, expensive and power hungry, which hinders their wide-scale deployment for continuous environmental monitoring. The challenge here is to explore and test new technological solutions that would lower the costs of acquiring, deploying and maintaining monitoring and observing stations which would contribute to filling the in-situ observational gaps of Earth observation systems. This issue is especially acute in less developed countries where in-situ Earth observation capacities have deteriorated.
Scope:
Actions should develop new, in-situ Earth observation systems, taking advantage of new technology and the latest developments in sensor science so that measurements can be performed using low energy sensors and communication systems, requiring less demanding maintenance. Actions should focus on the transfer and adaptation of new technologies into operational systems, enabling a real breakthrough in the efficiency of deploying and maintaining new in-situ observing systems in a cost-effective way. The research and innovation activities under this topic may take into account concepts such as citizens' observatories, disposable sensors, and the use of unmanned platforms. The project should take into account as much as possible relevant research outcomes from programmes of the European Research Council, the Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies and the European Metrology Research Programme[1].
Prominent criteria for the selection of the projects will be fulfilling agreed European and international standards regarding the quality of the measurements, and the interoperability for data exchange with other existing monitoring and observing platforms and with user applications. Proposals should establish formal links, where appropriate, with the GEO Global Initiatives (e.g. GEOGLAM, GEOBON, GFOI, GMOS, AFRIGEOSS, BLUE PLANET) and with the relevant Copernicus services so that the new monitoring and observing platforms fulfil well-identified needs under these two major initiatives. Test phases enabling proof-of-concept of the observation and monitoring platforms in real conditions should be organised during the course of the project. Participation of SMEs in project consortia is encouraged in order to facilitate the development of innovative and operational systems.
Projects should foresee activities to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and – if possible – also under other parts of Horizon 2020.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 million and EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
improved in-situ components of the GEOSS and Copernicus programmes;
cost-effectiveness of the new systems when compared to previous ones;
new opportunities and market development of the European Earth observation commercial sector and for downstream users;
measurable added value for the Copernicus and/or GEOSS initiatives;
the provision of information necessary to ensure food, water and energy security, to cope with the scarcity of natural resources, to develop mitigation and adaptation solutions to climate change, and to make communities more resilient to natural hazards;
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 9 'Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation'.

Specific Challenge: The specific challenge is to strengthen the Earth Observation networks (space-based, airborne, and particularly in-situ) of the broad European and North African, Middle East, and Balkan region to reinforce its contribution to the knowledge base for climate, natural resources, and raw materials.
The EU's contribution to the monitoring of our planet by land, sea, air and space-based Earth Observation systems remains too fragmented. In addition, geopolitical and economic events in recent years in the EU's southern and south-eastern neighbourhood regions have had adverse effects on infrastructures and services as well as on its already quite modest Earth Observation capacities. An improvement is therefore urgently needed to enable effective, sustainable planning and management of measures to cope with regional and global challenges such as food security, climate change and access to raw materials and energy.
Scope: Proposals should focus on Earth Observation related research activities with the aim of continuously providing timely and accurate information, forecasts and projections. In line with the EU’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] proposals should contribute to implementing the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and Copernicus.
Proposals shall address the following issue:
Integrating North African, Middle East and Balkan Earth Observation capacities in GEOSS: integrating, coordinating and supporting initiatives in these countries to deliver Earth Observation information services that will benefit critical economic and social sectors such as tourism, agriculture, transportation, health, research and education, while involving service providers in those sectors. Regional observational systems that are needed to complete GEOSS are of particular importance. In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[2] international cooperation is encouraged, ensuring a sufficient number of international partners from the target region to ensure adequate scale and scope of cooperation.
Expected impact:
Improved food security, access to raw materials and energy, and adaptation to climate change in the North-African, Middle-East, and Balkan regions due to improved Earth Observation data and information services. Rapid re-installation of the required infrastructures by the relevant public services and decision makers. Future investments in this region, leading to sustainable development of resources and activities. Strengthened competitiveness and performance of critical economic and social sectors such as tourism, agriculture, transportation, health, research, and education.

Specific challenge: Innovative SMEs have been recognised as being able to become the engine of the green economy and to facilitate the transition to a resource efficient, circular economy. They can play an important role in helping the EU to exit from the economic crises and in job creation. The potential of commercialising innovative solutions from SMEs is however hindered by several barriers including the absence of the proof of concept, the difficulty to access risk finance, the lack of prototyping, insufficient scale-up studies, etc. Growth therefore needs to be stimulated by increasing the levels of innovation in SMEs, covering their different innovation needs over the whole innovation cycle.
Innovative SMEs should be supported and guided to reach and accelerate their full green growth potential. This topic is targeted at all types of eco-innovative[1] SMEs in all areas addressing the climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials challenge, focusing on SMEs showing a strong ambition to develop, grow and internationalise. All kinds of promising ideas, products, processes, services and business models, notably across sectors and disciplines, for commercialisation both in a business-to-business (B2B) and a business-to-customer (B2C) context, are eligible.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Level of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the European Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific Challenge of 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

","03 March 2014
","24 September 2014","Scope:
  Specific challenge: Innovative SMEs have been recognised as being able to become the engine of the green economy and to facilitate the transition to a resource efficient, circular economy. They can play an important role in helping the EU to exit from the economic crises and in job creation. The potential of commercialising innovative solutions from SMEs is however hindered by several barriers including the absence of the proof of concept, the difficulty to access risk finance, the lack of prototyping, insufficient scale-up studies, etc. Growth therefore needs to be stimulated by increasing the levels of innovation in SMEs, covering their different innovation needs over the whole innovation cycle.
Innovative SMEs should be supported and guided to reach and accelerate their full green growth potential. This topic is targeted at all types of eco-innovative[1] SMEs in all areas addressing the climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials challenge, focusing on SMEs showing a strong ambition to develop, grow and internationalise. All kinds of promising ideas, products, processes, services and business models, notably across sectors and disciplines, for commercialisation both in a business-to-business (B2B) and a business-to-customer (B2C) context, are eligible.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Level of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the European Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific Challenge of 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The aim of this CSA is to further open the JPI Climate to international cooperation partners, including in Latin America, Africa or Asia, and to encourage engagement of a wider group of EU Member States and thus contribute to creating a coherent European Research Area open to the world. In addition, this action should consolidate the alignment of the R&I agendas of national, European Commission and other key players related to climate issues. Providing integrated, qualified climate knowledge and decision support services across sectors internationally is the main target, well in line with Horizon 2020 and SFIC strategies for internationalization of European skills at a time when research and innovation requirements for the Sustainable Development Goals (2016-2030) have been launched at United Nations level.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to create a framework and permanent dialogue to encourage, in a structured and strategic manner, the opening of the JPI Climate to international cooperation with key international climate research and innovation programmes, as well as funding and investment institutions. Proposals should also undertake activities to align with and support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular on climate change resilience, adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction. Flagship actions for possible joint funding with members of the JPI Water, JPI Urban Europe, JPI Oceans or key international cooperation partners and international programmes of strategic importance for the EU, such as the Belmont Forum, should also be identified and prepared for in advance.
This action should also organize and develop the knowledge base required to address climate challenges and EU policy priorities within a global perspective. This can be accomplished by providing open and integrated analysis of research results and recommendations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to combat climate change and its impacts. It should aim to contribute to: strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related hazards; integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning; improving education, awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, resource efficiency, adaptation, impact reduction, early warning and resilience to disasters; supporting LICs/LMICs in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, operationalization and evaluation of the Green Climate Fund; promoting mechanisms for raising capacities for effective climate change related planning and management in LICs/LMICs, including focusing on women, youth, local and marginalized communities.
The Commission considers that proposals with a duration of four years requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to contribute to:
increasing the scale and ambition of research and innovation activities for climate adaptation and mitigation for a resilient and efficient Europe that will valorise their know-how on climate solutions at global level in the context of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda;
making the JPI Climate, in close collaboration with the European Commission and others European initiatives involving Member States (such as Copernicus, JPI Water, JPI Oceans, JPI Urban Europe, GPC and SFIC), a privileged and attractive partner for global cooperation in climate research and innovation, notably in the context of the Global Framework for Climate Services, the Future Earth platform on global sustainability and the Belmont Forum;
strengthening the role of the JPI Climate for underpinning knowledge and evidence for supporting the implementation of related EU policies and for fostering the EU's common position in the global climate-related negotiations under UNFCCC;
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts', as well as the conclusions of the COP21 Paris Agreement.

","Research and Innovation action
","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Wild pollinators are declining in occurrence and diversity in the EU and numerous species are threatened with extinction. This is a serious cause for concern because pollinators are an integral part of healthy ecosystems, where they play a central role in the maintenance of ecosystem functioning. Without them, many plant species would decline and eventually disappear, along with the organisms that depend on them. Since the majority of European flowering plants (78 %) are pollinated by animals and around 84 % of European crop species benefit to various extents from insect pollination, the decline of pollinators will have far-reaching consequences on terrestrial ecosystems, their services and many plant species and can lead to their collapse in the long term. This would inevitably hinder the EU’s path to sustainable development and threaten economy and human wellbeing. Besides pollination services, pollinators can enhance, especially at landscape scale, other ecosystem services, such as pest control, soil and water quality, landscape aesthetics. This also contributes towards biodiversity conservation and diversity of crops underpinning a diverse, healthy human diet and nutritional security. In addition to the IPBES report on Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production (2016), valuable knowledge has been generated through past EU-funded projects and the European Red List of pollinators. While these clearly demonstrate an alarming decline of wild pollinators and warrant immediate action, the knowledge gaps are still considerable to assess the full extent of the decline and its repercussions on human society and the economy.
Scope:
Building on the results of previous and/or currently ongoing EU-funded research projects, taking account the follow-up of the IPBES assessment on pollinators, pollination and food production, and in line with the EU Pollinators Initiative, actions should develop tools, guidelines and methodologies to better understand, analyse, assess and possibly predict the trends and causes of the wild pollinators decline, in particular their interaction and cumulative effects, the links between pollinator, plant, biodiversity, under farming and other land management practices, and ecosystem functioning. They should assess and valuate the wild pollinators ecosystem services and their impacts on nature, society, human wellbeing and the economy at different spatial scales. Actions should address the relations between plant diversity and pollinator diversity, competition for floral resources and interchangeability, as well as factors determining spatio-temporal variation of pollinator communities, including ecological and human factors such as land use change, agricultural land management and climate change. Actions should bring further insight on how the composition and configuration of the landscape affects plant-pollinator interactions, what influences the pattern of movement of pollinators across landscapes and how changes in species mobility and foraging behaviour impact the reproduction of plants.
Actions should take advantage of data and information provided by the Copernicus programme, in particular from the Copernicus Land Monitoring and Climate Change Service. A systemic approach should be favoured considering all factors influencing plant - pollinator diversity and distribution. They should mobilise wider public engagement through, for example, citizen science initiatives and should undertake extensive knowledge dissemination and communication activities towards policy makers and other stakeholders, such as bee-keeping and farmers associations, civil society organisations such as NGOs, and the food industry and inform relevant science-policy processes and relevant policy actions at EU, Member State and regional levels.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
mitigation of causes and consequences and reverse trends in wild pollinators decline;
better informed EU-wide and global pollinators relevant policy and decision-making through timely dissemination of research outcomes to UN conventions, IPCC, IPBES and SBSTTA;
more accurate assessment, predictions, valuation and mapping of the multiple ecosystem services linked to wild pollinators, enabling their mainstreaming into natural capital accounts;
enabling adequate policy responses in the areas of the environment, agriculture and health, and allow tracking EU progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2 (‘Zero hunger’) and 15 (‘Life on land’);
delivering key knowledge for the preparation of key indicators and methodologies for monitoring pollinators;
an integrated assessment framework to address pollinators decline and its impacts on nature, society, human wellbeing and the economy."

","12 November 2019
","03 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
It is expected that, by 2050, half of the human population will live in cities[1] and possibly half of them will live in informal settlements without appropriate waste water collection infrastructure and treatment facilities. In view of the increasing pressure on water resources world-wide, collection, recycling and safe reuse of polluted water is considered to be an essential component for sustainable water resources management. Surface and groundwater in cities and downstream urban areas may suffer serious pollution from point and diffuse sources from upstream and in-catchment which might have a negative impact on the ecology, quality of life and land values in the city. Furthermore, urban run‐off, storm water and waste water represents a threat for water quality because of the pollutant load it conveys. Enhanced nature-based treatment solutions (such as artificial wetlands and lakes, bio-filtration, etc.) have the potential to remove pollutants from water (e.g. storm water, urban run‐off, river water, wastewater) that will lead to improved water quality and water use efficiency. Such natural treatment measures, when well planned and integrated into the overall urban planning and design, can also contribute to climate adaptation by reducing flood risk and heat island effects and constitute attractive components of the urban landscape. The innovation challenge is therefore how to design enhanced natural treatment systems that will provide effective ecological services of water purification and storage, as well as valuable habitats, constitute integral part of the overall urban water cycle and attractive components of the urban landscape and ensure that in closing the water cycle challenges associated with chemical and biological hazards are properly addressed through well-defined and validated risk assessment methodologies and implemented in relation to the final water use.
Scope:
Actions should identify and review examples of innovative natural water treatment systems in Europe and beyond to develop understanding of their functioning, the ecological processes involved and their capacity and performance in treating pollution under diverse and uncertain conditions, such as maximum/minimum loads, uncertainties on composition of the pollution entering the system, necessary time for the treatment, capacity to cope with temporal variation in rainfall, etc. They should develop methodologies and guidance for the design and implementation of urban enhanced natural treatment systems and their integration into the urban water cycle, the urban landscape and the receiving waters to enhance the circularity and hence sustainability of the overall system. They should develop new business models for their construction, operation and long-term management and maintenance and standards for the treatment processes and the different uses for which the effluent may be used within different regulatory frameworks.
Actions should include pilots/demonstrations for testing innovative approaches or the use of established solutions under new conditions and monitoring from baseline through construction and for a period of time, to establish the functionality of the system and assess the physical, social and economic benefits of the deployed solutions. Appropriate methodologies for public/social engagement in the implementation of such solutions should be developed.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant ongoing and future nature-based solutions relevant projects funded under previous and current H2020 Work Programmes for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events. To this end, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and /or task and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is strongly encouraged. International participants should explore the possibility to apply for co-funding under their national governments[2].
To ensure coverage of geographic, socio-economic and cultural diversity (including possible gender differences in the use/management of water) as well as sharing innovative solutions across the EU, pilot actions/demonstrations must be implemented in at least 3 cities situated in different Member States or Associated Countries that are committed to implement the proposed innovative actions/schemes during the project and assess their impacts and cost-efficiency.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
increased use of innovative natural water treatment measures as Nature-based solutions, integrated into the overall urban water cycle and constituting attractive components of the urban landscape for more sustainable urban water management that enhance the overall urban metabolic processes and mitigate impact on receiving waters;
enhanced water availability with reduced pressure on existing freshwater resources through treatment, remediation, reclamation and re-use of polluted water and wastewater steams;
increased investments into natural water treatment solutions from urban authorities, water companies or property developers through evidence of the benefits for deploying such ""systemic"" approaches as opposed to alternative water treatment systems;
sharing and cross-fertilization of capacity, expertise and know-how among European and international partners on new innovative natural water treatment concepts and solutions for enhanced opportunities for up-taking, upscaling and business in the European and global markets;
increased business opportunities for the design, development and installation of natural water treatment measures in cities.

So far each EU Member States has adopted its own (broadband) radio-communication system for security forces (police, first responders, etc.). Such systems are not necessarily compatible with each other. The EU has funded projects to help to overcome this issue, including a CSA (under Call DRS-18-2015) for buyers of such systems to develop the core set of specifications and tender documents to be used for national procurements, or the legal setting of alternate organisational solutions which remain to be implemented taking into account the requirements for interoperable next generation PPDR broadband communication systems.
Scope:
Phase 1: Plan and implement the tender procedures, based on a set of specifications and tender documents delivered by the BROADMAP project (grant agreement No 700380) and available upon request to the European Commission, for procuring:
prototype communication equipment's that will constitute the foreseen communication system
prototype instruments for validating the components of the foreseen communication system
Phase 2: Establishment of a (networked) validation centre equipped with these instruments. Sustainability of the Validation Centre beyond the lifetime of the project should be addressed, both with respect to its legal status and its funding sources.
Phase 3: Testing and validation of the prototype components of the foreseen communication system
Phase 4: Demonstration of the foreseen communication system in a multidisciplinary (firefighters, police departments, medical emergency services, etc.), international (involving practitioners from at least 10 Member States or Associated countries), and realistic scenario.
For grants awarded under this topic SEC-04-DRS-2017, beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming to ensure exploitation of its results:
To ensure that the outcome of the PCP action becomes also available to EU Member State national authorities as well as EU agencies not participating in the PCP for further procurement purposes, the proposal must necessarily state:
(1). Agreement from participating procurement authorities to negotiate, in good faith and on a case-by-case basis, with non-participating procurement authorities that wish to procure a capability or a product fully or partly derived from the PCP action, the use of the information required to run such a procurement process, and solely for that purpose.
(2). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to consult with any legal entity generating information to be released for the purpose set out in paragraph (1), unless contrary to applicable legislation.
(3). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to negotiate the use granted under paragraph (1) on Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The respective option on additional exploitation obligations of Article 28.1 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 10million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Established EU-interoperable broadband radio communication system for public safety and security, providing better services to first responders and police agencies and allowing shorter reaction times to prevent from casualties or victims, deployed by 2025.
For this impact to be as large as possible across the EU, special conditions have been attached to the CSA launched under Call DRS-18-2015 as regards access to standards, specifications, and all other relevant documents.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Technologies and innovations in the field of CBRN are developed by SMEs or larger companies which often face difficulties in bringing them to markets: because they address local, small niche markets; or because these SMEs have neither the capabilities nor the strategic objective to go for foreign markets; or because the individual technologies that they develop can make it to the market only if integrated and combined with other tools by other companies that have the capabilities and the strategy to market its products abroad, and possibly on the global market.
Such synergies among companies are not frequent in the area of CBRN technologies, which is to the detriment of industrial competitiveness, and which limits considerably the offer made to the practitioners if one compares with the actual technological state-of-the-art.
Scope:
A CBRN cluster could articulate two kinds of actions:
Part a) (2016): A CSA supported by a ""complementary grant""[1] will gather the largest number of European companies capable and willing to market their products globally (e.g. companies producing integrated equipment for First Responder's, CBRN software systems, detectors, decontaminators, waste management and encapsulation equipment). The participants in the CSA will provide platforms (toolkits and systems in the field of CBRN) in which to integrate the technologies and innovations developed by other companies under Part B). They will develop interfaces with financial institutions potentially interested in the sector, including through InnovFin instruments and accompanying measures. [2] The CSA will issue a list of technologies that need to be developed with a view to integrating them into the platforms, possibly building upon the inventory developed by the EDEN project[3] once made public.[4]
The CSA will deliver the first version of the catalogue on time for use in the implementation of Part b). The participants in the CSA will provide commercial and other services enabling access to the global market for the results of the RIA selected for support under Part b). The CSA will report publicly on its discussions, and assess and provide feedback on the impact of the business deals implemented with the research and innovation activities led by SMEs under Part b) of this topic.
Part b) (2017): Several RIA aiming at research and development of novel CBRN technologies and innovations identified in the above-mentioned catalogue will be selected by the European Commission. Each of these actions will be led by an SME. Each consortium implementing such a RIA must not only establish a consortium agreement among its members, but also a collaboration agreement with the participants in the CSA supported through Part a). Such a collaboration agreement must settle how the results from the RIA will be exploited and integrated into platforms managed by the CSA.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 to 7 for the RIA under part b); please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about € 2 million per action in 2016 and about € 3.5 million per action in 2017 would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The following options of the Model Grant Agreement will be implemented:
For grants awarded under this topic SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part a), beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming to ensure exploitation of its results: the CSA must commit to issue: at months 3 and 9 each year, during at least four years of activities, the catalogue of technologies mentioned in the scope of this topic and to make it available upon request; at month 6 each year, the reports of their discussions; and at month 12 each year, the above-mentioned assessment of impact. The respective option on additional exploitation obligations of Article 28.1 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
For grants awarded under this topic SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part b) option 1 of Article 41.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Grants awarded under this topic SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part a) will be complementary to the grant agreements under SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part b). The respective options of Article 2 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement[5] will be applied

Expected Impact:
Shorter time to market for novel CBRN technologies and innovations, and more business deals leading to industrial products of interest to more practitioners in Europe (and world-wide).
The larger the number of European companies involved in the CSA, the higher its impact will be.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Recent incidents in Europe and worldwide recalled that biological toxins can be produced by laypersons or acquired illegally and intentionally released in a criminal act to harm people. While different technologies are available for toxin detection and analysis, recent findings have shown that the comparability of analytical results from different laboratories is poor, which cast severe doubts about the validation of current methods and about the overall validity of analytical data. This means that in case of a bioterrorist act using compounds such as e.g. ricin (or others such as abrin), saxitoxin, botulinum, neurotoxins, enterotoxins, etc. there is no guarantee that decisions to react are made based on data meeting basic quality requirements. The lack of quality assurance/quality control tools (e.g. certified reference materials of ricin, botulinum, etc.) and standard operating procedures hampers the validation and the EU-wide comparability of biological toxin measurement data. There is therefore a need to develop an EU-wide approach for enhancing validating analytical capacities for biological toxin measurements in case of bioterrorism threats, similarly to what exists regarding chemical threats.
Scope:
The large variability among families of biological toxins complicates their measurement and unambiguous identification in human specimens, and environmental or food samples. Toxins are rapidly metabolised and degraded after incorporation, limiting the time window for successful identification and forensic analysis. Proposals should develop quality control tools, as well as the Standard Operating Procedures necessary for establishing a mechanism to systematically validate laboratory-based measurement techniques, including sample preparation strategies and analyses made in-situ issued by mobile and quickly deployable laboratories, which should be proposed for adoption at EU level.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 8million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
Development, production and certification of reference materials for biological toxin determinations as a basis for strengthened validation capacities;
Establishment of a stepwise learning inter-laboratory programme enabling relevant laboratories to improve their analytical skills and development and testing of an European Proficiency Testing (EPT) scheme from sampling to detection;
Mid term:
Improved capabilities for the validation and testing of existing and emerging techniques, including sample preparation strategies, mobile laboratories for in-situ analyses and technical approaches for forensic analysis, for the detection and identification of biological toxins; Replacement of old ""gold standards"" employing animal experiments with death as endpoint for detection of potent biological toxins, by modern, in vitro methods as requested by EU regulations;
Long term:
Based on the outcome of the EPT scheme, development of Standard Operational Procedures for the validation of analytical techniques, including in-situ techniques for biological toxin determinations in human specimens, environmental and food samples"

Trace evidence are essential for law enforcement and justice. Forensic investigations of trace evidence contribute to the reconstruction of crimes. Answers to how and when a trace was deposited may already be of great help in the initial phase of investigation, provided that such answers become quickly available, and at an acceptable cost.
As for DNA trace, the additional challenge is to build up an image of an unknown perpetrator of a crime, drawing from as many traces and sources and as fast as possible (preferably directly at the crime site), within legal frameworks and ethical rules.
Scope:
The forensic community still requires:
a) In the specific area of trace qualification:
Better knowledge of the composition of traces; of the time when they were left, whether they result from crime-related or inoffensive activities; of the effect, on the quality of traces, of the time elapsed between the moments when there are deposited and collected; of the transfer mechanisms, persistence and recovery of traces; of the circumstances of the trace deposit;
New tools, to be used in the field, that can detect, collect and analyse traces, and assist in the interpretation of trace data with a view to avoiding practitioner’s biases;
b) Alternatively, in the specific area of DNA extended exploitation:
Tools and techniques, and advanced methods for data analysis and statistical interpretation to extend the exploitation of DNA, which implement “privacy by design” (that take account of the status of personal data depending on the EU Member State legislations.
New method for complete sequencing to establish genetic composite sketch.
In addition, regarding both a) and b), proposals need: to address the issue of admissibility of evidence once securely transmitted to and from forensic experts in the field or in laboratories; to propose curricula for the training forensic investigators to use these new tools, techniques and methods; to propose methodologies to compare results produced by forensic organizations across Europe to contribute to the EU-wide consistency of forensic work.
In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission. Legal entities established in countries not listed in General Annex A and international organisations will be eligible for funding only when the Commission deems participation of the entity essential for carrying out the action.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 5million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
All proposals should contribute to:
Short/medium term:
Solving crimes more rapidly to reduce societal distress, investigative costs and the impact on victims and their relatives;
Improving forensic capabilities to evaluate different hypotheses used in criminal investigation and prosecution;
Providing forensic experts with instruments to avoid unnecessary analysis costs and time spent by forensic labs, and thus render the forensic process more efficient;
Long term:
Preventing miscarriage of justice due to the misinterpretation of forensic findings by the courts.
In addition:
Those proposals addressing a) should contribute to the better identification and understanding of crime related traces and the activities that have led to the deposition of the traces;
Those proposals addressing b) should contribute to the enhancement of the ability to obtain reliable information from DNA samples.

Since 2011 the EU has developed a vision about European Forensic Science 2020 including the creation of a European Forensic Science Area and the development of forensic science infrastructure in Europe.[1]
A wide, heterogeneous, variety of forensic tools are in use or being developed across Europe, making the comparison and exchange of information among forensic laboratories difficult and sometimes impossible, which limits the use of forensic data in cross-border investigations, and in foreign courts. Forensic data need to be quickly available, at an acceptable cost, across borders.
Scope:
The most promising forensic techniques need to be developed further, and brought up from experiment to a toolkit usable on a daily basis across Europe. This can be achieved if forensic laboratories from a broad variety of EU countries with diverse legal systems agree on common technical standards and join forces along the following steps:
Phase 0: To prepare an inventory of forensic technologies already available at TRL 4 or 5, and to identify, within all areas covered by the various ENFSI working groups (http://www.enfsi.eu/), a subset of technologies to be brought at TRL 8;
Phase 1: To prepare the tenders packages for calls for tenders to build prototypes of a toolkit integrating the above-mentioned subset of technologies, that can be used across Europe; To develop EU-wide benchmarks and validation methods for forensic technologies;
Phase 2: To implement the calls for tenders to generate 2 prototype toolkits from 2 different sources;
Phase 3: To benchmark and validate the 2 toolkits against the methods developed during Phase 1;
Phase 4: To draft a curriculum for pan European training in forensic technologies, and to plan for its assessment across Europe; to initiate the EU-wide certification of the toolkits based on the results of Phase 3.
For grants awarded under this topic SEC-09-FCT-2017, beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming to ensure exploitation of its results:

Research undertaken in recent years has proposed innovative approaches for the detection of precursors of explosives, drugs, and more generally speaking substances threatening the security of the citizens. Such approaches often require the installation of networks of sensors throughout urban areas. Utility networks, which are well developed in such areas, could be both sources of information through the analysis of the substance that they transport/provide (e.g. energy consumption, characteristics of used waters) or of their environment (e.g. quality of air, etc.). They can constitute networked (mobile) platforms for sensors, but this potential remains largely untapped.
Scope:
Proposals should address the deployment of detection systems in large and medium cities, in existing networks, or a combination of such networks, for instance for the detection of explosive precursors and illegal chemicals (drugs). Proposals shall address sewage networks and quality of air monitoring networks, and may address other networks. The experiment should last a significant period of time (at least two years).
Proposals should also provide for a mobile platform equipped to ascertain the composition and location of suspicious measurements, once data have been provided by the networked detection systems.
Proposals should provide for the prototype of a system controlling the detection systems and capable of fusing data provided by a variety of such networks, and of interfacing with other networks, pay particular attention to ethical issues raised when using such systems, and address the sustainability of such systems.
Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes. The complementarity of such synergies should be described comprehensively. On-going cooperation should be taken into account.
Proposers for this topic should look for an enhanced SME participation.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 to 8 for the sensors deployed; 6 for the control and information system, and the mobile platform; please see part G of the General Annexes.

Technologies and innovations in the field of CBRN are developed by SMEs or larger companies which often face difficulties in bringing them to markets: because they address local, small niche markets; or because these SMEs have neither the capabilities nor the strategic objective to go for foreign markets; or because the individual technologies that they develop can make it to the market only if integrated and combined with other tools by other companies that have the capabilities and the strategy to market its products abroad, and possibly on the global market.
Such synergies among companies are not frequent in the area of CBRN technologies, which is to the detriment of industrial competitiveness, and which limits considerably the offer made to the practitioners if one compares with the actual technological state-of-the-art.
Scope:
A CBRN cluster could articulate two kinds of actions:
Part a) (2016): A CSA supported by a ""complementary grant""[1] will gather the largest number of European companies capable and willing to market their products globally (e.g. companies producing integrated equipment for First Responder's, CBRN software systems, detectors, decontaminators, waste management and encapsulation equipment). The participants in the CSA will provide platforms (toolkits and systems in the field of CBRN) in which to integrate the technologies and innovations developed by other companies under Part B). They will develop interfaces with financial institutions potentially interested in the sector, including through InnovFin instruments and accompanying measures. [2] The CSA will issue a list of technologies that need to be developed with a view to integrating them into the platforms, possibly building upon the inventory developed by the EDEN project[3] once made public.[4]
The CSA will deliver the first version of the catalogue on time for use in the implementation of Part b). The participants in the CSA will provide commercial and other services enabling access to the global market for the results of the RIA selected for support under Part b). The CSA will report publicly on its discussions, and assess and provide feedback on the impact of the business deals implemented with the research and innovation activities led by SMEs under Part b) of this topic.
Part b) (2017): Several RIA aiming at research and development of novel CBRN technologies and innovations identified in the above-mentioned catalogue will be selected by the European Commission. Each of these actions will be led by an SME. Each consortium implementing such a RIA must not only establish a consortium agreement among its members, but also a collaboration agreement with the participants in the CSA supported through Part a). Such a collaboration agreement must settle how the results from the RIA will be exploited and integrated into platforms managed by the CSA.
The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 to 7 for the RIA under part b); please see part G of the General Annexes.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about € 2 million per action in 2016 and about € 3.5 million per action in 2017 would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The following options of the Model Grant Agreement will be implemented:
For grants awarded under this topic SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part a), beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming to ensure exploitation of its results: the CSA must commit to issue: at months 3 and 9 each year, during at least four years of activities, the catalogue of technologies mentioned in the scope of this topic and to make it available upon request; at month 6 each year, the reports of their discussions; and at month 12 each year, the above-mentioned assessment of impact. The respective option on additional exploitation obligations of Article 28.1 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
For grants awarded under this topic SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part b) option 1 of Article 41.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Grants awarded under this topic SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part a) will be complementary to the grant agreements under SEC-05-DRS-05-2016-2017 part b). The respective options of Article 2 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement[5] will be applied

Expected Impact:
Shorter time to market for novel CBRN technologies and innovations, and more business deals leading to industrial products of interest to more practitioners in Europe (and world-wide).
The larger the number of European companies involved in the CSA, the higher its impact will be.

Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Transport are part of an intermodal transportation system. In an intermodal transportation system, a passenger’s journeys consists of a succession of different transport modes, which depends on transport availability, but also on individual preferences regarding travel time, comfort, environmental impact and other criteria. Considering ATM as an integrated part of an intermodal transportation system will make it possible to optimize the performance of the overall transportation system and the complete door-to-door journey, instead of optimizing the individual modalities.
Seeing air transportation at the heart of an integrated, seamless, energy efficient, diffused intermodal system, Flightpath 2050 set the goal to allow travellers to reach their target destination within Europe within a maximum door-to-door time of four hours. Passengers should experience a seamless journey with full connectivity. In order to be able to reach these ambitious goals, a close collaboration between different transportation modes is required. A better understanding is needed on how ATM can better contribute to improve passenger’s intermodal journeys and how to increase the performance of the overall transportation system.
Scope:
Research activities should explore the connection and dependence between ATM/Air Transportation and other transport modes. Proposals should address the main barriers and identify how Air Transport, in particular urban and extended urban mobility, can evolve by efficiently connecting information and services with other transport modes to achieve the 4hr door to door ACARE goal and a seamless journey.
Proposals may investigate how sharing ATM information with other transportation modes or taking into account information from other transportation modes in ATM decision making could improve the individual journeys and the overall transportation systems.
Research activities may also investigate the legal feasibility and potential impact of introducing regulations aiming at optimizing the overall transportation system and allowing passengers to make informed choices, e.g. by proving more information on the environmental impact (carbon footprint, other emissions and noise) or by introducing a route charging scheme taking into account environmental criteria and the availability of other transportation modes for this route for defining the route charges.
Further, research activities may also study the feasibility of considering multimodal aspects (like the availability of modal choices) during all three phases of Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM) activities and analyse the potential impact on the performance of the overall transportation and passengers door-to-door journeys.
Proposals may explore the possibility of involving passengers in playing an active role in co-designing door-to-door services and generating data to incrementally define and improve new interconnected services following the approach of “participatory design”.
Proposal need to demonstrate their complementarity to activities launched by the European Commission and potentially other transport areas (i.e. rail, road, water) to ensure interoperability and delivery of harmonised services to realise cross-modal performance.
Activities are linked to ACARE action areas 1.1 (low carbon transport systems), 1.2 (design and implement an integrated, intermodal transport system) and 1.3 (door to door targets).
This topic is also linked with topic SESAR-ER4-25-2019 (ATM Performance) which aims at defining ATM performance indicators better capturing the ATM contribution to the performance of the transportation system.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to contribute to better integrate and connect ATM and air transportation with other modalities, to improve passenger experience during door-to-door journeys and in doing so, contribute to reaching the FlightPath2050 goals, in particular the 4h door-to-door target and the seamless journey."

Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) is one of the fundamental enablers of ATM as it supports locating and identifying air vehicles, and exchanging information with them.
The CNS services are currently delivered based on a network of technologies based on techniques which, for some of them, have been developed several decades ago and may not be as efficient as technologies being currently researched or in use in other domains.
Quality of services provided by the CNS network may suffer degradations (e.g. due to technical failures, external effects (e.g. solar storms), software issues, intentional or non-intentional disruptions (e.g. cyber-attacks)). As an example, availability is currently managed through redundancies which can have a significant cost.
The challenges to be addressed is to identify new technologies and/or configurations capable to provide the CNS services while also maintaining or improving the integrity, availability, performance and quality of these services whilst avoiding unnecessary cost and the perception of over-engineering the solutions.
Scope:
More modern techniques and technologies which are under research in contexts other than aviation shall be investigated to consider their relevance for ATM communication, surveillance or navigation domains or to combination of these domains as they may have the capabilities to unlock unforeseen possibilities.
Intelligent network management solutions shall also be investigated to ensure that the required quality of service by applying powerful network management techniques leading to cost-effective solutions.
During the research, it shall be considered that the population of air vehicles in the considered timeframe will drastically change integrating new types of flying objects (unmanned, orbital vehicles, flying cars) which all need to be considered as “clients” of the CNS services.
Research area 1: Application of new techniques and new technologies to provide CNS services
Communication, Navigation and Surveillance are not exclusively an ATM subject; they are also being researched and used in other domains.
The objective of this research area is to consider the relevance of new and innovative techniques and technologies, being researched outside the ATM, which could support localisation of air vehicles, acquiring their position and allowing exchange of information while maintaining, as overarching principles, the upmost level of integrity and safety. A technique could support one or several CNS domains.
The research should address any potentially innovative technologies without limiting the research to technologies which are specifically being researched for the CNS/ATM; as a matter of example technologies such as laser could be explored or any other innovative techniques. In particular, the usage of techniques operating outside the spectrum currently used by aviation is encouraged.
Research shall address the integration, interoperability and openness of proposed solutions for the long term, exploiting synergies, reducing costs and optimising spectrum usage.
Research area 2: Intelligent CNS network
The objective of this research area is to address new ways of managing the CNS network through intelligent network management principles. In particular advanced techniques such as Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Neural network, etc. that could enable the network to reorganise or reconfigure in case the demand for service would significantly change in specific circumstances (e.g. a sudden increase in traffic in a specific region) or in case one or several components of the network are suffering deficiencies (e.g. technical failures, non-intentional adverse conditions (e.g. solar storm) or cyber-attacks).
Expected Impact:
Successful research in this topic will have the potential to generate high positive benefits for ATM in terms of resource efficiencies, improvements in security, increased safety and cost efficiency."

At capacity constrained airports, traffic demand can exceed the airport capacity (either at the runway, taxiway or apron) and, with the expected rapid growth in air traffic in the coming years, there will be an increasing number of capacity-constrained airports for significant periods of each day. This situation will become even more critical under adverse weather conditions. As a consequence, there is a need to find solutions to improve the efficiency of airport operations and their resilience in visually and/or challenging meteorological conditions. One of the potential areas of improvement aims at increasing the level of automation for supporting ATCOs and flight crews during the execution of their tasks. This would allow ATCOs to manage higher levels of airport throughput while at least keeping (if not improving) safety levels and to also allow flight crews to execute their tasks more efficiently. The research activities under this theme support of the Airports Council International (ACI) vision for the digital transformation of the airport business.
Scope:
The scope of this topic covers the following aspects:
Application area 1: Advanced HMI interactions for tower controllers
This application area covers the development of new human machine interface (HMI) interaction modes and technologies in order to minimise the load and mental strain on the Tower controllers (especially under high traffic density situations, low visibility conditions, etc.).
The proposed applications shall go beyond or be complementary to those that are being addressed in Industrial Research (IR) solutions PJ.16-04 (Wave 1): multi-touch input (MTI) devices, use of in-air gestures, automatic speech recognition (ASR), attention guidance (AG), user profile management systems (UPMS) and use of virtual and augmented reality in different means and tracking labels. The output of PJ.16-04 is expected to be made public at the end of 2019; proposals for work in this area should plan effort to review this output and plan to incorporate it in their research if it is relevant. Note that it is expected that IR work continues as part of IR Wave 2 activities (Wave 2 candidate solution PJ.05-W2-97). Proposals should demonstrate how their work goes beyond the scope of the work planned for IR Wave 2 as described in the IR Wave 2 technical specifications.
Proposals must identify a specific improvement to operations and propose a plan to undertake its initial validation. The proposals must identify the technical enablers that are required for the proposed improvement. The work to be undertaken may include the development of the technical enabler, but cannot be limited to it, i.e. the research must include work towards the validation of how the enabler will be used. The operational validation needs to involve ATCOs.
The SJU has identified the following innovative HMI elements of interest:
The potential use of already developed technologies (e.g. for remote towers) in towered airports as well as the required adaptations to the specificities of these environments e.g. how to present to ATCOs tracking labels superimposed to their out-the-window view while avoiding information clutter;
The application of technologies in order to better integrate different information sources to reduce switching between head-up and head-down in the tower environment;
The potential application of emotion recognition, facial expressions, etc., in support of the optimization of human performance;
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms for the intelligent data provision to the controllers on the HMI (providing instead of “raw data”, information with context to ensure it is clear why data is being shown and what should be done based on the information presented, while avoiding information overflow). If addressing AI/machine learning, the research shall address the interaction, interplay, division, etc. of tasks and responsibility between ATCOs and algorithms as well as the deviations of ATCOs decisions from those suggested by the automated means e.g. AI.
The above list is not intended as prescriptive. Proposals for work in areas other than those listed above are welcome provided they include adequate background and justification.
Note that the proposed improvements may be applicable to current operations and/or to future operational concepts still under development by industrial research activities in SESAR.
The proposals must indicate the potential applicability of the proposed improvements in terms of categories of airports i.e. a given feature may be required for a major airport but not for a smaller one.
The proposals shall take into consideration relevant exploratory research projects such as MOTO, RETINA, etc.
Application area 2: Automation support to help flight crews on the airport surface
This application area addresses potential applications to improve the flight-crew performance during surface operations at the airport. In particular, this includes the development of on-board automation in support of a better integration with air traffic management for surface operations at the airports, such as:
Applications to inform the flight crew before the non-compliance takes place on the surface e.g. if approaching an intersection at high speed, etc. The warning/alert could be based upon different means e.g. input to aircraft controls, etc. Note that the aim of this application oriented concept is not conformance monitoring (covered in the following point);
Applications alert flight crews when they have deviated from ATC instructions (e.g. cleared route), from ATC procedures and/or from the airport configuration (AUO-0614 in the ATM Master Plan. This includes the autonomous generation of the appropriate conformance monitoring alerts by the on-board system on the basis of discrepancies detected between aircraft position and Airport Map Data Base and between aircraft position and clearances/instructions provided by ATC. Note that the ATM Master Plan operational improvement AUO-0614 is currently under research in IR by PJ3b, whose results are expected to be made publicly available at the end of 2019. Proposals for work in this area should explain how the proposed work would go beyond the IR scope, and plan effort to review the output of PJ3b and incorporate it in their work.
Enhanced arrival runway occupancy time thanks to efficient runway turn-off (AUO-0705 in the ATM Master Plan). The research shall address the combination of existing optimized braking to vacate solutions at a pre-selected runway exit with new applications for assisting the flight crew for achieving an efficient turn-off until aircraft has left runway protected area on the runway exit. This results in a reduced and more predictable arrival ROT. The expected reduced ROT and improved ROT predictability is relevant in good visibility conditions but it is even more so in low visibility conditions (especially in AUTO-LAND mode in CAT IIIb & c), where the observed arrival ROT is generally larger than in good visibility conditions. Proposals for work in this area must describe how they will go beyond previous SESAR 1 research in this area, referring in particular to the output of SESAR 1 project 06.08.02.The concept may be limited to the reduction, include an element of increased predictability of arrival ROT by ATC in the planning phase (e.g. equipped aircraft to indicate equipage or even prediction in seconds in flight plan), or even include an element of coordination with ATC in the execution phase (e.g. by aircraft downlinking predicted ROT to ATC around TOD or during the approach).
Enhanced departure runway occupancy time thanks to efficient line-up and take-off (AUO-0706 in the ATM Master Plan. The research shall address potential on-board applications to assist the flight crew of a departing aircraft for a more efficient (fast, accurate, reliable and safe) line-up and take-off. This optimised ROT, will result in a reduced and more predictable ROT at departure. The concept may be limited to the reduction of ROT, include an element of increased predictability of arrival ROT by ATC in the planning phase (e.g. equipped aircraft to indicate equipage or even prediction in seconds in flight plan), or even include an element of coordination with ATC in the execution phase (e.g. by aircraft downlinking predicted ROT to the tower ATC).
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms for the intelligent data provision to the flight crew (providing instead of “raw data”, information with context to ensure it is clear why data is being shown and what should be done based on the information presented, while avoiding information overflow) in support of reduced flight crew workload and increased safety during surface operations. If addressing AI/machine learning, the research shall address the interaction, interplay, division, etc. of tasks and responsibility between flight crew and algorithms as well as the deviations of flight crew decisions from those suggested by the automated means e.g. AI.
The above list is not intended as prescriptive. Proposals for work outside of these areas are welcome provided they include adequate justification and background.
The proposals shall assess the role of automation and its implications upon the role of the flight crew.
Application area 3: Automated apron and ground control
This research area aims at developing the operational concept for a highly automated apron management and manoeuvring area control at the airport. It shall address ground movement advisory service (apron) and/or control service (manoeuvring area). It is expected that clearance to enter/cross a runway, take off or land will still be delivered by a controller in all cases.
The research will work towards introducing a high-level of automation (corresponding to a Sheridan level of automation of 7 or more) for some or all of the following tasks:
Start-up approval;
Automatic push-back management;
Ground operations e.g. taxing, guidance from the gate to the runway, etc.; and/or
Detection of aircraft or vehicle movement, as well as of all other relevant objects, e.g. birds and debris on the runway, in order to ensure that the automation system has a situational awareness equivalent to o superior to what the human controller has in current operations, under all weather conditions, including low visibility;
The project may assume that the communication segment is solved by datalink or use voice communication (ATCO instructions sent using a combination of text-to-speech technology, pre-recorded messages, etc., and voice recognition to process incoming pilot communications). The research shall clearly identify their assumption in terms of datalink technologies and wireless communications.
The research must address fallback solutions in case of failure in the fully automated system. If the fallback requires human intervention, the relevant automation challenges must be considered (human-machine symbiosis).
The environment could be limited at small airports with less complex surface operations, and/or focused on airport with Remote Tower operations, but it could also be focused on increasing levels of automation at large airports (e.g. automatic start-up approval).
Proposals must explain how their research is positioned with respect to previous SESAR exploratory research projects in this domain MOTA, TACO and AUTOPACE, etc., but may choose a completely different approach provided they include adequate justification and background.
Expected Impact:
The proposed solutions under this sub-work area aim at:
Increasing airport capacity;
Improving cost efficiency (ATCO productivity);
Ensuring safety and security levels."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The airport is at the heart of the air traffic management system and any improvement in the airport operations will likely have positive results throughout the network. The specific challenge under this topic is exploring innovative ideas that help improving the following aspects:
Airports have been generally considered as pure air traffic management transportation nodes but there is a need to fully place them within their context as intermodal nodes in a larger multimodal transportation network. The transformation of the airport into an interchange node within a wider network imposes environmental, safety, security and financial challenges which differ from those of a single-mode node;
With the expected rapid growth in air traffic in the coming years, there will be an increasing number of capacity-constrained airports for significant periods of each day. There is a need to explore innovative solutions in order to deliver additional airport capacity. However, this must be done paying particular attention at maintaining the airports’ environmental sustainability.
The increasing number of drones is causing safety and security concerns within the aviation industry, in particular at the airports. A number of incidents involving drones at big airports in Europe have been already reported, and this number will likely increase in the coming future if nothing changes.
The research fully supports the vision for the digital transformation of airports put forward by ACI, contributing in particular to the evolution of processes and services to deliver a better experience to all passengers and customers, by adopting and implementing new technologies and integrating them with existing ones.
Scope:
The following non-exhaustive list of application areas of interest has been identified by the SJU:
Application area 1: Incorporation of Autonomous and Non-Autonomous Engine-off Taxiing into surface operations
The research shall propose potential solutions to incorporate autonomous and non-autonomous engine-off taxiing into surface operations and thus reduce fuel consumption and emissions and increase safety.
Taxi-out and Taxi-in phases can be done through:
Non-autonomous engine off taxiing (AUO-0806 in the ATM Master Plan) used from the gate to the holding point before line up (i.e. for push back and taxi out) and from the runway exit to the gate (i.e. for taxi in to in block). This may be realised with the aircraft using other external means to taxi (e.g. towing trucks, taxibot).
Autonomous engine off taxiing (AUO-0805 in the ATM Master Plan) used from the gate to the holding point before line up (i.e. for push back and taxi out) and from the runway exit to the gate (i.e. for taxi in to in block). This may be realised thanks to e.g. electric motors added to the main landing gear and drawing power from either the Auxiliary Power Unit or from an alternative cleaner power source (replacing the APU or being complementary to it) with central control from the cockpit.
The research shall provide an operational concept description and required operational procedures for performing autonomous and non-autonomous engine-off taxiing operations. Please note that the research must be focuses on the ATM aspects; non-ATM aspects of green taxi are covered by Clean Sky research. Important aspects that need research are the following:
For non-autonomous engine-off taxi, development of an operational concept, which must include the management of the tow fleet, including the parking space at the airport and the procedures to manage their operations, including communications between the tow vehicle’s management centre, ATC and the flight crews, and communication with the tow vehicle’s drivers in the case of manned tow vehicles.
For autonomous engine-off taxi, development of operational procedures for engine start-up during the taxi-out phase and shut-down during the taxi-in phase, development of minimum performance requirements for engine-off taxi, e.g. speed and acceleration required for smooth airport operations, quantification of the impact on airport operations of autonomous engine-off taxi, e.g. slower taxi operations, procedures for ATC to update the take-off clearance time during taxi-out for flight crews to be able to optimise engine start-up time, etc.
The research should not focus on providing initial quantitative benefits of the performance improvements related to environmental sustainability e.g. reduction of fuel consumption, decrease in CO2 and NOx emissions, reduced noise, improved safety, reduction of noise impact around the airport and safety (most FOD and blast damages are typically in the area close to the gate and engine off taxi could eliminate both risk), because these already exist. Instead, the research must provide a refinement of the previous estimates of benefits based on their work, for example:
Comparison of the airport and ATC costs of autonomous vs. non-autonomous engine-off taxi, e.g. by modelling costs in a particular airport.
Estimation of the impact of different potential safety and performance requirements on the benefits (e.g. requiring faster taxi performance would require more powerful on-board engines for non-autonomous engine-off taxi, engine start-up procedures requiring changes to airport lay-outs and slower taxi-out phase…
Impact on the benefits of the quality of the prediction of the ATC prediction of the take-off clearance time for engine start-up in autonomous engine-off taxi.
Note that the development of the technical means to perform engine-off taxiing operations e.g. towing trucks, taxibot, electric motors, etc. is out of the scope of the research topic. However, the research may work in the development of ATC system support for enabling engine-off taxi operations in the ATC side. However, the main focus of the research should not be the development of automation support, but the definition of the operational concepts for AUO-0805 and/or AUO-0806, in order to pave the way for their introduction in Industrial Research in the future if the research so justifies it.
Application area 2: Land-behind without runway vacated
The research shall address the development and validation of a European ""land behind without runway vacated"" concept.
Today, in the case of long runways, landing aircraft are allowed to use the runway simultaneously under certain circumstances, or the clearance to land may be delivered before the previous aircraft has crossed the threshold (similar to the FAA land behind clearance).
Note that this is not strictly a reduced wake separation concept, but a way to make it possible to take full advantage of reduced wake separation concepts for arrivals (the closer the arrivals are, the more constraining it is to require that the previous aircraft has landed before the next can be cleared to land).
The research shall take into consideration the work performed on reduced wake separation concepts for arrivals in Industrial Research (IR) solutions PJ.02-01 (Wave 1) and PJ.02-W2-14 (Wave 2).
Application area 3: Airport contribution to multimodality
The aim is to increase the efficiency of the overall transport chain by improving the interoperability of different modes of transport, addressing in particular the contribution of airports to multimodality to increase the environmental sustainability, to make more efficient use of the existing infrastructures and improve the passenger’s experience.
The research shall address the definition and development of an integrated intermodal process for passengers / baggage / freight w.r.t time efficiency, predictability, seamlessness, resilience, security, convenience, accessibility) in a door-to-door environment building on customer expectations. This may include:
The feasibility and potential benefits of connecting the schedules/time tables of public transport modes with access to the airport e.g. train, bus, metro, taxi with flight schedules. This should include the whole airport catchment area. Proposals could research the potential benefits of establishing standard coordination processes between airports scheduling and other public transportation modes e.g. bus, train, etc.
The improvement of knowledge regarding pax location and demand, incl. airport access and dwell times, thus ensuring a better and dynamic knowledge of passenger airport densities and delays;
The definition of the required technology and standards, information exchange requirements and data management technology to support integrated multimodal (passenger / baggage / freight) concept and process management;
The identification of infrastructure requirements for supporting multimodal processes for passengers / baggage / freight;
The identification of required regulations and policies regarding multimodal aspects of passenger / baggage / freight process (e.g. customs, security);
The development of innovative technologies and services for safe, efficient, frequent, comfortable airport access (last mile only or supporting catchment areas e.g. short distance individual air vehicles);
The development of intelligent systems – and better multimodal planning, management and integration (e.g. aps), incl. under disruption (e.g. re-booking onto HSR);
The improvement of improved aircraft wait/no-wait rules so AUs make better use of last-minute capacities and pax re-accommodation;
The identification of airborne pax connectivity requirements (links to ground services and pax tools);
The assessment of the Impact of multimodal pax rights and personal data security.
The research shall take into consideration the digital citizen perspective:
Assess the benefits for the traveller of an integrated planning/monitoring of multi-modal traffic flows at the airport (or the region) where the airport is considered as a node connecting traffic flows to/from other means of transport (e.g. rail, bus, etc.);
Provide advance warning of incidents impacting the traveller and propose alternative options to mitigate the disruption for the traveller plan.
Note that many of the aspects listed above are intentionally at the boundary of the scope of ATM. The proposals must justify how the proposed research will contribute to improve ATM or contribute to improve multimodal mobility by using ATM related information.
Proposals should explain how their research is positioned with respect to related previous and ongoing projects (e.g. BigDATA4ATM, DATASET2050, Mobility4EU and CAMERA and initiatives from other sectors contribution to multimodality (e.g. Shift2Rail Innovation Programme 4).
Application area 4: Protecting the airport from drones.
The research shall propose and assess potential solutions for ensuring the protection of the aircraft and airport (runway and ground) operations from intruder drones, which may be either intruding by mistake or through malicious intent. The performance objectives are related to improvements in safety and security
The research activities may address the following features:
The detection of any potential / actual intrusion by cooperative and non-cooperative drones in the airport environment and its vicinity e.g. approach area or any threat to the aircraft;
The tracking of the intruders' flight path;
Issuing the corresponding advisory, caution and warning alerts e.g. in case there is an intruder for the ATCO, in case active measures are needed to ensure safety, and for the airport authority, to allow them to initiate remedial action, as required (Note that the provision of warnings and alerts directly to the pilot of a manned aircraft is not in scope). Research should consider the different levels of alerts. For example, warning alerts could be triggered when the drone enters a critical zone while advisory and caution may be triggered when the drone enters a buffer area beyond the critical one (in case of a known, unintentional intrusion the drone operator could also receive an alert so he/she can take the relevant corrective action, either directly or through an appropriate U-space service provider);
Procedural issues to enable all stakeholders to work together to resolve the situation in a timely and coordinated fashion. Such stakeholders must include, as a minimum: the airport operator; ATC; U-space service provider(s); and the emergency and security services.
The research shall explore potential architectural and design alternatives that could include the following options (the list is not exhaustive):
The definition of how critical and any buffer areas are designed and warnings/alerts managed, within the wider context of aeronautical information management and airport operations management;
Sensors able to detect non-cooperative intruding drones and issue the relevant alert. Note that the development of such sensors is outside the scope of this Call, but research should consider the performance, system and interface requirements of such systems;
Use of geo-awareness to support the prediction and detection of unauthorised intrusions and to support the resolution of such intrusions and the identification of transgressing drone operators.
The scope of this application area does not include the development of the technologies (there are already technologies in the market that can be used for this purpose). The research must focus on the definition and initial validation of the operational integration of the system. The proposal must include the initial validation of the proposed operational concept in the airport environment. The proposed concept must include the integration with ATM, and the proposed validation activities must address the integration with TWR ATC. The research must include both a safety and a security assessment of the proposed solution to the level appropriate for the target maturity level, and also make a preliminary regulatory assessment.
Research may investigate the possibility of the employment of systems to disable, or bring down the drone, but the development of such systems themselves is explicitly outside of the scope of the project. Where such systems are considered, the safety of the airport environment, other aircraft and people and property on the ground must be assured. Consequently, the following factors must be taken into account:
The use of airport jammers or spoofers for the GNSS signal or other signals used for aviation purposes, or other devices such as lasers that have already been classified as dangerous by ICAO close to airports (since reflections can never be fully controlled), can only be considered if a detailed evaluation is also conducted showing how their employment can be deemed safe;
The potential use of such devices by law enforcement will need to follow specific procedures, and will require advance warning to appropriate aviation actors (ATM, pilots, etc…). This stipulation covers any device transmitting on aviation safety-of-life frequencies in the vicinity of an airport, or in an area where such use could interfere with aviation operations or systems.
The above list of applications areas is not intended to be exhaustive. Proposals addressing alternative application areas are welcome, provided adequate justification and background is included in the proposal.
Expected Impact:
The proposed solutions under this sub-work area aim at:
Ensuring safety and security levels;
Improving the interoperability of ATM with other modes of transport and finally the passenger’s experience;
Improving the airport environmental sustainability and capacity;
Increasing airport cost efficiency."

The network is not sufficiently robust or resilient to react to significant perturbations e.g. meteo, industrial actions, etc.; this imposes unplanned/additional costs on airlines, which have a huge impact on airlines’ annual revenue. Airspace users’ full participation through their flight operations centres (FOC/WOC) into ATM collaborative processes is essential to minimise impacts of deteriorated operations for all stakeholders, including airspace users themselves. An improved recovery process offering more flexibility to accommodate AUs’ changing business priorities and equity in the ATM system is therefore needed.
Scope:
As an applications oriented research topic, proposals must describe a specific improvement to operations and explain how it is proposed to undertake an initial validation. The improvement to operations can be either a new operational improvement or a new technical enabler (e.g. an improvement to traffic prediction and execution of the plan that would improve the performance of current network operations without changing the current network management procedures).
Proposals must demonstrate how their work would go beyond what is currently under research in IR in Wave 1 (PJ07, PJ08 and PJ09) and in Wave 2.
The scope of this sub-work area covers the following aspects:
Application area 1: Digital Network Management Operations
The research activities shall explore improvements to the Network Management (NM) function based on digital technologies such as:
The potential use of new data sources (big data), machine learning algorithms (including neural networks), AI based decision support tools, behavioural economics, improved market modelling, complexity science, etc. to support network operations e.g. models and methods for improving demand, flow and complexity forecasting and resolution;
The use of Big data analysis, machine learning and digital-twin techniques for better planning the actors (controllers, FMPs, AUs) reactions to potential operational improvements based on the emerging trends (e.g. incentives, etc.);
The development of methodologies to analyse, quantify and manage the effects of weather and other uncertainties on the network for all phases of flights and in particular on:
Trajectory planning (including MET forecasts evolving over time), aircraft performance, etc.;
Storm avoidance (including reduction of thunderstorm prediction uncertainty);
Sector demand and capacity balancing using the best available plan of action.
The better consideration of airport events in network traffic prediction that minimises network disruption;
Better consideration of the diversity in data quality from different ATC centres/airports and identify where improvements would bring the biggest gain for operations;
Innovative DCB resolution algorithms, e.g. using radically different algorithms to what is used today, e.g. building on previous exploratory research project OPTIFRAME or using alternative approaches, or working on fine-tuning today’s methods, e.g. by considering additional inputs.
The use of machine learning for:
The identification and prediction of: major traffic flows, complexity assessment, calibration of airspace/sector capacity, flight delays, estimated arrival and overflight times, etc. with the objective of reducing NM capacity buffers;
To improve the handling of AU priorities/preferences;
To improved disruption management;
The use of machine learning and/or advanced visual analytics for DCB decision support tools and automation e.g. hotspot resolution;
The adaptation of applications that use models/techniques that are already applied for uncertainty management in other domains.
The development of probabilistic approaches based on historical data mining techniques.
Application area 2: Improved Integration of Airline Operations into the Network
The research shall address potential improvements of airline operations based on the use of advanced digital technologies, e.g. big data, machine learning algorithms, AI, IoT, behavioural economics, improved market modelling, complexity science, etc. such as:
The potential use of new data sources (big data), machine learning algorithms, AI based decision support tools, etc. to support airline decision making in disruption scenarios in order to improve the resilience of the system;
The development of new tools for improving the integration of airline operations into the network, in order to mitigate the impact of disruptions on the overall ATM network and/or improving operations in nominal conditions (e.g. earlier update of TTOT, better adherence to TSAT, more accurate turn-around time planning, more accurate 4D trajectory calculation for the eFPL by using AI to improve predictions, etc.).
The identification of innovative applications to improve the collaboration between AOCs and Network management function and ATC, e.g. to support the involvement of AOC’s that track flights in trajectory revision, in particular for long-haul flights, or to facilitate the inclusion of airline preferences and priorities in the DCB processes or sequencing processes beyond what is already covered in IR Wave 1 and the scope of IR Wave 2 (candidates solutions 38, 39 and 40).
The research may build on previous SESAR ER projects using complexity science to better understand delay propagation (e.g. NEWO, TREE) or use entirely new approaches.
Application area 3: CASA Evolution
The Computer-Assisted-Slot-Allocation (CASA) algorithm is used by the Network Manager to allocate departure slots. The Airline Operator (AO) files a flight plan and requests a slot. NM takes into account all the regulation requests from FMPs and allocates some aircraft a delay for entering the regulated area based on the principle of ‘First Planned - First Served’. On this basis, the system calculates the Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT), which is transmitted to the concerned AOCs and to the control tower at the aerodrome of departure. On top of this basic process, there are a number of compensation mechanisms that take into consideration modifications to the flight plan, late received flight plans, etc., as well as for the cases when a flight crosses more than one regulated area.
Proposals shall include activities that propose areas for the evolution of the current CASA and constraints reconciliation algorithm and slot allocation processes in order to improve efficiency and reduce the adverse impact of multiple regulations affecting the same flight or flows, e.g. by finding less constraining ways to handle flights that cross several regulated areas than the current most penalising regulation criterion., or facilitating a more collaborative approach between ANSPs by better allocating CASA delay minutes between ANSPs in the case of regulations that are not formally linked.
Proposals must demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the CASA baseline and explain how they plan to assess the potential benefits of the proposed evolutions against it; the use of a non-regulated scenario as reference for comparison is not acceptable.
The research may include the use of big data and machine learning to identify best practices regarding regulation strategies for particular traffic load patterns based on historical data. The analysis of historical data on regulation strategies should be complemented by the results from network simulations to develop optimized strategies for the most frequent traffic load situations in the European ATFCM network.
The research may build on previous SESAR ER research (e.g. OPTIFRAME) or propose entirely new approaches. Please note that PJ09 results are expected to become publicly available at the end of 2019. Projects planning to work in this area must reserve effort for analysing PJ09’s output and incorporate it in their research. Please note also that proposals must show how they go beyond the IR Wave 2 scope of candidate solution 47.
Application area 4: More automated ATFCM
The research shall identify mechanisms to allow the introduction of higher levels of automation in the coordination of DCB actions at the pre-tactical and tactical levels.
Expected Impact:
The proposed solutions under this topic aim at improving:
Safety, thanks to better anticipating and managing demand-capacity imbalances;
Robustness and resilience of the network to perturbations;
Efficiency thanks to a better monitoring of the DCB measures and network performance and the implementation of corrective actions;
Cost-efficiency: an improved network management will allow better planning of ATM resources, as well as making better use of existing capacities, which would lead to reduced ATC and airport costs;
Flexibility: common awareness to all stakeholders of the network situation and access to opportunities in case of late changes in capacity or demand."

This topic covers innovative network management application concepts that aim at responding to emerging business needs that can only be addressed by the increased collaboration between stakeholders that is made possible by implementation of new technologies.
Scope:
Proposals for this topic must propose an innovative improvement to operations and a plan to undertake its initial validation. The analysis of data without proposing an improvement to operations is out of scope for this topic.
The following potential application areas of interest have been identified by the SJU:
Application area 1: Improvement of ATFM processes by including the consideration of convective weather information
The post-operations analysis of re-routing choices made by flight crews or airline operations (when flight-planning) when the weather situation is non-nominal (e.g. convective weather) may provide valuable information for improving how similar convective weather events are managed in the future. The objective is to anticipate the changes in demand in non-nominal weather situations, and to define scenarios and CDM processes for the management of similar situations. Proposals proposing to work in this area must demonstrate that the research activities will have access to sufficient historical information of re-routing choices to perform the initial validation of the concept.
Application area 2: Increasing the use of middle airspace
The “middle airspace” (approximately between 15.000 ft. and 25.000 ft.) is for the most part not used for cruising, except by aircraft with gas-turbine-powered propellers (turboprops), which represent a relatively low proportion of the fleet. The research should identify the extent to which the use of the middle airspace would provide benefits in terms of reducing ATFM delay minutes at ECAC level, and make an assessment of the business case for providing ATFM slots for flights in the middle airspace considering the potential increased fuel and environmental impact against the savings in terms of delay minutes. The research may propose changes to the route charging scheme in support of the business case, as well as other incentivization methods to encourage the use of turboprop vs. jet engines for the busiest routes. The impact that incentivizing the use of aircraft with smaller capacity on routes with high demand in airport operations must be considered (more flights needed to move the same number of passengers).
Application area 3: Innovation in route-charging schemes
Previous exploratory research in SESAR (projects COCTA and SATURN) has shown the potential of new trajectory pricing schemes to support a more flexible distribution of the demand. Proposals addressing this area may build on these previous research, or propose additional innovative schemes, e.g. lower charges in periods of low demand, discounts for early flight planning with route commitment (in order to promote the SESAR SBT concept and enable better ANSP resource planning), overcharge for changes after filing flight plan, etc. Research may also look into charging schemes that consider environmental penalties or rebates, e.g. higher charges for flights filing flight-plans with longer routes than necessary.
Application area 4: Consideration of airport departure slots in ATFM
This application area looks into the development and initial validation of a concept for the consideration of airport departure and/or arrival slots as an input parameter to the network TT and slot allocation processes, beyond the indirect consideration of airport arrival slots what is enabled through the AOP participation in TT allocation processes. Proposals must demonstrate awareness of previous research in this area and the reasons why previous concepts did not progress to implementation. As well as changes to the ATFM processes to improve the consideration of airport slots, the research may propose the refinement of the airport slot allocation concept and/or associated monitoring processes in order to increase their relevance to ATFM (e.g. consideration of TMA capacity in slot allocation processes, addition of tolerance values associated to airport slot compliance, detection of unrealistic planning of departure and arrival times resulting in non-compliance of airport slots, etc.).
Application area 5: Development of a trajectory broker concept
Proposals should describe a trajectory broker concept and propose a plan for the initial validation of the potential benefits. The objective is to add a brokering layer to make better use of available capacity in all phases of ATFM operation (strategic, pre-tactical, tactical) and in all areas (airport, TMA, en-route). Proposals should not only look at the technical aspects but also take into account necessary regulatory/organisational changes. The concept should either build on previous Exploratory Research in project COCTA or propose alternative approaches. Proposals for research that does not build on COCTA should explain how they diverge from COCTA and provide adequate justification and background.
The above list of application areas is not intended as prescriptive; bids proposing to work in other areas are welcome, provided adequate background and justification are provided in the proposal.
Expected Impact:
Improved network management will result in an overall performance improvement in ATM."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In today’s operations, the available airspace configuration options are limited and not necessarily able to manage the traffic demand efficiently. If the ACCs cannot cope with the demand, then additional sectors are opened. In addition, due to the uncertainty in traffic demand, ACCs normally keep a capacity buffer to be able to safely manage traffic above the expected demand. Airspace configurations are selected with a focus on the local benefit rather than considering the network as a whole. The current airspace organisation is not yet fully optimised to network flows and makes limited use of cross-FIR cooperation.
The challenge is to develop a fully dynamic and cross-border airspace management concept that will take into consideration all capacity/demand aspects and constraints in one seamless process, with a higher level of modularity and flexibility up to the execution phase all supported by automated tools. The outcome of this will be a process that is able to take all the available inputs into consideration (predicted workload/complexity, airspace reservations, ATCO availability, etc.) and calculate the optimum configuration.
The research in this area contributes to the vision put forward in the Airspace Architecture Study (AAS).
Scope:
This area of work is complementary to the work of PJ07 and PJ08 in SESAR IR Wave 1 and to the work covered by Wave 2 candidate solution 44, Dynamic Airspace Configuration, and is of special interest for the realisation of the vision put forward in the Airspace Architecture Study (AAS). Proposals must demonstrate awareness of the work covered in IR, and show how their work would go beyond. Projects must reserve effort to analyse and incorporate into their work the output of PJ07 and PJ08, which is expected at the end of 2019.
The following potential areas of application beyond IR have been identified by the SJU:
Application area 1: Dynamic Mobile Areas (DMA) Type 3
The concept of an ARES that moves along with the military aircraft whose mission requires an airspace reservation (DMA Type 3, AOM-0209) is part of the European ATM Master Plan. The original DMA Type 3 high-level concept was based on a pre-departure agreement of the DMA Type 3 4D dimensions during the planning phase. The concept is currently under initial development in IR Wave 1 by PJ.08-02, but due to the low maturity of the concept it has been decided that more ER is needed before IR can continue, and therefore DMAs type 3 will not be addressed in IR Wave 2.
The SESAR concept has evolved as a result of R&D and the possibilities opened up by advanced digital technologies. Advanced automation will allow a more dynamic and flexible management of air traffic, thereby making penalising pre-departure agreements less necessary. The challenge is to define how the original DMA Type 3 objective can be fulfilled in this more dynamic context. The expectation is that some military missions can be managed by defining a volume of protected airspace around the moving military aircraft operating under Operational Air Traffic rules (OAT), instead of requiring an ARES. The size of the protected volume would be specific for each aircraft type and mission (e.g. fighter, tanker, re-fuelling, formation...). The research should investigate the potential of this concept to reduce the need for ARES in the busy European airspace, by providing an in depth assessment of the types of military missions that may be handled in this way and quantify if there are potential benefits in further pursuing the DMA Type 3 concept.
Proposals for work in this area must demonstrate access to military stakeholders and describe how they plan to gather information to answer the research question. The output of the research should be a recommendation to either discard the DMA Type 3 concept or recommend its inclusion in the ATM Master Plan with a new refined definition. Proposals should include effort to review the output of PJ.08-02 (expected to be publicly available at the end of 2019) and incorporate it in their work.
Application area 2: Fully Dynamic Airspace beyond Industrial Research
Dynamic Airspace Configurations is currently in the scope of Wave 1 IR PJ08, and it is expected to continue in Wave 2 (Wave 2 candidate SESAR solution 44). Proposals may address DAC aspects beyond the scope of Wave 2 IR, for example:
Explore the integration in the DAC process of areas that are potentially unsafe due to weather phenomena that can evolve in four dimensions (moving hazard zones). The research shall explore the possibility to extend these hazard areas due to other phenomena such as volcanic ash, etc.
Define the required mechanisms to build adequate airspace configurations all along tactical operations (the IR scope is currently focused mainly on the planning phase).
Moving hazard areas.
Proposals in this application area should plan effort to review and integrate the output of PJ.08-02 (expected to be publicly available at the end of 2019) and incorporate it in their work.
Expected Impact:
The proposed solutions under this sub-work area aim at improving:
Capacity: a fully dynamic airspace allows a better use of available ATC capacity and a better balancing of ATC workload leading to reduced demand/capacity imbalance;
Cost-efficiency: fully dynamic airspace allows improved ATM resource planning and better use of existing capacities leading to reduced ATC costs
Environment sustainability: increased efficiency enabling optimised flight trajectories and profiles with the end result being reduced fuel burn, noise and CO2 emissions;
Flexibility: fully dynamic airspace allows increasing the flexibility of airspace configurations to adapt to any change of demand pattern or unexpected change of user’s trajectory intents."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Weather has a significant impact on airport operations: snow, sleet, and freezing rain, which along with strong winds, low clouds, and reduced visibility may create dangerous conditions at or around an airport. These weather conditions can result in major disruptions in air traffic management, leading to delays and cancellations of hundreds or thousands of flights, thus affecting the plans of millions of travellers. Continuous development of weather forecasting solutions and technologies is paramount if airports are to cope with the rising passenger demand.
Scope:
The scope of this topic covers the following aspects:
Application area 1: From Runway Visual Range (RVR) to Slant Visual Range (SVR).
The Runway Visual Range (RVR) is the distance over which a pilot of an aircraft on the centreline of the runway can see the runway surface markings delineating the runway or identifying its centre line. RVR (normally expressed in feet or meters) and has been in use for decades. By providing RVR information, pilots can appraise aerodrome visibility conditions and in particular determine whether these conditions are above or below the company, aircraft or aerodrome operating minima. RVR does not take into consideration important variables e.g. reduced visibility from other factors such as rain on the windshield of the aircraft.
The objective is to conduct research on what is necessary to complement the RVR with the Slant Visual Range (SVR), also known as Slant Runway Visibility. SVR is defined as the slant distance to the farthest high intensity runway edge light or approach runway light which a pilot will see at an altitude of 100 ft. (decision height) on the approach path or, if larger, the slant distance which would have a constant transmittance of 5.5 percent. The research shall investigate the potential operational benefits of providing a measured SVR to pilots in support of their own visual assessment of the visibility conditions, with the objective of improving safety and reducing the number of missed approaches caused by unexpected low visibility and/or the number of unnecessary diversions in borderline meteorological conditions. The research may assess the advantages and disadvantages of different technical means to provide SVR e.g. use of the information from LIDAR installed along the glide path, monostatic acoustic radars, etc., provided that the development of technical means to measure SVR is justified by the operational need.
The proposal may include data collection campaigns, in which the SVR measurements obtained by one or more technical solutions are compared against what a pilot actually sees during the operations, etc. In this case, the analysis of the data must include an estimation of the number of prevented missed approaches and unnecessary diversions, as well as an assessment of the impact on safety.
Application area 2: Windshear and turbulence data prediction on approach:
The research objective is to define and perform initial validation of a concept to share from ground to cockpit predictions of windshear and turbulence on approach (with a focus on final approach) based on pilot reports, ground measurements, or a combination of both. The research must provide an initial analysis of the potential safety benefits of the concept, as well as of its cost.
Note that SESAR solution #21 “Airport operations plan (AOP) and its seamless integration with the network operations plan (NOP)” includes already technical specifications for the ground WX monitoring system for airports, and SESAR solution #35 “Meteorological information exchange” covers technical specifications for observation systems for significant low level turbulence and windshear. Proposals for work in this area must explain how their work would fit within and complement these two solutions.
Expected Impact:
The proposed solutions under this topic aim at improving airport capacity and resilience and ensuring safety and security levels."

This topic looks at the development of innovative concepts air traffic services with the objective of enabling the extension of air traffic services beyond what is possible today.
The evolution of demand for new kind of operations made possible by new technologies requires air traffic services to evolve accordingly. This topic develops applications to cater to emerging challenges and opportunities, like the advent of very-high level operations, the need to respond to the demand for civilian formation flying, or the reduced dependence on the magnetic compass for navigation.
Scope:
The objective is for the exploratory research projects to support the development of the concept of operations, rather than the enablers required to support it. The link to the European ATM Master Plan must be addressed.
The following two innovative areas of interest have been identified by the SESAR Joint Undertaking:
Application area 1: ‘Higher airspace’ operations
Demand for use of very high-level airspace has increased in the last years, and this trend is expected to gain momentum in the coming years. ICAO has provisionally adopted the term ‘higher airspace’ to refer to that volume of airspace between airspace where ATM provides services (typical upper level of FL600) and the boundary between airspace and space (approximately 100 km). AU operating in this airspace are sometimes referred to as ‘New Entrants’, and have many different operating characteristics, such as unmanned HALE vehicles providing internet coverage or surveillance over large areas and Unmanned Free Balloons (UFB), as well as manned sub-orbital flights for leisure or scientific purposes (e.g. experiments, films or tourism at zero gravity) and supersonic or hyper-sonic passenger aircraft. This volume of airspace will, therefore, be used by all classes of air vehicle, from static, barely manoeuvrable unmanned balloons, through high-speed passenger aircraft to rapidly-climbing rockets.
Although State and commercial space launchers will transit this volume of airspace, space operations, or ‘space traffic control’, are not in the scope of this topic. However, research should reflect that higher airspace is capable of allowing such operations to proceed without undue hindrance to them, and without adversely affecting the safety of higher-airspace vehicles.
The management of higher airspace is only just being considered by ICAO, and even its vertical boundaries are, as yet, undefined. The exploitation of space is a politically very sensitive issue and so research into this topic, at the boundary with space, should consider, inter alia, political sensitivities, operational concepts and CNS issues, while performing a thorough, global analysis of operational and business needs.
Proposals need to plan effort for:
Ad-hoc participation in the European Commission New Entries working group.
Developing the European Concept of Operations for Higher-Airspace operations, or supporting its development if such an initiative has already commenced in the context of the European Commission New Entries working group.
Addressing the link with the European ATM Mater Plan and the SESAR Concept of Operations.
Proposals addressing this application area must plan the following milestones:
A public deliverable should be delivered to the SJU 12 months after the start of the project describing the current global demand for higher-airspace operations, how States and businesses are addressing it, and their interface with space agencies and operations, with the aim of generating a detailed picture of demand, barriers, opportunities and possibilities. This deliverable should be presented in a public event with the objective of collecting feedback on how this demand can be best addressed.
A public deliverable with the report of the project’s analysis of the feedback collected during the event with recommendations for further work in the area should be delivered 14 months after the start of the project.
The work in the last ten months of the research activities should be focused on developing or supporting the development of the European Concept of Operations for Higher-Airspace operations, potentially including in-depth concept development to address one or more of the challenges that are specific to high-level operations.
Application area 2: Moving from magnetic to geographic bearings
Even though the magnetic compass is not as essential to navigation as it used to be, magnetic bearings are still the main reference in aeronautical charts and runway markings, and all aircraft feature magnetic deviation plates, and changes of deviation require periodic update of charts, plates and runway markings. It has been suggested that moving to geographic bearings may enable significant cost savings, and also be advantageous for operations in polar routes, for which demand has already increased and is expected to continue to do so. The research challenge is to investigate whether this would be a feasible alternative in the medium- to long-term future, and if so identify the operational changes that would be required and perform an initial high-level identification of the potential benefits.
Please note that this list of innovative areas is not intended as prescriptive; bids addressing alternative areas of innovation in air traffic services are welcome, provided adequate justification and background are provided in the bid.
Proposals must demonstrate operational knowledge of current operations, familiarity with the aspects of the SESAR concept of operations that will be impacted by the innovative concept and an understanding of the innovative concept and the related state-of-the-art.
It is expected that the development of the new concept of operations will need to start with an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art through literature review and interviews to relevant experts, followed by workshops with experts and stakeholders to discuss the future operational concept. The conduct of model-based simulations should neither be the main objective of the project nor take most of the effort, limited model based simulations may be used if adequately justified, e.g. to support quantification of benefits of formation flying.
The output of the project must be a high-level concept of operations describing an innovative air traffic service application. The objective of the concept of operations is to provide a vision of how the innovative concept will work within the current system and how it will change the operations from the point of view of all stakeholders. By its nature, the final concept of operations deliverable must be public. It is expected that intermediate deliverables supporting the development of the concept of operations (e.g. literature reviews, reports of workshops or interviews) will usually also be marked as public unless there is a specific reason for not doing so. Proposal including any deliverables as confidential are strongly advised to provide adequate justification for the need for confidentiality.
Expected Impact:
Research in innovative Air Traffic Services concepts will support the development of the SESAR concept of operations in support of the objective of the ATM Master Plan and ACARE Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Increasing the level of automation in air traffic control is a key enabler for the realization of the Master Plan vision. This topic explores automation applications for air traffic control beyond what is currently covered by the Industrial Research programme.
The exploratory research challenge is to bring new automation applications for air traffic control towards the maturity level required for their inclusion in the industrial research programme. Bids should describe their proposed application and outline a plan for the project to undertake its initial validation, with the objective of at the end of the research activities being able to make a recommendation to either propose its inclusion in the European ATM Master Plan or discard it.
Scope:
Proposals submitted for this topic should clearly describe an automation application concept for the en-route or TMA air traffic control position and describe what the expected benefits are and how they will undertake its initial validation. Please note that applications for the automation of air traffic management tasks other than the air traffic control position (e.g. Flow Management Position, improvement of traffic prediction algorithms for flow management purposes) are out of the scope of this topic. Applications for the air traffic control positions used to improve controller training are in scope.
The following non-exhaustive list of potential candidate application areas has been identified as being of interest by the SESAR Joint Undertaking:
Application area 1: Advanced automation support for en-route and TMA
Advanced automation support currently under development in the Wave 1 SESAR industrial research programme include use of multi-touch inputs, use of speech recognition to reduce the amount of typing for entries into the ground system required from controllers, attention control elements to measuring the level of attention (e.g. by measuring eye movement) and use of User Profile Management Systems (UPMS) for controller identification that use iris, speech recognition, finger print authentication or face recognition. Results of this research are expected to become publicly available at the end of 2019, and more research is planned for the Wave 2 IR programme (candidate SESAR solution 96). Proposals for work in this topic must demonstrate how they go beyond the scope of the work planned for Wave 2 IR. Examples of potential areas for exploratory research are: exploration of the use of machine learning to model and be able to anticipate controller behaviour and pre-fill entries into the ground system or CPDLC messages, advanced context-sensitive information presentation concepts, use of 3D representations, etc.
Application area 2: On-screen presentation of MET data to ATCOs
Combining ground-based meteorological radar information with data downlinked from aircraft’s on-board weather radar can provide high-quality weather information with granularity in both the vertical and the horizontal domain. This information would be very useful for controllers, because it would make it possible to anticipate how aircraft are likely to be requesting deviation from their horizontal or vertical route to avoid areas of weather activity. However, the on-screen presentation to controllers of detailed weather information is challenging, due to the need to avoid screen clutter and information overload on screen. The research may explore information presentation concepts, which may be context dependent, e.g. present only information relevant to the traffic that the controller is handling, or even present only an indication of which aircraft are likely to deviate and offer alternative courses to controllers, e.g. for vectoring arrivals and departures around weather activity in the TMA. Research in this area must be focused on the definition of the operational application; it should define the high-level requirements of the meteorological prediction process needed to support it. Bids on this topic proposing to work focused on improvement of the meteorological prediction processes rather than on its operational application are out of scope.
Application area 3: Applications of physiological measurements
Previous SESAR exploratory research work (projects STRESS, NINA, 6th SENSE, MINIMA) has shown that there is a potential for applying physiological measurements to air traffic control, e.g. measuring of brain waves to assess the level of attention, use of speech recognition combined with physiological measurements to monitor stress, correlation of eye-movement patterns with the occurrence of events that are potentially safety relevant. Please note that this is an applications-oriented topic, and consequently bids must propose a specific application. Bids may build on previous SESAR exploratory research or propose entirely new applications. All bids, whether proposing applications new to SESAR or building on previous SESAR research, must provide adequate background information in their proposal.
Application area 4: Automated ATC in low-density en-route airspace
Previous research shows the potential of using supervised learning to model some of the functions of an air traffic controller and can be used for training and task analysis purposes. IR solution PJ.16-04 is also developing ATCO task modelling in support of advanced HMI applications for ATC, and their results are expected to become publicly available at the end of 2019. This application area should explore if it is possible to build on this idea and develop and perform preliminary validations (TRL0 to TRL1) of a concept to automate ATC for high-level en-route sectors.
This concept may foresee that controllers have to intervene in certain situations, e.g. when two aircraft are anticipated to get closer than a pre-defined distance or below a certain flight level, but controllers can’t be expected to be able to be able to safety intervene if requests to intervene are for last-minute critical situations that can’t be handled by the automatic system. The role of the human would need to be carefully assessed in order to ensure that it is fully consistent with human capabilities. In particular, it is expected that in this application the controller should not be required to monitor the automated system, because this may create a safety issue; instead, the monitoring task must also be automated. Adaptable and adaptive automation concepts may be useful in support of optimised human performance and safety. Additionally, high automation may lead to the potential risk associated to monotony and boredom, and the concept should foresee measures to address this risk.
The research must address fallback solutions in case of failure in the fully automated system.
The concept would need to take into consideration the take-over procedure by the ATCO (automatic ATC-to-human ATC transfer process). ATC system–pilot communications may need to be adapted for this application, e.g. it might be necessary to notify pilots that the flight is being handled under automatic ATC, and a special call mechanism to require human controller intervention might be needed. The role that voice communications should play must be established (i.e. should the automatic ATC always send clearances via datalink, or would it be appropriate that some clearances be sent using synthetic voice?).
It is anticipated that voice communications check-in would still be necessary for all flights to ensure that they are immediately contactable via R/T at all times. The concept should determine whether the check-in on R/T would need to be handled by a human controller or it could also be handled by the automatic system. The concept may consider current datalink performance and messages or define more advanced datalink requirements.
It is expected that the R&D and eventual implementation of such an application may not have significant benefits in itself, but would provide invaluable operational experience in support of future more ambitious developments in ATC automation. Proposals should plan effort to analyse whether It may be possible to realise benefits in the short to medium term from this research though related concepts, e.g. though applications in ATCO training.
Application area 5: Clear air turbulence data consideration
According to IATA, turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to airline passengers and crews globally. Flight crews routinely report clear air turbulence to controllers, who, workload permitting, relay turbulence reports with aircraft that will be overflying the same area. However, controller workload may not always allow for controllers to properly relay this information. In order to overcome this limitation, the IATA turbulence Aware Platform allows this information to be automatically shared between pilots and AOCs. However, this initiative does not include the sharing of information with ATC, while turbulence information is also relevant for controllers, e.g. because it can support proactive management of level change requests or raise awareness of potential speed changes. An application could be developed to either connect ATC to an ongoing sharing initiative or to develop a complementary system for sharing turbulence reports between aircraft and ATC. The research must consider how controllers would be presented the information and how they would use it. New system support concepts may be proposed to assist controllers in effectively taking into consideration clear air turbulence information. The output of this project should be the definition of a concept for inclusion in the ATM Master Plan, with one or more operational improvements and enablers.
Application area 6: Standardization of ATCO procedures and more generic en-route controller validations
The amount of training required for en-route controllers to get endorsed in a sector is a limiting factor for controller mobility; in addition, the number of hours that are required to stay current in a sector limits the number of sectors that they can be endorsed for, which makes the controllers’ work more tedious (always working on the same sectors, same callsigns, etc.), and also makes efficient rostering harder for the ANSP. Applications to provide on-the-job support to controllers on local knowledge may alleviate this situation and support the controllers in accepting delegation of airspace as outlined in the Airspace Architecture Study (Airspace Architecture Study (AAS) (virtual centre / delegation of airspace / capacity on demand). Some basic applications are already locally implemented today, e.g. applications that check transfer conditions against LOAs or provide on-demand AIP information on the screen. However, the local knowledge required to control a sector includes a lot more than remembering AIP information. In particular, the exploratory research challenge is to provide difficult to define information items, e.g. information that would make a controller recognize a situation as unusual even though it is not against the established procedures, like unusual incoming or outgoing transfer condition, unusual vertical profile, etc. This type of information is an important part of what controllers learn during sector-specific on-the-job training and it may evolve with time. Bids may propose applications to capture this type of soft sector-specific rules and display it to controllers when it is relevant, e.g. using machine learning for detection of unusual situations that a controller who is inexperienced in a sector should be warned about, analysis of recordings of training sessions where veteran controllers are taught how to work in a new sector (i.e. they are learning the sector rather basic air traffic control skills), etc. Special care to avoid information overload must be taken.
Please note that applications outside these areas may also be proposed provided adequate justification and background is provided in the proposal.
Expected Impact:
Increasing the level of automation in en-route and TMA ATC is a key aspect for the realisation of the digital aviation vision put forward in the European ATM Master Plan. Its expected performance benefits are increased controller productivity and increased safety."

The current ATM environment based on static flight plans is evolving towards a trajectory based environment in order to improve airports and ATM network performance. Airspace users’ (AU) decision processes and resulting business priorities differ from AU to AU and from flight to flight within one AU. The trajectory development and management processes in ATM currently do not allow each individual user to incorporate specific aircraft/flight priorities into the requested trajectory, and respect any constraint in a way that best meets the business priorities. Similarly, OAT flight plans are not harmonised at European level and information is not disseminated into the network, this induces a lack of awareness about military traffic intentions that can impact ATM network performance (including safety), a lack of flexibility in the definition of cross-borders exercises and limitations in terms of interoperability. Irregular operations impose unplanned/additional cost on airlines and have a huge impact on airlines’ annual costs and revenue. Today the ATM system allows little flexibility to airspace users (e.g. ATFM slot swapping process). Airspace users’ full participation through their flight operations centres (FOC/WOC) into ATM collaborative processes, including flights’ prioritisation with the full user driven prioritisation process (UDPP), is essential to minimise impacts of deteriorated operations for all stakeholders including airspace users. A better recovery process that should offer more flexibility to accommodate AUs’ changing business priorities and equity in the ATM system. The collaborative planning and flight execution processes shall be performed at ‘level playing field’, i.e. performance of all actors is taken into consideration. Rules must be implemented in case no collaborative planning is possible.
Scope:
The topic ‘Optimised airspace users operations’ covers the following candidate SESAR Solutions:
Solution PJ.07-W2-38 Enhanced integration of AU trajectory definition and network management processes.
The objective of this solution is to reduce the impact of ATM planning on Airspace Users’ costs of operations, by providing them a better access to ATM resource management and allowing them to better cope with ATM constraints. The solution shall improve Airspace Users flight planning and network management through improved FOC participation into the ATM network collaborative processes in the context of FF-ICE and its potential evolutions.
Solution PJ.07-W2-40 Mission trajectories management with integrated Dynamic Mobile Areas Type 1 and Type 2.
The objective of the solution is to improve the use of airspace capacity for both civil and military users and the efficiency of airspace management by introducing more automation and increased flexibility in the civil-military coordination. The solution delivers improvements to the planning phase of the mission trajectory, including the connection of MT management with the booking of ARES (in the context of this solution DMA Type 1 and Type 2), for which the WOC will be the key actor. The coordination between WOC and regional NM is a key element for this solution.
Solution PJ.07-W2-39 Collaborative framework managing delay constraints on arrivals.
The solution develops a collaborative framework that will enable the integration and necessary coordination of 4D constraints from various stakeholders (airports, ANSPs, AUs and NM). This will ensure the continued stability and performance of the network and will give the opportunity to the Airspace Users to prioritize their most important flights hence reducing the impact of ATM planning constraints on the costs of their operations. The solution will streamline all prioritisation processes occurring in the planning phase from all stakeholders concerned on arrivals.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Increased capacity based on a better integration of the AUs trajectory definition and the network demand and capacity function
Increased flexibility by allowing the airspace users to recommend to the network management function a priority order for flights;
Environmental sustainability - fuel efficiency thanks to the use of the preferred trajectory taking into consideration the Airspace users needs;
Increased punctuality and predictability of individual flights thanks to the collaborative framework of the trajectory management."

Today, air traffic flow and capacity management (ATFCM), airspace management (ASM) and air traffic control (ATC) are still separated processes and the interfaces between ATFCM, ASM and ATC processes and systems require further integration, as well as full collaboration between ATM actors and airspace users. Also, the sharing of airspace information is not optimally adapted to Aircraft Operators (AO) and other Airspace User (AU) processes, which is leading to limited usage of available dynamic configurable airspace. Similarly, the current ATM environment provides neither an accurate prediction of traffic and relevant measurements of its uncertainty nor the sector predicted workload with a confidence index, with which to determine efficient airspace organisation.
The organisation of resources across Area Control Centres need to be improved as well as the scoping of measures from local level to full network impact assessment, and the promotion of opportunity measures over those with implication on airspace users costs. The operational data shared in the network operations plan (NOP) has to be expanded in scope and time horizon to integrate more tactical (real-time) dynamic airspace configuration and Airports data. The relevant information should be accessible to everyone and distributed in a transparent but cohesive way with the aim of ensuring sufficient flexibility in the short term DCB phase and the efficient ATC involvement in the DCB process execution. Accurate traffic prediction has to be made available to all actors concerned (e.g. NM, AUs, ATC) from medium-term planning till execution of the trajectories for managing traffic complexity, solving traffic constraint issues and optimising the performance of the network. Relevant indicators to assess DCB measures and monitor execution against the predicted impact on network performance need to be defined and provided through automated tools enabling what-if and what-else analysis.

The project ‘Digital Network Management Services’ covers the following candidate SESAR Solutions:
Solution PJ.09-W2-44 Dynamic Airspace Configurations (DAC):
The objective of the solution is to improve the use of airspace capacity for both civil and military users by increasing the granularity and the flexibility in the airspace configuration and management within and across ANSPs’ areas of responsibilities. This solution will address the integration of concepts and procedures to allow flexible sectorisation boundaries to be dynamically modified based on demand. This includes potential implications for ATCO licences, international boundaries and potentially IOP and A/G multi-datalink communication capabilities.
Solution PJ.09-W2-45 Enhanced Network Traffic Prediction and shared complexity representation.
The solution aims at improving the accuracy of the network manager traffic prediction from medium-term planning phase (D-2) to execution (included), relying in particular on new trajectory management features such as the preliminary FPL. It shall adapt existing methodologies and algorithms for demand prediction and regional complexity assessment.
Solution PJ.09-W2-47 Network optimisation of multiple ATFCM time based measures.
The solution aims at improving the efficiency and reducing the adverse impact of multiple regulations affecting the same flight or flows. It explores the relationships between the DCB regulations and their interactions trough the flights to quantify the network effect of those interactions. Key to this solution is to identify and avoid regulations with negative impact on network performance.
Solution PJ.09-W2-48 Digital Integrated Network Management and ATC Planning (INAP).
The SESAR solution ‘digital INAP’ aims at filling the gap between the management of traffic flows at network level (dDCB) and the control of flights in individual sectors. The solution develops and integrates local functions and associated tools, roles and responsibilities providing an automated interface between local NM and ATC planning to assist controllers in alleviating traffic complexity, traffic density, and traffic flow problems.
Solution PJ.09-W2-49 Collaborative Network Performance Management.
The solution aims at providing a common framework and toolbox to the other solutions and actors, allowing them to assess the Network Performance in the pre-tactical and tactical phases of the Network Management. The solution shall develop transparent and shareable network performance indicators, network state monitoring and prediction to support NMOC supervision and awareness, network performance what-if and what-else capabilities.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Capacity through a dynamic configuration of airspace responding with flexibility to the Airspace users flight trajectory needs
Safety: Improved safety in better anticipating and managing potential overloads;
Efficiency thanks to the monitoring of the DCB measures against network performance and the implementation of corrective actions
Cost-efficiency: DCB allows improved ATM resource planning and better use of existing capacities leading to reduced ATC and Airport Capacity costs;
Predictability: the NOP will provide the planned network situation considering all known constraints and time deviation will be managed by anticipating demand/capacity imbalance detection and improving the implementation of DCB solutions;
Flexibility: common awareness to all stakeholders through the NOP and access to opportunities in case of late changes in capacity or demand."

With the extension of Arrival Management (AMAN) systems horizons, En-Route sectors are affected by concurrent arrival management strategies due to the overlapping AMAN horizons of several independent Terminal Manoeuvre Areas (TMAs). The interaction between traffic synchronisation and demand-capacity balancing (DCB) within the extended horizon needs to be addressed, and potential information integration needs and balancing mechanisms need to be investigated and developed to ensure delivering the optimal capacity. Complex interacting traffic flows in the TMA (including from/to multiple airports) need to be more actively managed to increase safety and improve fuel efficiency whilst capacity is increased. Continuous climb and continuous descent operations (CCO/CDO) at near idle thrust are environmentally friendly, because they are more fuel efficient and also minimize the time that aircraft have to be at low altitude, thereby reducing their noise impact. However, controllers often need to use intermediate level-offs in order to ensure separation. Use of stepped climbs and descents should be reduced at the same time as optimising flights laterally and with appropriate speed management, and optimising the overall Air Traffic Control (ATC) task. Multiple arrival management systems need to ensure a more regular flow of arriving aircraft managed for TMA optimisation as well as runway optimisation. Multiple departure management systems are required to enable a more consistent delivery of departures into the TMA and ultimately to En Route sectors. Improved flows will help to facilitate optimised profiles for aircraft, with dynamic route structures able to provide additional solutions integrated with the management of queues. IFR Rotorcraft operations are constrained to use same approach/departure procedures as fixed wing aircraft and due to their lower speed profiles, runway throughput is very often negatively impacted at busy airports. Specific rotorcraft procedures need to be defined in particular in adverse weather conditions to assist rotorcraft pilots by extending landing to degraded visual conditions.
Scope:
The project ‘Enhanced Arrival and Departures’ covers the following candidate SESAR Solutions:
Solution PJ.01-W2-08 Dynamic E-TMA for advanced continuous climb and descent operations and improved arrival and departure operations.
The objective of this solution is to improve descent and climb profiles in busy airspace, as well as the horizontal flight efficiency of arrivals and departures, while at the same time ensuring traffic synchronisation, short-term DCB and separation. This requires a very broad scope, which includes advances in airspace design, development of ground tools, and development of ATC and airborne procedures.
Solution PJ.01-W2-01 Next generation AMAN for 4D environment.
This solution will provide enhancements to the arrival management systems and procedures in the context of digitalisation in ATM: uplink of AMAN constraints, uplink of a STAR or custom arrival route to the aircraft via ATN B2 from the ATSU, potential use of maximum descent speeds, etc. It investigates strategies to increase the use of managed/automatic mode for flights handled by TTL/TTG during sequencing, improved consideration of downlinked aircraft data by AMAN algorithms, use of machine learning for the refinement of AMAN algorithms, etc.
Solution PJ.01-W2-06 Advanced rotorcraft operations in the TMA.
The solution addresses the development of a number of advanced procedures and technologies for rotorcraft (e.g. Head up Display (HUD), Helmet Mounted Display (HMD)) to assist rotorcraft pilots by extending landing to degraded visual conditions. The solution covers as well the development of new cost efficient traffic surveillance systems enhancing the pilots’ situation awareness as well as rotorcraft interoperability with GA, drones and RPAS.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Airspace capacity (improved throughput / airspace volume & time) and airport capacity (improved runway throughput flights/hour) thanks to the synchronisation of the arrival and departure sequences to and from airports using extended AMAN overlapping operations;
Environmental sustainability and fuel Efficiency thanks to the implementation of continuous descent and climb profiles;

Some small and remote European cities are highly dependent of local and regional airports for connection purposes, maintaining local business and cargo. Remote Tower Services (RTS) provide an opportunity for continued operation of airports and rural development. The costs for performing Air Traffic Service (ATS) are high and could be reduced, particularly at low to medium density airports, by provision of Air Traffic Services (ATS) from a remote tower specifically through a highly efficient multi remote tower solution. The focus on maintaining situation awareness becomes an increasingly important factor with multiple remote tower operations, therefore additional automation functionalities e.g. voice recognition, conflict detection, and conflict resolution advisories should be developed in order to gradually increase the operating range of the concept. There is a need for effective planning tools in both short term and long term all managed by a supervisor role.
The efficiency of using the CWP HMIs for the airport tower requires improvements by exploiting the latest mature technologies and new interaction modes e.g. touch, gesture, voice, etc..
Scope:
Solution PJ.05-W2-35 Multiple Remote Tower and Remote Tower centre.
The solution addresses the remotely provision of Air Traffic Services (ATS) from a Remote Tower Centre (RTC) to a large number of airports. It includes the development of RTC supervisor and support systems and advanced automation functions for a more cost efficient solution. The solution also covers the integration of approach for airports connected to the remote centre and connections between RTCs with systems for flow management and the development of tools and features for a flexible planning of all aerodromes connected to remote tower services.

The solution addresses the development of new human machine interface (HMI) interaction modes and technologies in order to minimise the load and mental strain on the Tower controllers. The SESAR solution shall consider modern design and development approaches and methodologies such as modularity, SoA, adaptive automation, etc. The new HMI interaction modes include the use of in-air gestures, attention control, user profile management systems, tracking labels, virtual and augmented reality, etc.

This project will develop solutions that are expected to provide:
Improved cost-efficiency with the optimisation of the use of available resources;
Increased safety with an increased awareness of the traffic situation thanks to the use of digital display information available to the tower controller;

Current operations within continental En-route and TMA airspace are based on sectorisation structures that intend to handle the traffic demand according to the capacity of the controllers to handle it. It results in the tactical use of multiple radar vectors and stepped climbs and descents to maintain separation between aircraft in high traffic situations. This leads to less efficient flight profiles and high levels of workload for both ATC and the flight crews. It makes it also very difficult to balance the operators’ requirements in terms of flight efficiency (notably user-preferred trajectories) with the need for overall capacity, safety of the operations and ATC workload. Occasionally, where no further splitting of sectors is possible due to limited controller resources, the sector demand exceeds the available controller capacity resulting in flow restrictions, level-capping and other measures that ensure safety at the expense of flight efficiency and timeliness. Future En-Route and TMA environment is anticipated to be even more loaded and complex than today’s.
New system functionalities and further steps of automation provide the chance to achieve significant operational benefits. New ATC tools and the development of new concepts will allow for sectorless environment (where appropriate) to suit various airspace structures like free route, various traffic levels and complexities. Controller productivity needs to be addressed with new team organisations to cope with the collaborative planning and control based on the unplanned boundaries concept.
In today’s situation Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) usually host a monolithic ATM system in each Air Traffic System Unit (ATSU) with very few information services and infrastructure elements being shared between the different centres. In the virtual centre approach, the controller working positions are decoupled and may even be geographically separated from the ATM information services that they consume, and these ATM information services may be shared between different ATSUs or even between ANSPs. The main benefits expected from the virtual centre approach are cost reduction and more flexibility to support load-balancing between the participating ATSUs, delegation of airspace or manage contingency situations. The development of technical services and common interfaces resulting from new technologies, working methods, service oriented architectures (SOA) and procedures would also need to address human factors considerations.
There is a need to increase the efficiency of using the CWP HMIs for the En-Route and APP ATC centre by exploiting the latest mature technologies and new interaction modes e.g. touch, gesture, voice, etc.
Scope:
The project ‘Separation Management and Controller Tools’ covers the following candidate SESAR Solutions:
Solution PJ.10-W2-73 Flight-centric ATC and Improved Distribution of Separation Responsibility in ATC.
The solution covers a concept that consists of assigning aircraft to ATCOs without references to geographical sectors, and have the aircraft controlled by that same ATCO across two or more geographical sectors. The solution requires flight-centric specific allocation, visualisation (traffic filtering), coordination tools (e.g. in the event of a conflict, establish which controller is responsible for its resolution) and, for high traffic densities advanced CD&R tools (that are not flight-centric specific). The solution also covers the concept of collaborative control with planned boundaries in which sectors are retained as they are today, with aircraft being assigned to a sector according to its geographic location. The boundaries between sectors have planned coordination conditions like in current operations, but with some additional flexibility by allowing controllers to issue clearances without prior coordination to aircraft in a different sector.
Solution PJ.10-W2-93 Delegation of airspace amongst ATSUs.
The objective of this solution is to explore the different possible delegation of airspace amongst ATSUs based on traffic / organisation needs (either static on fix-time transfer schedule (Day/Night) or dynamic e.g. when the traffic density is below/over certain level) or on contingency needs. The solution covers an operational thread, which aims at defining and validating the different types of delegation of airspace and a technical thread, which aims at specifying the impacts of the operational thread on the services defined in the Virtual centre concept.
Solution PJ.10-W2-96 HMI Interaction modes for ATC centre.
The solution addresses the development of new human machine interface (HMI) interaction modes and technologies in order to minimise the load and mental strain on controllers in the ATC centre. The SESAR solution shall consider modern design and development approaches and methodologies such as modularity, SoA, adaptive automation, etc. The new HMI interaction modes include the use of in-air gestures, attention control, user profile management systems, tracking labels, virtual and augmented reality, etc.
Solution PJ.10-W2-70 Collaborative control and Multi sector planner (MSP) in en-route.
The solution addresses the collaborative control with unplanned boundaries concept, in which the traditional requirement to coordinate traffic at all sector boundaries is waived for an area covering two or more sectors. In case it is not completed in wave 1, the solution scope covers as well the development, for the en-route environment, of the concept of operation and the required system support e.g. coordination tools for operating in a team structure where a Planner has responsibility for the airspace under the executive control of two or more independent Executive Controllers (multi-sector planner or MSP). The MSP is able to adjust the internal (executive) sector boundaries so that workload is balanced between the Executive controllers.
Expected Impact:
This project will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Safety by being flight centric focused in particular in Free route environment and a reduction of the potential conflict that are laterally far better distributed over the airspace;
Capacity thanks to the reduction of the partitioning of the airspace (sectors), the airspace capacity is not longer restricted by sector capacity and thanks to the reduction of the controller workload (reduction of sectors handovers) that would lead to increase the amount of flights per ATCO
Efficiency with a reduction of coordination and handover the pilot has to comply with and the set up
Flexibility thanks to the load-balancing or the management of the contingency situations between ACCs and controllers when applying virtual centre concept ;
Cost-efficiency thanks to the interoperability between system and the decoupling of the ATM data provision from the ATC service provision enabling data to be shared between different ATSUs."

The number of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) is continuously increasing and this will imply higher interactions with the wider ATM system. IFR RPAS operation characteristics e.g. speed, manoeuvrability, etc., together with their avionic system equipage may differ substantially from conventional aircraft.
One basic principle underpinning the integration of IFR RPAS in ATM, in alignment with ICAO principles, is that RPAS have to be treated in a similar manner to manned aircraft while duly considering the specific character of remotely-manned operations. IFR RPAS must be transparent (alike) to ATC and other airspace users.

Solution PJ.13-W2-111 ‘Collision avoidance for IFR RPAS’.
The solution will develop and operationally validate a detect and avoid (DAA) system for IFR RPAS, which consists of two functions: collision avoidance (CA) and remain well clear (RWC), in order to allow the remote pilot to contribute to safety by preventing collisions, should normal separation provision fail. The RWC function is designed to provide the remote pilot with greater situational awareness.
Solution PJ.13-W2-115 IFR RPAS accommodation in Airspace Class A to C.
The solution is aimed at accommodating IFR RPAS in non-segregated airspace in the short-term, in accordance with the drone roadmap in the ATM Masterplan. The objective is to enable IFR RPAS operating from dedicated airfields to routinely operate in airspace classes A-C as GAT without a chase plane escort. The development of ATC procedures, adaptations to the flight planning processes, contingency etc. are included in the solution.
Solution PJ.13-W2-117 IFR RPAS integration in Airspace Class A to C.
The SESAR solution aims at providing the technical capabilities and procedural means to allow IFR RPAS to comply with ATC instructions and the development of new procedures and tools to allow ATC to handle IFR RPAS in a cooperative environment in full integration with manned aviation.

The SESAR concept is based upon the fundamental element of trajectory sharing. The ultimate goal is a trajectory based ATM system where actors optimise business and mission trajectories through common trajectory information taking into account users priorities and ATC constraints. The objective is the sharing of the trajectories between the ATM actors including airspace users through an iterative process to take into account more accurate data once available (e.g. intentions, MET forecast, current traffic, airspace management). This will allow the Airspace User to choose the preferred way of integrating ATM constraints when required. There is a need to agree in more details on the elements that will constitute the reference business trajectory (RBT) in trajectory based operations (TBO) and better understand how these will be used operationally. The new ATM Solutions will need better trajectory predictions and additional data exchanges between systems.
A generic principle of the SES and the SESAR programme is that, where services can be delivered in a harmonised manner, they should be done so. The future high level architecture should offer an option for the de-fragmentation of the ATM system through the provision of harmonised or Common Services (a service to consumers that provides a capability in the same form that they would otherwise provide themselves). Introducing a Common Service will change how a solution is delivered and this is likely to change organisational relationships between the stakeholders due to the provision and consumption of the new service.
Scope:
The project ‘4D skyways’ covers the following candidate SESAR Solutions:
Solution PJ.18-W2-53 Improved Ground Trajectory Predictions enabling future automation tools.
The solution focuses on the operational validation of improved CD&R tools. The main goal is to increase the quality of separation management services reducing controller workload and separation buffers and facilitating new controller team organisations. The foundation is the improvement of the ground TP(EPP data beyond weight and CAS, known MET data or new MET data and capabilities, etc.).
Solution PJ.18-W2-56 Improved vertical profiles through enhanced vertical clearances.
The objective of this solution is to develop an automation support for ATCOs to issue vertical constraints that support more efficient flight profiles while ensuring separation provision. First step, for flight still in climb, enhanced prediction of vertical profile data are presented to ATCOs to facilitate decision making. In a second more advanced step, the ATC system would generate proposals for conflict-free clearances that take anticipated aircraft performance into account, which can be uplinked to the flight crew by ATCO..
Solution PJ.18-W2-57 RBT revision supported by datalink and increased automation.
The solution aims at supporting a continuous increase in the amount and the usefulness of information shared between air and ground and of the level of automation support to controllers and pilots, e.g. towards the automatic uplink of clearances with or without previous controller validation and towards increased use of the auto-load to FMS of uplinked clearances and of managed/automatic mode by the flight crew.
Solution PJ.18-W2-88 Trajectory Prediction Service.
This solution is a technical service conceived as being provided to Europeans ANSPs, AUs, AO, Military and the Network Manager (NM) in support of trajectory operations. The solution is intended to provide a single point of truth for a specific trajectory in the time frame from creation in long term pre-flight planning through to the flight execution phase. The solution is not intended to replace today’s flight data processing systems and consequently the service can be used as an input to ATC systems but not used directly for control purposes.
Expected Impact:
The project will contribute to increase:
Safety by generating and proposing conflict free clearance that considers aircradt performance
Interoperability by sharing the same trajectory view between air and all ground actors;
Predictability by improved trajectory accuracy and sharing information updates throughout the flight;
Flexibility by matching the trajectory with the Airspace User needs;

Airport will have to improve the efficiency of runway operations and their resilience in visually and/or meteorological challenging conditions. This would be achieved in fully integrating surface management tools with other systems including runway occupancy time prediction, wake separation and arrival and departure management (AMAN/DMAN) systems. In turn it will further reduce the number of incidents / accidents at the airport e.g. collisions on the apron and taxiway with traffic and/or fixed obstacles.
Airports and airlines need to enhance their capability to deliver, plan and improve the use of airport resources so that costs, emissions and fuel consumption can be reduced, whilst improving passenger satisfaction.
Scope:
Solution PJ.02-W2-14 Evolution of separation minima for increased runway throughput.
The solution addresses the refinement and consolidation of static pairwise separation matrixes and weather dependent separation minima for successive arrivals, the development of static pairwise separation matrixes for successive departures and between arrivals and departures. It includes the development and validation of ATCO tools and also covers the potential use of flight-specific aircraft characteristics taken from the eFPL, or from an evolution of the eFPL (e.g. aircraft weight), downlinked from the aircraft.
Solution PJ.02-W2-21 Digital evolution of integrated surface management.
The solution covers the development (e.g. using new algorithms, artificial intelligence/expert systems) of procedures and required system support for an improved surface traffic management, including extension of the A-SMGCS routing functions and the integration of inputs from airport DCB processes. The solution covers as well the guidance assistance to both pilots and vehicle drivers using Airfield Ground Lighting (AGL), the consolidation of the ‘Follow-The-Greens’ procedures, the exchange of information between ATC and vehicles/aircrafts using airport data link and other guidance means, and the development of enhanced airport safety nets for controllers beyond those delivered in SESAR 1.
Solution PJ.02-W2-04 Advanced geometric GNSS based procedures in the TMA.
This solution addresses the use of GNSS geometric guidance from the initial approach fix or earlier, in order to make the transition easier in certain MET conditions (e.g. high temperatures). The research will address the potential impact of MET conditions on the safe conduct of advanced curved operations and the required separation minima. The research may also address curved departures, potentially combined with precise geometric altimetry, in order to further develop curved departure routes that turn shortly after take-off.
Solution PJ.02-W2-17 Improved access to secondary airports.
The solution aims at increasing access to secondary airports in all conditions, including in particular low visibility conditions by developing systems and operational procedures that allow operational credits as considered by the Performance Based Aerodrome Operational Minima (PBAOM). The validation will focus on business aviation, general aviation, rotorcraft and military aircraft.
Solution PJ.02-W2-25 Safety support tools for avoiding runway excursions.
The solution aims at improving runway condition awareness to increase safety in order to prevent runway excursions (take-off and landing), including the enhancement of runway status information on secondary airports, the on board runway friction coefficient elaboration and the airport runway status model update. The objective is to provide the flight crews with objective and synthetic information elements for them to make the right decisions during take-off, approach, and landing phases.
Expected Impact:
The delivered solutions are expected to have a positive impact on:
Airport and Airspace TMA Capacity - Increase runway and airspace throughput (e.g. reducing runway occupancy time, or arrivals and departures wake turbulence separation) and resilience;
Safety: maintain or increase runway, taxiway and apron safety levels, increase situational awareness, ATC Workload maintained or reduced;
Improved access to secondary airports, with expected benefits in resilience, cost-efficiency and increased flexibility under non-nominal conditions at the airport;
Predictability - increased predictability and airport efficiency (e.g. runway occupancy time, runway exit and departure rotation);
Environmental Sustainability - reduced fuel consumption and noise near the airports"

The full integration between Airport and Network Operations has still to be achieved. In particular, the management of predicted airport performance deterioration needs to be aligned with the Network. Collaborative recovery procedures and support tools in coordination with all the relevant ATM stakeholders are required to facilitate the pro-active management of predicted performance deteriorations such as airport capacity reduction. Total airport demand and capacity balancing processes and tools require further integration with the execution tools (arrivals and departure management systems and advanced surface movement guidance & control systems) and resource allocation planning tools (e.g. stand/gate allocation) with the objective of optimising the airport capacity to better comply with the traffic demand. Airport landside/airside performance monitoring and management processes need to be further integrated while the turnaround monitoring within the Airport Operations Centre (APOC) requires refinement in coordination with the Airspace Users. Impact assessment tools available to the APOC need to better integrate information about MET forecast uncertainty. Post-operations analysis processes, support tools and reporting capabilities need to be as well developed.
Scope:
Solution PJ.04-W2-28 Enhanced Collaborative Airport Performance Planning and Monitoring.
The solution aims at enhancing the collaborative airport performance planning and monitoring processes, in particular, through the inclusion in the airside processes of the relevant landside (passenger and baggage flow) process outputs, the consideration of connectivity and multi-modality aspects and the extension of turn-round monitoring within the APOC.

Scope:
The project ‘SWIM infrastructure’ covers the following candidate SESAR Solutions:
Solution PJ.17-W2-100 SWIM TI Purple Profile for Air/Ground Safety-Critical Information Sharing.
The solution allows the distribution of safety-critical information through A/G SWIM infrastructure and aeronautical telecommunications network/Internet protocol suite (ATN/IPS) networking, rather than legacy point-to-point contracted services.

GBAS based procedures can help mitigating the negative effects of weather and especially low visibility conditions as key contributors to airport and network delays.
GBAS helps as well overcoming the limitations inherent to ILS operations, in particular the need to protect the ILS critical and sensitive areas, which results in restricted ground movements and extra spacing margins between aircraft in order to accommodate the longer runway occupancy times (ROT). Since GBAS has limited (GBAS Local Object Consideration Areas) or no protection areas, usually located outside aircraft movement areas, this allows for reducing the ROT in low visibility conditions, resulting in reduced spacing between arrival aircraft, although the amount of runway throughput that can be gained depends on wake turbulence separation and any other additional spacing needs due to the airport layout. GBAS supports CNS infrastructure rationalisation since, whilst ILS operations require one ground station per runway, one GBAS ground station only can be used for multiple runways operations.
Scope:
The VLD aims at demonstrating a number of GBAS/SBAS-enabled advanced approach procedures developed and validated in wave 1 using: dual thresholds (DT), second runway aiming point (SRAP), increased glide slope (IGS), adaptive increased glide slope (A-IGS) and increased glide slope to a second runway aiming point (IGS-to-SRAP). The scope may include the demonstration of similar concepts (when possible) based on RNAV (Baro LNAV/VNAV) rather than GBAS/SBAS. The VLD shall consider different airport layouts, setting-up various airport platforms at the level of pre-operational or operational status to support the Proof of Concept. This topic may include activities aiming at completing TRL-6 maturity for the following aspects: the extended scope (beyond the outcome of SESAR 1) of GBAS GAST-D under candidate solution 79 ‘Dual Frequency / Multi Constellation DFMC GNSS/SBAS and GBAS’ and the mid-term alternative Position, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) under candidate solution 81.

Airport and Airspace TMA Capacity - Increase runway and airspace throughput and resilience;
Predictability - Increasing predictability and airport efficiency (e.g. of the landing rate, of Runway Occupancy Time, runway exit and departure rotation);
Environmental Sustainability - Reducing fuel consumption and noise near the airports."

At capacity constrained airports traffic demand for runway operations exceeds the runway capacity. With the growth in air traffic there is an increasing number of airports that are becoming capacity constrained for significant periods of each day.
Scope:
The VLD aims at demonstrating the following candidate SESAR Solutions that improve runway throughput while keeping safety levels:
Arrival concept Static-Pairwise (S-PWS or PWS-A) provides a more precise definition of the minimum safe wake separation required for a pair of ICAO aircraft types through an optimisation of the ICAO wake turbulence separation classes;
Wake Turbulence Separations (for Departures) based on Static Aircraft Characteristics aims at optimizing the ICAO wake turbulence separation classes by use of longitudinal wake turbulence static pair-wise separation (S-PWS) minima on departures for the initial common departure path from the runway, applicable in all operating conditions;
Weather-dependent reductions of separation may also be demonstrated;
Optimised Runway Delivery (ORD) for arrival and departures that have been also developed in the solution shall be used. These tools make use of Target Distance Indicators (TDIs) to enable consistent and efficient delivery of the required separation or spacing between arrival pairs on final approach up to the runway landing threshold;
Wake decay enhancing concepts a technical design of the so-called plate lines shall be elaborated that is compatible with airport structural requirements (e.g. stability, frangibility) and approval of authorities for the installation of the plate line shall be obtained;
Reduction of radar separation to 2NM for in-trail pairs on final approach Solution #02-03 (researched in Wave 1) refers to the concept of Minimum Pair Separation Based on Required Surveillance Performance (RSP) in support of a reduction of the in-trail Minimum Radar Separation from 2.5 NM to 2 NM on final approach at Large and Medium Airports and TMA High Complexity and TMA Medium Complexity sub-operational environments so as to provide a direct positive impact on runway throughput during periods of capacity constrained operations;
Integrated AMAN-DMAN SESAR considers a number of concepts that aim at optimizing runway operations by providing dynamic assistance to controllers and supervisors in TWR and TMA. Their objectives are to increase runway throughput through the optimisation of arrival/departure spacing. The improvements include the use of a Runway Manager (RMAN) to optimise the planning of the runway use, and the sequence-based coupling of AMAN and DMAN including a sequence update a few minutes before touchdown and the use of TDIs between arrivals to support ATCOs to create the right gap between arrivals. This VLD will demonstrate the application of these concepts in order to optimise the use of the runway capacity for single or multiple runway airports;
The VLD may include activities to complete the TRL-6 maturity for candidate solutions 83 ‘Surveillance Performance Monitoring’ and 84 ‘New use and evolution of Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Surveillance’.

The importance of moving aircraft on the airport surface from stand to runway and vice versa in a safe, controlled and organised manner is paramount for airports and even more when capacity restrictions resulting from weather or other circumstances affect operations.
Scope:
The VLD aims at demonstrating candidate SESAR Solutions that improve airport surface management and safety at the airport. In particular it may cover the following candidate SESAR Solutions:
‘Traffic alerts for pilots for airport operations’ aims at warning pilots in case a traffic conflict is detected on airport surface. The solution is applicable to both mainline and business aircraft and the demonstration shall cover exercises for both. Note that the performance and quality reception of broadcast aircraft data (ADS-B) is a key enabler for the solution;
‘Guidance assistance through airfield ground lighting’ is a ground-based service, intended for controllers, flight crews and vehicle drivers, and supported by the Advanced Surface Management Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) Guidance function;
‘CAVS’ consists of a concept for delegation of separation from ATC to the flight crew on final approach (CDTI-assisted visual separation (CAVS)). The concept is based on the flight crew using the CAVS application on the CDTI, which requires ADS-B-in information;
‘On-board Braking Action Computation System’ (OBACS) considers the aircraft as a measuring device, a ‘sensor in itself’ and collects in real-time all relevant raw on-board data (engine settings, aircraft weight, aerodynamic braking, speed, deceleration, directional control etc.) to compute an on-board braking action. This on-board computed braking action is transmitted to the ground system to be considered and integrated in the RWYCC assessment algorithm.

Communication, Navigation and Surveillance, except for few cases, are actually significantly relying on national infrastructure deployed and operated by Air Navigation Services Providers. This leads to a deployment of technologies based on local/national choices and priorities resulting in un-synchronised, un-homogeneous and fragmented deployments. Some of these technologies have been in operation since decades and are not capable to support the automation of the ATM and the future need of airspace users including new entrants (e.g. RPAS). New technologies are being introduced. However, optimisation of the infrastructure has not largely been undertaken resulting in accumulation of legacy and new technologies having negative impacts of cost of operation and maintenance, spectrum usage, number of embarked systems.
Performance requirements for Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) systems are becoming increasingly complex and demanding considering convergence towards a common infrastructure, and a unified concept of operations (CONOPS) across the different (COM, NAV and SUR) domains. The new technical capabilities must be developed to fully meet the requirements derived from operational needs, taking into account the new emerging CNS technologies.

Solution PJ.14-W2-77 FCI Services.
The Solution will allow the real-time sharing of trajectories, timely access to ATM data and information services and the support to SWIM. The ‘Communication Services’ will support ATN-B1, ATN-B2 ATS services, and be expandable to support advanced ATM applications such as ATN-B3 ATS services. It will support AOC services and digital voice (VoIP) services. The Communication Services will be delivered using ATN/IPS and will allow interoperability with ATN/OSI protocols.
Solution PJ.14-W2-107 Future Satellite Communications Data link.
The solution addresses the development of the future satellite data link technologies Iris Long term Class A SatCom for both the continental and remote/oceanic regions needed for supporting the future concepts beyond 2020.
Solution PJ.14-W2-60 FCI Terrestrial Data Link and A-PNT enabler (L-DACS).
The solution constitutes the future terrestrial A/G and A/A data link solution, which is one of the ‘ICAO technologies’, and supports the increasing ATM performance requirements (due to the growth of air traffic and its complexity). L-DACS constitutes a potential component of the A-PNT to support positioning and navigation requirements in PBN/RNP operations in case of a GNSS degradation or outage.
Solution PJ.14-W2-81 Long-term alternative Position, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT).
The solution aims at developing A-PNT systems capable to provide better performances in comparison to the short-term solution (based on DME-DME) and support PBN/RNP operations in case of a GNSS degradation or outage. Long term A-PNT airborne solution is expected to support: RNP 1 for the Standard Instrument Departure Route (SID) or Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) developed upon RNP 1 navigation specification, the airways defined with RNP 0.3 or RNP 1 constraints, and preferably RNP-APCH operations down to LNAV/VNAV minima supposing appropriate ground infrastructure. The solution also address the standalone mid-term aircraft technological enhancement (researched in Wave 1) that supports RNP‐based Operations in the TMA e.g. RNP1 SIDs and STARs (mid-term A-PNT).
Solution PJ.14-W2-79 Dual Frequency / Multi Constellation DFMC GNSS/SBAS and GBAS.
The solution addresses the progress in development of GBAS approach service type F (GAST-F) and its degraded modes, which is the final goal to achieve the target ambition of SESAR. The solution also addresses DFMC GNSS/SBAS/GBAS receivers architectural consideration and the completion of wave 1 activities related to ABAS / SBAS DFMC GNSS developments for multi-constellation GNSS receivers and GBAS approach service type D (GAST-D) (e.g. extended scope including: Expanded Service Volume (ESV), extreme latitudes, complex airports).
Solution PJ.14-W2-61 Hyper Connected ATM.
The solution aims at identifying and specifying the high level operational requirements for a fast and exponentially capable broadband air/ground and air/air datalink for supporting future ATM and U-space operations, air/ground data exchanges, etc.
Solution PJ.14-W2-110 Aircraft as an AIM/MET sensor and consumer.
The SESAR solution addresses the application of information made available by the aircraft such as Aircraft Meteorological DAta Relay (AMDAR) or any other avionics source (information derived from ADS-C application can be used), and future evolutions, or CNS status information, in Air Traffic Management, and the representation and the improved usage of MET and AIM information to airspace users in order to enhance their situational awareness and to improve strategic trajectory management and collaborative decision making.
Solution PJ.14-W2-83 Surveillance Performance Monitoring.
The solution aims at enabling an improved performance monitoring of surveillance systems e.g. ‘quasi real-time’ functionality and ensuring the correct functioning of the ATM surveillance function. This applies both at the individual sensor level and at ATC end-to-end level (input to the controller working position) e.g. spotting degradation trends early in the process. The solution shall consider both current and emergent surveillance techniques: WAM, ground-based and space-based ADS-B, independent non-cooperative surveillance sensors (INCS, including MSPSR), MLAT, SMR, etc.
Solution PJ.14-W2-84 New use and evolution of Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Surveillance.
The solution covers major improvements of cooperative and non-cooperative surveillance systems in areas such as composite surveillance, multi-sensor data fusion, new non-cooperative surveillance systems, secured surveillance systems and future ADS-B communications link.

The demand for drone services is steadily increasing, with the potential to generate significant economic growth and societal benefits, as recognised in the 2015 EU Aviation Strategy, and in the 2016 SESAR Drones Outlook Study and Warsaw Declaration on drones. In order to realise this potential, the Declaration calls for “urgent action on the airspace dimension, in particular the development of the concept of U-space”. Ultimately, U-space will enable complex drone operations with a high degree of automation to take place in all types of operational environments, including urban areas. U-space must be flexible enough to encourage innovation, support the development of new businesses and facilitate the overall growth of the European drone services market while properly addressing, at EU level, safety and security issues, respecting the privacy of citizens, and minimising the environmental impact.
Scope:
The introduction of new aerial vehicles within the airspace requires to further ensure a full collaborative approach between all actors with the objective to ensure efficient interface between U-space and ATM, and to avoid airspace fragmentation.
U-space – ATM SWIM Interface validates the exchange of UTM information through harmonised SWIM information services between various UTM stakeholders such as drone operators, UTM service providers, ATM service providers, data service providers, aeronautical data providers and authorities.
Collaborative ATM U-space Environment Concept Development develops the U-space-ATM collaborative concept and covers operations inside and outside controlled airspace, further defining the interface between ATM and U-space, as well as examining the corresponding information-exchange concept and requirements.
Demand for use of very high-level airspace has increased in the last years and this trend is expected to gain momentum in the coming years. ICAO has provisionally adopted the term ‘higher airspace’ to refer to that volume of airspace between airspace where ATM provides services (typical upper level of FL600) and the boundary between airspace and space (approximately 100 km). AU operating in this airspace are sometimes referred to as ‘New Entrants’, and have many different operating characteristics, such as unmanned HALE vehicles providing internet coverage or surveillance over large areas and Unmanned Free Balloons (UFB), as well as manned sub-orbital flights for leisure or scientific purposes (e.g. experiments, films or tourism at zero gravity) and supersonic or hyper-sonic passenger aircraft.
Expected Impact:
The delivered solutions are expected to have a positive impact on access and equity enabling U-space operations and high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators."

In the area of voice communications, the current controller-pilot voice communications concept of operations is a de facto result of the way of working and the performance of the legacy system (i.e. the analogue DSB-AM VHF radio system). In the area of controller-pilot communications via datalink, the current CPDLC is applicable only above FL285. The SESAR concept considers an evolution towards digital voice channels and to an increase use of CPDLC, including its extension below FL285.
The increased connectivity between air and ground required to support the future concept will be realised in a multilink environment, according to the Master Plan principles of service-orientation and scalability, of which the future air-ground terrestrial datalink (LDACS) is a key element, which will support also the resilience of aircraft navigation.

The objective is to increase A/G connectivity, and avoid that traffic growth is blocked due to the lack of availability of VHF frequencies. Once digital voice is implemented, it is foreseen that part of the spectrum currently allocated to ATC will could be available for other aeronautical applications. The solution should bring as well a potential increase of the level of security compared to current operations, e.g. by using technical means to identify where a transmission comes from for verification purposes. L-DACS (L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System) is a multi-application cellular broadband system capable of simultaneously providing various kinds of Air Traffic Services (including ATN B3) and Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) communications services in all environments. L-DACS is optimized for data link communications, and is also able to support aircraft navigation
Expected Impact:
The SESAR solution will contribute to:
Provide a data-link capability able to deal with the increased communications needs in support of the expected traffic growth.
Support future operational concepts requiring more stringent technical A/G datalink communication performance (reduced latency compared to current datalink).
Improve the resilience of GNSS, and potential contribution to the rationalization of the CNS infrastructure (spectrum efficiency).
Contribute to the virtualisation of ATC services through the geographically independent communications concept enabled by the digital voice service."

The trajectory development and management processes in ATM currently do not allow each individual user to incorporate specific aircraft/flight priorities into the requested trajectory, and respect any constraint in a way that best meets the business priorities. Today the ATM system allows little flexibility to airspace users (e.g. ATFM slot swapping process). Airspace users’ full participation through their flight operations centres (FOC/WOC) into ATM collaborative processes, including flights’ prioritisation with the full user driven prioritisation process (UDPP), is essential to minimise impacts of deteriorated operations for all stakeholders including airspace users.
Complex interacting traffic flows in the TMA (including from/to multiple airports) need to be more actively managed to increase safety and improve fuel efficiency whilst capacity is increased. Use of stepped climbs and descents should be reduced at the same time as optimising flights laterally and with appropriate speed management, and optimising the overall Air Traffic Control (ATC) task. Multiple arrival management systems need to ensure a more regular flow of arriving aircraft managed for TMA optimisation as well as runway optimisation. Multiple departure management systems are required to enable a more consistent delivery of departures into the TMA and ultimately to En-Route sectors.
Scope:
Collaborative framework managing delay constraints on arrivals main objective is to define and validate a collaborative framework for the coordination and collaboration between different ATM processes (including the so-called User Driven Prioritisation Process - UDPP), dealing with delay constraints on arrivals (considered the most important contributor to performance issues). This collaborative framework shall enable the coordination and integration of 4D trajectory constraints for various stakeholders (Airports, ANSPs, AUs and Network Manager) in order to ensure the continued stability and capacity performance of the ATM network, at regional and local level, while taking into account the AU business needs.
Dynamic E-TMA for Advanced Continuous Climb and Descent Operations and improved Arrival and Departure Operations aims at improving descent and climb profiles in busy airspace (as close as possible to near idle CDOs and optimised CCOs), as well as the horizontal flight efficiency of arrivals and departures, while at the same time ensuring traffic synchronization (for optimum use of runway capacity), short-term DCB (to ensure best use of ATC capacity) and separation. This challenging objective requires a very broad scope, which includes advances in airspace design, development of ground and airborne tools, and development of ATC and airborne procedures.
Expected Impact:
This topic will develop solutions that are expected to have a positive impact on the Network improving:
Capacity based on a better integration of the AUs trajectory definition and the network demand and capacity function. Airspace capacity and airport capacity thanks to the synchronisation of the arrival and departure sequences to and from airports using extended AMAN overlapping operations;
Increased flexibility by allowing the airspace users to recommend to the network management function a priority order for flights and Increased punctuality and predictability of individual flights thanks to the collaborative framework of the trajectory management
Environmental sustainability - fuel efficiency thanks to the use of the preferred trajectory taking into consideration the Airspace users’ needs and the implementation of continuous descent and climb profiles;"

The current operation requires that controllers hold both a licence for a particular rating (e.g. Approach Control Surveillance (APS), Area Control Surveillance (ACS)) and then a validation that permits that person to exercise their licence in defined volumes of airspace. The need for sector-specific training is not the only limiting factor: once a controller has been trained for a defined volume .of airspace, he or she needs to stay current. The AAS points to the need to control for a specific number of hours in a sector to maintain currency as being a key limiting factor
Scope:
Increased flexibility in ATCO validation aims at developing and validating an initial concept that aims at increasing the flexibility in the ATCO validation. The solution will allow ATCOs to be allowed to work in a larger geographical area, number of sectors or sector configurations than they do today, increasing the flexibility of the controller-licensing scheme and optimising ATCO qualifications for a higher number of airspace configurations. This will be achieved by reducing the number of effective hours required to maintain his/her validation for working at full capacity. The solution also covers other use cases such as the consolidation of sector-groups or ATC facilities at night or other periods of low demand.
Generic Controller Validations represents a fundamental change of paradigm. The generic controller validations concept proposes to completely move away from the concept of controller unit endorsements. In order to achieve this goal, the geo-specific aspects of air traffic control would need to be removed as much as possible, and for those that remain adequate mitigations would need to be put in place to allow ATCOs to maintain a safe, orderly and efficient flow of air traffic in spite of having no local knowledge. The concept would allow an ATCO to work any airspace, anywhere, in Europe (or the world), whether managed with traditional sectors or without sectors, according to the flight-centric ATC concept, provided the controller held the appropriate operational validation for the position. This solution will make it no longer required that ATCOs work a minimum number of hours on a specific sector or flight-centric area for him or her to be able to provide air traffic control; instead, it is expected that there would be a generic currency requirement, so that controllers would need to exercise their operational validation for a minimum number of hours per period in order to stay current as controllers with the set of tools associated to their rating, rather than current in a specific geographical area.
Expected Impact:
The increased flexibility in rostering delivered by the solution is expected to finally result in increased capacity with the same ATCO resources."

This VLD will demonstrate the first steps towards improved predictability at both Network and local level through the improved use of target times and trajectory information. The sharing and use of on-board 4D trajectory data by the ground ATC system will result in improved predictability. This improved predictability of aircraft trajectory will benefit both airspace users and ANSPs and is expected to have positive impact on fuel saving and reduction of delay variability.
This VLD will help prepare the environment (anticipating the full scale deployment under the responsibility of the SESAR Deployment Manager) for initial 4D (i4D) and the later use of Controlled Time of Arrival (CTA) and Controlled Time Over (CTO) although these two last elements remain outside the scope for this VLD as they are not sufficiently mature at this stage.
This VLD is an integral part of the SESAR Solutions delivery approach towards the SESAR deployment phase. The objective of this demonstration is to bridge “industrial research” and “deployment” related to the PCP ATM Functionality 6 (as defined in Commission Implementing Regulation EU No 716/2014), and not to replace either type of activity.
Scope:
Initial Trajectory Information Sharing – Initial 4D (i4D) consists of the improved use of target times and trajectory information, including where available the use of on-board 4D trajectory data by the ground ATC systems and Network Manager systems, implying fewer tactical interventions and improved de-conflicting. The predicted trajectory can be synchronised between the ground system and the aircraft by the downlink of trajectory data between equipped aircraft and service providers that are able to incorporate this information into their Flight Data Processing System (FDPS). Furthermore improved interoperability between the ground systems of adjacent Air Traffic Service Units (ATSU) shall enable better exchange of the trajectory data supporting better coordination between centres, extending the horizon where ground trajectory prediction tools can meet the accuracy requirements that are necessary for them to be used for advanced Air Traffic Management (ATM) service provision.
Once awarded this VLD should:
establish a limited set of sustainable SESAR high-technology demonstration platforms in relation to the “Enabling Aviation Infrastructure” key feature of the SESAR 2020 programme;
illustrate the combination and synchronization of key PCP Air and Ground functionalities in order to demonstrate a global improvement of ATM system performance (e.g. Separation Service delivery, Traffic Synchronisation);
This VLD shall aim at minimum at a SESAR system demonstration in a close-to-operational environment including the preparation and platform availability to support demonstrations in targeted operational environments involving end-users. The involvement of these end-users to perform the related operational demonstration will be contracted through open calls that will be awarded in a second step and will run in parallel.
Expected Impact:
This VLD will assess the benefit of using real flights Aircraft Information to improve the ATC operations in at least one ground industrial platform in a close to operational environment; it will serve as Proof of Concept for AF#6 as defined in the PCP.
This VLD shall illustrate the combination and synchronization of key PCP Air and Ground functionalities in order to demonstrate how improved consistency between air and ground trajectories through the air-to-ground down-linking of trajectory data enhances the overall performance of ATM (e.g. Separation Service delivery, Traffic Synchronisation). These ATC operations are at the heart of ground-based systems developed by SESAR. The use of downlinked airborne data allows for more precise anticipation of the air traffic situation, which reduces the need for tactical intervention.
Maximum benefits are expected be realised for trajectory prediction for the climb and descent phases of flight, because airborne 4D trajectory information will allow the ATM system to plan against each individual aircraft’s updated speed schedule plan, which often needs to be changed during the execution phase due to changes in the operational environment (e.g. Top-Of-Descent (TOD) variability, MET factors, updated 2D route). Execution-phase airborne speed schedule updates are currently not exchanged with the ground ATM infrastructure. ANSPs are consequently forced to work with trajectory prediction based on pre-departure speed schedules only. In particular, use of airborne 4D trajectory data in ground trajectory prediction feeding an Extended Arrival Manager (E-AMAN) will result in more stable arrival planning, which will benefit not only the ANSP, but also the airport hence overall network performance."

The main objective of this VLD during Wave 1 is to ensure that FO-IOP works in the real world upper En-Route airspace environment of several ACCs, thus demonstrating it is sufficiently reliable, meets performance expectations and supports the ACCs daily operational functions and procedures. This includes demonstrating the correct implementation of blue and yellow SWIM profiles. Furthermore it will be demonstrated that FO-IOP can be used without compatibility problems with other ATM functions, such as OLDI. This is a key deployment aspect, because FO-IOP and OLDI are expected to co-exist in operational service for a very long transition period.
The functional and geographical scope of this VLD are to demonstrate that FO-IOP works in upper airspace ACCs, supporting standard coordination and transfer functions during execution flight phase, based on SESAR1 P10.02.05 Technical Specification D55. This demonstration will address only G/G Interoperability between ATC.
This VLD shall use “Shadow Mode” and “Live Trials” techniques:
Shadow Mode shall demonstrate that FO-IOP equipped ACCs can process all live traffic information such as radar-data, flight plan data, aeronautical data, MET data etc., with sufficient performance and stability, but without direct impact on air traffic. Typically the shadow mode could be executed on an operational ATM system in test mission mode. The added value of the shadow mode is to allow performing real time validation operating in the real operational traffic scenarios.
Live Trial shall be executed in a real operational environment with a direct impact on air traffic. Hence it is necessary to include all safety and security related activities, to assure there will be no adverse impact on, or risk introduced to air traffic.
The following activities shall be performed:
Shadow Mode in upper airspace.
Preparation of Live Trials in upper airspace.
Completion of Live Trials in upper airspace.

Water, soil quality and nutrients are key determinants of plant growth and crop productivity. With supplies of these inputs becoming increasingly variable and scarce, improvements in water use efficiency (WUE) and nutrient use efficiency (NUE) are of particular importance for both plant breeding and crop management, as are issues of yield stability.
Scope:
Proposals will lay the ground for a better understanding and management of highly dynamic processes of combined abiotic variations and their effects on crops. More specifically, activities will establish how combined water and nutrient stresses act upon plants taking into account complex interactions between plants/roots, soils and below ground biodiversity. Knowledge of these basic processes should be linked to overall system resource- use efficiency in crops on the basis of a thorough understanding of the interplay between crop genetics, crop management and the environment. Findings will be applied to the development and testing of strategies and tools for soil, water and crop management. Also, they will serve to identify (combinations of) above- and below-ground traits associated with improved plant performance under restricted water and nutrient availability to develop crop breeding strategies and tools.
Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1] to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors including farming are brought together. The topic is open to all types of crop production and farming systems (e.g. arable farming, horticulture, grassland, fruit trees, agro-forestry) and should benefit both conventional and organic agriculture in various pedo-climatic conditions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will enhance our capacity to deal with multiple abiotic stresses in cropping systems. More specifically project outputs will serve to
reveal how different combinations of water and nutrient stresses interact and impact on crops, in particular on agriculturally important traits;
increase the range of farm-level crop management strategies and tools to respond better to variable levels of water and nutrient supply;
support breeding strategies and tools to develop crops that can adapt better to water and nutrient stresses and ensure high product quality;
identify combinations of genotypes and management practices suited to increase water and nutrient use efficiency of crops (this could include exploiting the natural variation e.g. in traditional crops).
More generally and in the long term, outputs and results will help to increase the resilience of crop production in more variable environments and ultimately secure productivity. They will also contribute to optimising water use and reducing nutrient losses in agricultural systems, thereby also reducing the environmental impact of agricultural activities, in particular with regard to water quality.

This VLD will assess the benefit of Flexible Airspace Management and Free Route to improve ATM Network performance; it will serve as Proof of Concept for AF#3 as defined in the PCP.
The Proof of Concept to be conducted under this VLD is a confidence building exercise that comes in addition to the traditional validation required prior to certification and implementation of new concepts or new technologies. This has to be distinguished from operational live trials since it brings a new dimension of the validation: early operations with a significant scale environment.
The Proof of Concept consists in an early operation of the SESAR Solutions making use of pre-operational or operational products (airborne and ground) in a real operational environment."

","Research and Innovation action
","27 October 2015
","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
Diversity is recognised as a key factor element for adaptation of crops to more variable environments (including climate and management). In this context increasing attention is being paid to associations/mixtures of species and to their potential for stabilising yields and reducing losses caused by weeds, plant diseases and abiotic stresses. For example, crop mixtures have shown good potential for managing disease and insect outbreaks or controlling weeds. Associations of annual and perennial crops have shown particular resilience against abiotic stresses such as drought. There is a need for a better understanding of synergistic plant/crop interactions and how these can be used more systematically in breeding and management.
Scope:
Activities will help to unravel the mechanisms underlying beneficial plant interactions in cropping systems and lead to a better understanding of the dynamics between plants and their biotic and abiotic environments. Proposals will turn this knowledge into practical applications for breeding and crop management taking into account the corresponding changes in agronomic and breeding practices. Activities should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1] and ensure that appropriate account is taken of scientific, farming, agronomic and breeding expertise throughout the work with due attention to participatory and demonstration activities: All types of crop production and farming systems (e.g. arable farming, horticulture, grassland, fruit trees, agro-forestry), and diverse pedo-climatic conditions in Europe can be covered. Work proposed shall benefit both conventional and organic agriculture. International cooperation is encouraged wherever it adds value to achieving the objectives of the proposed work.
Selected projects will liaise closely with complementary activities funded under topic RUR-6 on crop diversification systems in the Rural Renaissance call.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities will support the adoption of productive and resilient agricultural systems which capitalise on the benefits of high plant species diversity. This overall goal will be achieved by
scientifically supported and field tested evidence on the mechanisms underpinning beneficial crop associations and their effects on crop performance and product quality;
increasing farmers' and breeders' knowledge of potential benefits of 'plant teams' (e.g. with regard to resource facilitation, pest and disease restriction/control);
promoting diversity-rich crop management practices;
increasing the availability of plant varieties suited for inclusion in crop associations and mixtures including traditional varieties.
In the longer term, results will support yield stability and diversification in the primary sector, increase resilience against environmental fluctuations and support healthier diets. They may also enhance ecosystem services associated with increased agro-biodiversity.

","11 December 2013
","26 June 2014","Scope:
Specific challenge:European crop production is facing more and more difficulties in remaining competitive in the global market for many reasons. Some of these reasons are the loss of soil fertility and the consequent massive use of expensive external nutrient inputs, notably Nitrogen and Phosphorous, for which European agriculture is almost totally dependent on imported products, or on fertilizers produced with expensive industrial processes, which generates greenhouse gases (GHGs). Therefore, more sustainable crop management strategies are needed to maintain or increase soil fertility. Inappropriate soil and water management and the overuse of external inputs in intensive crop production systems, represent an economic loss for the farmer and a significant burden for the environment and subsequent impact on human health, as they contribute significantly to ground water and surface water pollution, GHGs emissions, the build-up in soil contaminants, such as heavy metals and organic pollutants. Better soil management and optimisation of fertilisers and water are of paramount importance for conciliating the necessary competitiveness and the long-term sustainability of the entire intensive crop production sector in Europe.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following issues (A):
A. [2014] External nutrient inputs
Proposals should find innovative and effective strategies to improve the management of external nutrient inputs and water, and optimise their use efficiency at farm level to improve both yield and quality. Novel approaches could include integration of precision farming latest tools and techniques, such as advanced automation, variable rate applications, remote sensing, field and crop sensors, ICT technologies, to achieve a comprehensive strategy for optimising external nutrient inputs and water management in European intensive agriculture and provide significant progress beyond the current state of the art. Novel technologies and approaches should allow reaching improved sustainability in different intensive crop production systems, decreasing negative impacts on the environment and providing better product quality and benefits to human health. In-field demonstration of the proposed technologies on a relevant scale to prove concept feasibility should also be foreseen. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 8 million for (A) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact: Proposals should show how some, or all, of the following impacts will be achieved:
         Improvement of ground and surface water quality.
         Reduction of soil contaminations with toxic compounds and heavy metals.
         Conservation of biodiversity and wildlife.
         Improved human health, through the reduced release of pollutants and GHGs.
         Scientific support to relevant EU policies[1]
         Sound scientific evaluation of benefits and drawbacks of soil-improving cropping systems and techniques.
         Reduction of soil erosion and improvement of soil quality and structure  
         Increased European farmers’ competitiveness through the reduction of production costs.
         Reduction of the negative environmental impact of crop production through less soil disturbance, better exploitation of soil biodiversity and functions and more rational use of external inputs, water and natural resource base.

Specific Challenge: To remain competitive, limit environmental degradation and optimise the efficient use of resources, the development of more resource-efficient and sustainable food production and processing, throughout the food system, at all scales of business, in a competitive and innovative way is required. Current food production and processing systems, especially in the SME sector, need to be revised and optimised with the aim of achieving a significant reduction in water and energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation, while at the same time improving the efficiency in the use of raw materials, increasing climate resilience and ensuring or improving shelf life, food safety and quality. New competitive eco-innovative processes should be developed, within the framework of a transition towards a more resource-efficient, sustainable circular economy.
Scope: The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50,000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of Sustainable Food Security and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research.  For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
 Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.

","Research and Innovation action
","04 October 2016
","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Despite having stricter standards and limitations on external inputs, organic agriculture still uses a number of products that are allowed under the EU organic regulation only due to a lack of economically and technically viable alternatives. Some are the subject of concern or not fully in line with organic principles. The most controversial practice in this respect is the use of copper as a plant protection product, but there is also an urgent need for alternatives to the use of mineral oils (for plant protection), manure from non-organic farms, synthetic vitamins and provitamins used in animal production, etc. Work needs to be done to develop alternatives to such contentious inputs, including preventive farm-management methods.
Scope:
Projects should provide a comprehensive overview of the current use of and need for external inputs in various types of organic plant and animal farming systems. Activities proposed should be aimed at reducing or gradually phasing out contentious inputs without compromising the competitiveness of the organic sector. Work shall identify and develop alternatives to contentious inputs and analyse the socio-economic conditions required for their adoption. The products and management practices developed should be tested in different pedo-climatic and farming conditions in the EU, allowing for wide geographical coverage within Europe, associated countries and relevant third countries. Projects should take into account the results and conclusions of previous research projects in the area. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
widely accessible and cost-efficient alternatives to contentious inputs in organic farming. Better knowledge of alternatives will also allow for reduced inputs in conventional agriculture;
enhanced organic production, quality and stability;
reduced environmental impact of organic and low-input farming systems;
fair, reliable and implementable rules on the use of inputs in organic production; and

","27 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Xylella fastidiosa - a regulated harmful organism in the EU - has been detected in Italy where it is causing severe damage in particular to olive trees. There is growing concern over its potential to spread and establish throughout Europe and affect a significant number and range of host species (about 300). The potential consequences are major and could result in significant yield losses and costly control measures not just in olive trees but also in other economically important crops such as grapes, citrus fruits, stone fruits and almonds. A recent EFSA scientific opinion has confirmed the significant threat to plant health and European agriculture posed by the pest, amongst others because of X. fastidiosa's high levels of genetic plasticity and the fact that hosts can be infected without displaying any symptoms.
Scope:
Proposals will set out a comprehensive package of research and innovation actions to improve the prevention, early detection and control of X. fastidiosa in hosts and vectors. They shall increase knowledge on the biology of the pathogen and vector(s), on host/vector/pathogen interaction and epidemiology. Work shall target both the Apulian strain of X. fastidiosa and other strains that could represent a serious risk in the EU. Practical guidelines and integrated solutions for crop and disease management shall be developed to detect early, control outbreak and prevent spread of the disease in conventional and organic farming systems. Prevention measures should consider the introduction and spread of X. fastidiosa within and from outside the EU. Activities will support the development of region-specific risk assessment and eradication plans. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1], ensuring solid collaboration between research, plant health authorities and farming sector. International collaboration is highly encouraged with partners from Third Countries affected by the pest in particular to capitalise on existing knowledge. Activities should also take into account ongoing and/or recent work, e.g. funded under the EUPHRESCO ERA-NET.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to grant agreement N° 635646 - Pest Organisms Threatening Europe (POnTE). The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
Expected Impact:
Results of the work will significantly enhance the capacity of farmers and plant health authorities to manage the disease and prevent further economic losses in crops. Activities and information gained will help to:
gain more detailed knowledge in particular on the relevant European strain(s) of Xylella fastidiosa along with its hosts and vectors;
develop validated and harmonised methods and tools for early detection, treatment and control;
establish more effective mechanisms and tools for risk assessment and prevention, as well as guidelines for eradication;
provide the farming sector with adequate information and tools to tackle the disease throughout the agronomic cycle in various agro-ecological conditions;
inform breeding activities for more resistant plant varieties.
In the longer term, the results of the work will help to ensure that European agriculture remains productive and delivers quality products that meet the expectations of consumers and the food chain.

Trade and the movement of goods and people have facilitated the transfer and spread of plant and animal diseases and pests, the prevalence of which is expected to increase further as a result of intensification, changes in agricultural practices and climatic variations. Emerging diseases and pests in plants or emerging infectious diseases in terrestrial animals can have a substantial impact on agricultural and forest productivity, trade and public health. African Swine Fever is such a highly infectious animal disease emerging in Europe, with an epidemiological situation raising serious concerns and for which a vaccine would be very useful to improve its control. Appropriate and rapid responses by decision-makers need to be informed by scientific evidence, addressing as far as possible all components of management in particular with regard to epidemiology (e.g. source, transmissibility, susceptible species), host-pathogen interactions, diagnostics, means of prevention and control, as well as risk management.
Scope:
Proposals will contribute to understanding the drivers of emergence and to finding adequate responses to emerging pests and diseases in plants (work on Xylella fastidiosa is excluded under this call topic) and emerging infectious diseases in terrestrial animals. They will target one or more of the pests and diseases threatening EU agriculture/forestry (regulated or non-regulated, invasive or native) and causing significant economic losses, such as African Swine Fever. The choice of target species should consider the potential threat in terms of development and spread as well as potential impact on agricultural production, public health, or trade. Proposals should increase knowledge on the biology, development and spread of pests/diseases. They should improve methods and strategies for risk assessment, prevention and containment and enlarge the range of tools for integrated and sustainable pest/disease management. International cooperation with countries affected or threatened by the same pest(s)/disease(s) is encouraged. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1] and be based on the active participation of stakeholders from research, plant/animal health authorities and the farming and business sectors. Partners from non-EU regions particularly affected by the targeted pests and disease(s) should also be involved. As regards livestock, proposals should contribute as appropriate to the objectives of the STAR-IDAZ[2] international research consortium (see SFS-12-2016). They should involve cooperation as appropriate with relevant initiatives, e.g. in the context of such as EUPHRESCO and STAR-IDAZ, and other funded projects in this field, e.g. those selected under SFS-14-2016.
Individual proposals should tackle either plant pests/diseases or animal infectious diseases. Funding will allow for support for up to two projects on plant pests/diseases and one animal diseases.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Knowledge and solutions generated by this action should contribute to:
understanding drivers for pest/disease emergence
improved management of pests/diseases by the farming and forestry sectors;
development of environmentally sound tools for the prevention, detection and diagnosis, of pests/diseases;
reduction of economic losses by the farming and forestry sectors;

A. [2016] Organic farming and food production
Scope: In recent years the organic market in the EU, driven by steadily increasing demand, has developed significantly (EUR 19.7 billion with a 9% growth rate in 2011). While demand for organic products tends to exceed production, during the last decade, the number of organic producers and the surface area under organic production have grown rapidly. Every year, 500,000 hectares of agricultural land in the EU are converted to organic farming. In the period 2000-2012, the total organic area increased by 6.7% a year on average, reaching an estimated 9.6 million hectares, or 5.4% of the EU’s total utilised agricultural area. Organic aquaculture is also growing fast following the introduction of EU rules in 2009. The overall aim is to improve jobs and growth in the organic sector by improving organic farming and food chains and, consolidating funding for transnational research and innovation activities. This ERA-NET Cofund is a follow-up to CORE Organic I (FP6) and CORE Organic 2 (FP7). At a policy development level, this is in line with the Commission Communication on the action plan for organic production in the European Union, the existing regulations in the organic sector and the Commission proposal for a new regulation on organic production (COM(2014)180) as it will increase the innovative capacity of the sector if certain exemptions are phased out.
Expected Impact: More sustainable agricultural production systems, food processing and food value chains through the further development of organic products and fulfilment of the rising demand for organic products, support for the Common Agricultural Policy and organic farming regulations and other relevant policy areas, e.g. health, trade and jobs. More specifically, projects developed under the proposed Cofund action will: i) improve the production potential under organic regulations; ii) improve the sustainability of agricultural production; iii) improve animal welfare and resource efficiency; and iv) link up to innovation needs of European Innovation Partnership operational groups.
B. [2016] Sustainable food production and consumption
Scope: Achieving a sustainable food supply that incorporates new food processing technologies and that is supported by consumer acceptance, is an innovation priority for the food industry and civil society organisations. A SUSFOOD (“SUStainable FOOD production and consumption”) ERA-NET Cofund will seek to increase collaboration and coordination on national research into the sustainability of food production and consumption, with the main focus on the food supply chain beyond the farm gate. The 7th Framework Programme (FP7) experience has shown that there is still potential to organize and implement calls for proposals on this issue with excellent chances of a good rate of return on the money invested. The Commission's national consultations, held in 16 European countries, show there is a common desire to continue efforts to keep food sustainability high on the research and innovation agenda. There is also a willingness to provide the necessary funding. Proposals should take into consideration (and can build on previous) EU-funded activities in this field.
Expected Impact: Innovation in food processing technologies; redesign of input, waste and side flow strategies to increase resource efficiency and provide added value in food products and processing, manufacture etc.; interdisciplinary research approach to innovation in food products and use of new raw materials for food products; harmonisation of the methods and metrics for the integrated assessment of the sustainability of food products and food patterns; link between stakeholders and food systems; greater understanding of consumer behaviour and food choices; integration of information systems for personalized, sustainable choices.
C. [2016] A knowledge platform for the intestinal microbiome
Scope: For many years it has been known that the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome affect the conversion and availability of some dietary components. There is a growing body of evidence on complex host-diet-microbiota interactions, highlighting the need to consider these interconnections as a triad that will define the success of dietary interventions and European policies. Importantly, there is mounting evidence to suggest that the intestinal microbiome affects both gut and systemic health. Specifically, diet-related variations in the gut microbiota have been linked to a variety of non-communicable chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and auto-immune, brain and cardiovascular diseases.
Gut microbiota analysis and modulation is a new and rapidly developing research area. However, the causal relationship between diet, gut microbiota and human health is still poorly understood. These studies may provide new strategies for health promotion and disease prevention, development of healthy ingredients and foods bearing health claims as well as probiotics and prebiotics based on functional analysis of genomic and metagenomic data. There is a need for joint research activities relating to the intestinal microbiome, particularly to share and integrate existing data, investigate the 'cause and effect' relationship between changes in microbiota composition and disease (including the role of human genetics), to identify the main dietary components that lead to functional changes in gut microbial composition, as well as to standardise methods and study designs to analyse and understand the human diet-gut microbiota interaction.
Expected Impact: This ERA-NET Cofund should generate new knowledge to support health maintenance, prevention strategies and/or new treatments. It should shed light on the human diet-gut microbiota interaction in relation to health and disease. It should also create a knowledge base for intervention studies aimed at promoting health and/or preventing the onset/development of non-communicable chronic disease through diet-dependent modulation of the intestinal microbiota.
D. [2017] Sustainable crop production
Scope: To pool resources and know-how to develop and test solutions for sustainable crop production, including areas such as breeding, nutrient recycling and soil-plant-atmosphere interactions, plant health and protection, management practices and the added value of agricultural products.
Expected Impact: Activities will contribute to developing cropping systems with improved performance in terms of reduced environmental impacts, resource-use efficiency and product quality. This will help the farming sector adapt to changes expected to result e.g. from emerging resource scarcity, environmental variation, demography, consumer preferences, and global trade.
E. [2017] Innovative forest-based bioeconomy
Scope: Forests cover more than 40 % of the EU's landmass and are instrumental in a number of key policy areas. The forest-based sector provides income for 16 million owners, supports 3-4 million jobs in rural areas, represents some 8% of the EU's total manufacturing value; removes the equivalent of approximately 9 % of greenhouse gases emitted by other parts of the economy; and provides for a wide range of other social, economic and ecological services. The proposed Cofund action will promote increased innovation and competitiveness of the forest-based sector in Europe and support its transformation from a resource-intensive to a knowledge-intensive, productive, resource-efficient and resilient sector. Sustainability and modernisation of forestry systems and downstream value chains including innovative business concepts and production technologies will be needed to develop the forestry sector and the European bioeconomy, of which forestry accounts for a large share. Basic and applied research, close-to-market research and innovation actions are all envisaged. The scope spans all forest-based value chains, from forest vitality and sustainability of forestry production systems to efficiency in supplying forest-based goods (wood and non-wood) and services.
Expected Impact: Enhanced resilience of forest ecosystems and forestry production systems to natural disturbances (including pests and diseases), connected to watershed and landscape management; sustainable provision of forest biomass for the European bioeconomy, ecosystem services and non-wood forest products; development of new sustainable and resource-efficient value chains and consolidation of the existing ones; development of new knowledge and processes to support major transitions and innovations in the forest-based sector, supporting business development in rural areas and industrial development, in crucial sectors such as forest-based industries (traditional and emerging branches), construction, transport and energy; increased resource efficiency (e.g. water, energy) and climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration in forest and wood-based products); and contribution to the implementation of key EU policy areas such as rural development, biodiversity, climate change, industrial policy, circular economy and bioeconomy.
Expected Impact:
Improve coordination and reduce the overlap between national and EU funding in relevant fields of research;
achieve a critical mass and ensure better use of limited resources in fields of mutual interest;
share good practice on implementing research programmes;
promote transnational collaboration and new knowledge generation and innovation;
involve small and medium-sized business in transnational projects, if appropriate, to enhance innovation.
map on-going research activities (where appropriate);
establish a network of research activities carried out at national and regional level, including a mutual opening of national and regional research programmes (where appropriate).

Agriculture and the agri-food sector are integral parts of the economy and society in Europe. They are subject to multiple external pressures, such as rising demand for food, feed, fuel and fibres, globalisation, environmental changes and public health considerations. They are also constrained by physical limits such as the availability of land and water. Demand for animal food products and competition for natural resources are expected to increase. This implies that agriculture and agri-food sector will need to become more efficient and sustainable.

","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
More efficient fisheries management, based on science, is needed to support the continued need to manage European fisheries, the global rise in seafood demand and the need to maximise fish production sustainably. Our understanding of the biology and ecology of several fish and other seafood species is far from complete for stocks fished in European seas and in particular for multi-species fisheries. This also applies in some areas outside EU waters where EU fleets fish. Relevant stocks include species in international waters or in the waters of third countries with which the EU has signed sustainable fisheries partnership agreements. For species fished outside EU waters, the challenge often extends beyond gathering knowledge of biological characteristics to include research on management tools and appropriate stock assessment models.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on an identified number of fisheries that are important for the fishing fleets of multiple EU countries and should respond to the priorities of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The proposals should review existing knowledge and perform multidisciplinary research to help close important knowledge gaps that have a significant impact on the management of key target and by-catch species and that currently limit the advice that relevant bodies can give. Research results should be able to be applied immediately to provide a more solid knowledge base and advice on fisheries management.
Proposals should cover one of the following geographical scopes:
1 [2016] Knowledge base and management tools for resilient and resource-efficient fisheries in waters of third countries with which the EU has signed sustainable fisheries partnership agreements and in international waters covered by regional fisheries management organisations other than the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.
2 [2017] Strengthening the knowledge base for resilient and resource-efficient fisheries in EU waters and in international waters covered by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
To improve fisheries management under the Common Fisheries Policy, including outside of EU waters, proposals should:
Increase the knowledge base, share new findings, provide new tools and promote their uptake by end-users to more efficiently manage fish stocks of interest to the EU, both inside and outside EU waters.
Increase the long-term profitability of the EU fleet and increase the number of jobs in the fishing sector.
Improve market supply and food security in Europe through a significant, predictable and sustainable provision of seafood from all areas in which EU vessels operate.
Contribute to adjusting fishing exploitation to levels that ensure the maximum sustainable yield.

Resource efficiency in the fishing sector and its improvement has many dimensions, including in particular extraction, scientific assessment of fish stocks and monitoring for scientific or surveillance purposes. While promising new technologies are being developed in several fields (e.g. information technology, new detection, monitoring and surveillance techniques, new materials, aerospace, etc.) the pace of their introduction in the fishing sector is far from optimal. It is generally assumed that fishing, control and data collection are under-performing, may lack accuracy, and are unnecessarily expensive. The extraction sector could largely benefit by improving cost-efficiency and compliance, and limiting its environmental impact by taking advantage of technological progress. Knowledge, monitoring, surveillance and assessment of resources could similarly be improved by using modern technologies, including for instance unmanned vehicles or drone-like devices. The challenge lies in identifying the possibilities and ways to improve the uptake of high-level technology throughout the fisheries value chain, and the possibilities of improving resource efficiency for fishing operations and the activities surrounding them (e.g. monitoring, data, knowledge).
Scope:
The proposals should explore opportunities to increase the use of innovative technologies in all fisheries-related activities, including the extractive sector, the collection of data and information and the monitoring of compliance with the rules. Proposals should assess the innovative potential and applicability of new technologies in the fishing sector with the aim of avoiding unnecessary fish mortality, damage to other marine resources and ecosystems; improving energy efficiency; and increasing overall economic efficiency and social acceptability. The expected results should be directly applicable to important fisheries in all European seas. The participation of SMEs that will benefit from the intellectual property and/or from the commercial use of the project outcomes is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
To improve resource efficiency in the fishing sector, proposals should:
Identify existing technologies and their potential for use in the fishing sector, bring these to a readiness level that means they can be used by the fishing sector across the EU and promote their uptake by end users.
Improve the performance of fishing vessels in terms of resource efficiency, including effective use of resources for data collection and fish stock assessment.
Reduce the cost of marine monitoring.
Improve economic efficiency and profitability, avoiding increasing unnecessary fishing pressures and undermining sustainable resource use.
Involve the fishing sector in collecting evidence for implementing marine policies.
Improve compliance and reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries.
Support the implementation of the EU Common Fisheries Policy and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.
Improve the professional skills and competences of those working and being trained to work within the blue economy."

Mediterranean aquaculture contributes to food security, employment and trade in the region. Its competitiveness can be increased by improving its technical performance together with a shift from production-oriented growth to market-oriented and consumer responsive approach. To ensure sustainable growth of the Mediterranean aquaculture industry, farms must operate not only in ideal economic and environmental conditions but also in a socially and culturally responsible manner.
Scope:
Proposals should integrate and improve the technical viability of the current production systems for Mediterranean aquaculture, including biological and operational aspects, using new and cost-effective innovative technologies and practices to ensure the sector's sustainability and growth. In particular, proposals should substantially improve current key performance indicators (KPI) used for the principal Mediterranean species: growth rates, mortality and feed efficiency. They should also develop tools for marker-assisted selection and look at Mediterranean aquaculture market development, to develop strategic marketing plans for the promotion, product development and commercialisation of Mediterranean aquaculture production in new and existing markets. Where appropriate, proposals should make use of national and international research infrastructure programmes and services such as the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, to better support a regional management approach. The participation of SMEs that will benefit from the intellectual property and/or from the commercial use of the project outcomes is encouraged.
In line with the objective of the EU Strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area [1].

Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
To improve the competitiveness of EU Mediterranean aquaculture production, proposals will have to:
Consolidate Mediterranean aquaculture production for key species towards a commercial scale through sustainable fish farming and valuable seafood production.
Draw up solid marketing plans for local and regional production which will boost jobs and trade in the region.
Develop a code of conduct and good practices and harmonised standards across the Mediterranean to promote responsible aquaculture practices in the region.
Improve the image of aquaculture production systems and products supported by market-oriented production and a consumer responsive approach.
Increase consumer awareness of high quality and safe products from Mediterranean aquaculture that certify freshness, traceability, animal welfare[2] and the sustainability of the systems.

","04 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Tackling both quantity and quality of water in small agricultural catchments provides a number of advantages. The number of hydrological processes and interactions can be analysed in detail which is not the case for large scale hydrological analyses. Usually issues of natural/small water retention[1] can be properly tackled at the smaller scale of an agricultural catchment. Equally, the local impact of climate change or/and changes in local micro-climate can also be analysed in an integrated way with other challenges of small scale catchments. At the level of the small agricultural catchment, water management supports not only sustainable agricultural production but also local ecosystems. A sufficient supply of water for sustainable crop production might become more important in the coming years. At the same time a number of underutilised techniques of water management (natural/small water retention, nutrients recovery from streams, etc.) could be re-introduced into agricultural management for the benefit of farmers, local communities and the environment.
Scope:
Activities shall assess the use of small water retention approaches for managing excess and shortage of water and nutrient recovery from water streams. The link between agricultural land management and soil-water management for increased nutrient uptake and water retention should be assessed. Work should focus on affordable and easy-to-implement at the farm level solutions including an economic analysis of proposed measures as well as maintenance of the infrastructure. The analysis of proposed techniques for water management should consider the need for adaptation to climate change and its impact on ecosystem services. Work should allow assessing long-term benefits for the farm and the local ecosystem from the implementation of the natural/small water retention measures. Proposals should fall under the ‘multi-actor approach’[2] ensuring cooperation between farmers and farmers associations, local water management organization, technology providers, research centres and public administration. Preference will be given to proposals focusing on Continental, Pannonia and Boreal biogeographical regions of Europe as defined by the European Environment Agency.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution form the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed properly. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
In the short to medium term:
Improved understanding of how small water retention within different climatic zones can contribute to water-use efficiency at the farm level;
Identification of tools and techniques for stream nutrients recovery and re-use of water at the scale of the agricultural catchment;
Identification of economically sustainable technologies for dry and wet spell water management at the farm and catchment levels.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With 90% of all world aquaculture production based in Asia, and with Europe importing close to 70% of its seafood (in particular from South-East Asia[1]), both regions have an interest in working together to develop sustainable solutions, since production has to nearly double in the next decade to meet the increasing seafood market demand. Sustainable aquaculture production is a major challenge for global seafood security and safety. In order to provide greater benefits for the EU and South-East Asian countries and to make future aquaculture sustainable, more work is needed on technology innovation, resource efficiency, reduced environmental impact, harmonised standards and marketing.
Scope:
Proposals should draw up a plan to launch a multi-stakeholder platform to reinforce international cooperation between Europe and South-East Asian countries on food security and safety with specific emphasis on sustainable aquaculture production and contributing to European competitiveness. The multi-stakeholder platform should support structuring new networks and partnerships between industrial players aiming to enhance business opportunities and the up-take of innovations in promising aquaculture domains. Those participating in the platform should also contribute to the development of common standards for appropriate environmental planning/zoning, increased food safety, and improved farming governance. Additionally, there should be particular focus on reinforcing capacity building by aligning European training programmes, including through industrial apprenticeship opportunities and networking with South-East Asian partners.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.
Expected Impact:
To contribute to the creation of a long-term partnership between Europe and South-East Asian countries on sustainable aquaculture and to reinforce the mutual benefits of science diplomacy between the regions, proposals will have to:
Contribute to common standard setting and legislation, particularly around ecosystem-based farming.
Facilitate the creation of business opportunities for industrial partnerships between Europe and South-East Asian countries.
Reduce risks to animal and human health and thus increase EU consumer’s confidence in seafood products.
Consolidate EU-South-East Asian education and training networks.
Contribute to reinforce targeted international cooperation on sustainable aquaculture production between EU and South East-Asian countries, supporting the EU-ASEAN Partnership[2] and the underlying EU-ASEAN High-level Policy Dialogue on science, technology and innovation.
Improve the professional skills and competences for those working and being trained to work within the blue economy.

Sustainable soil management is paramount to keep soils in a good status for both agriculture and environmental needs. Over the past years, our understanding of the various threats to soil functions has increased. The recent, more in depth analysis of the importance of soil biodiversity for delivering important ecosystem services has identified major knowledge gaps on its role for the degradation of waste materials and for agricultural productivity. The extensive use of plastics, products containg plastic and other emerging contaminants in daily life has not only impacts on oceans but also on soils. The understanding of the impact and fate of micro- and nano-plastics and other stressors on soils is very limited and needs assessing. Following recent assessments of land degradation by IPBES and IPCC, there is also a need to evaluate the economic, social and environmental costs of soil and land degradation.
Scope:
Proposals should address only one of the following sub-topics:
A. [2020]: Emerging challenges for soil management: Soil biodiversity assessment (RIA)
Proposals shall cover soil biodiversity analysis, including relevant microbes and invertebrates for soil-mediated ecosystem services. Proposals shall address soil management, exploring the links between soil biodiversity, its functions and land degradation to increase economic, environmental and social wellbeing of biogeographical regions of Europe. Proposals shall cover ecosystem stressors on soil and more particularly on soil biodiversity and its potential impact on ecosystem functions.
Work shall build on the existing initiatives[1] and provide support to relevant Member State commitments under the Global Soil Partnership. If relevant cooperation and complementarities could also be sought with projects funded by other Societal Challenges[2]. International cooperation is encouraged.
B. [2020]: Emerging challenges for soil management: use of plastic in agriculture (RIA)
Proposals shall cover analysis of the use of plastic in agricultural production and its impact on soil. The particular focus of the proposals should be on the micro-plastic after harvest and its fate in the environment. The potential future impact of micro-plastic on soil biodiversity and its potential transfer to other parts of the environment and beyond should be analysed.
Activities shall also analyse the impact of micro- and nano-plastics on soil properties and its ecosystem services function. In addition the focus of this analysis should be concentrated on the use of plastic during agricultural production at the field level but also at the farm level. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[3]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Understand the current status, challenges and potential of soil biodiversity (sub-scope A);
Understand the impact of micro- and nano-plastics on soil biodiversity and ecosystem services (sub-scope B);
Understand the impact of micro- and nano-plastics and other stressors in soil on agricultural productivity and ecosystem services (sub-scope B);
Understand and assess the chemical changes and disaggregation of micro- and nano-plastics in soils, their impacts and further behaviour in soils (including soil physics) (sub-scope B);
Quantify the economic, environmental and social consequences of unsustainable soil management in different biogeographical regions (sub-scopes A and B);

More efficient fisheries management, based on science, is needed to support the continued need to manage European fisheries, the global rise in seafood demand and the need to maximise fish production sustainably. Our understanding of the biology and ecology of several fish and other seafood species is far from complete for stocks fished in European seas and in particular for multi-species fisheries. This also applies in some areas outside EU waters where EU fleets fish. Relevant stocks include species in international waters or in the waters of third countries with which the EU has signed sustainable fisheries partnership agreements. For species fished outside EU waters, the challenge often extends beyond gathering knowledge of biological characteristics to include research on management tools and appropriate stock assessment models.
Scope:
Proposals should focus on an identified number of fisheries that are important for the fishing fleets of multiple EU countries and should respond to the priorities of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The proposals should review existing knowledge and perform multidisciplinary research to help close important knowledge gaps that have a significant impact on the management of key target and by-catch species and that currently limit the advice that relevant bodies can give. Research results should be able to be applied immediately to provide a more solid knowledge base and advice on fisheries management.
Proposals should cover one of the following geographical scopes:
1 [2016] Knowledge base and management tools for resilient and resource-efficient fisheries in waters of third countries with which the EU has signed sustainable fisheries partnership agreements and in international waters covered by regional fisheries management organisations other than the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.
2 [2017] Strengthening the knowledge base for resilient and resource-efficient fisheries in EU waters and in international waters covered by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.

To improve fisheries management under the Common Fisheries Policy, including outside of EU waters, proposals should:
Increase the knowledge base, share new findings, provide new tools and promote their uptake by end-users to more efficiently manage fish stocks of interest to the EU, both inside and outside EU waters.
Increase the long-term profitability of the EU fleet and increase the number of jobs in the fishing sector.
Improve market supply and food security in Europe through a significant, predictable and sustainable provision of seafood from all areas in which EU vessels operate.
Contribute to adjusting fishing exploitation to levels that ensure the maximum sustainable yield.

Aquaculture is an attractive and important component of rural and coastal livelihoods providing employment and facilitating a sustainable economy by means of business development and diversification. The opportunities for growth of the aquaculture industry in the EU remain substantial given the potential for innovation with respect to culture techniques, technological advances, species and product diversification. European aquaculture production is expected to sustainably increase by continuously pursuing ways and means of improving production practices, to make them more efficient and cost-effective while improving resource use and environmental management. This sustainable eco-intensification of the European aquaculture industry has been identified as a major challenge ahead in order to meet global fish and seafood security needs for future generations.
Scope:
Proposals should support aquaculture production and communities with cost-effective innovative solutions and technologies that ensure sustainable offshore, coastal and inland development and growth. They should look at strengthening integrated aquaculture activities (species and systems) in a sustainable way, by implementing new/emerging technologies and innovations in monitoring and management systems and focusing on sound economic reduction of operational costs related to innovative aquaculture production systems while enhancing fish health and welfare. The participation of SMEs that will benefit from the intellectual property and/or from the commercial use of the project outcomes is encouraged.

Food safety in the food chain is a basis for effective functioning of national and international markets with trust and transparency. Food safety risks occur along the food chain from a number of biological and chemical contaminants. In addition, malpractices or fraudulent practices could also lead to increased food safety risks. Improving risk assessment and monitoring, including the use of big data, is of major importance. Developing integrated approaches along the entire food chain for detecting, assessing, and mitigating relevant pathogens and contaminant hazards is essential. It implies efficient food safety control systems, supported by reliable authentication and traceability approaches, being implemented across the entire food chain, focusing on the combination of hazard monitoring and control options in the specific stages of the food chain where the impact would be greater, or combinations of these at multiple stages. This is in particular challenging for SMEs which is a predominant entrepreneurial model across the agri-food sector, both in the EU and China.
Scope:
Proposals should look at the development of an integrated approach for detecting, assessing and mitigating food safety risks from biological and chemical hazards (whether emerging or not) through the entire food chain/s (from primary production to consumers) and include common risks such as environmental contamination, process contamination, contamination through packaging and misuse or adulteration. They should tackle specific sector/s while taking into account the diversity of the supply chains within sector(s). The research activities should gather relevant data to assess risks and deliver practical solutions (technology and management related) in order to control those hazards and their combinations at specific stages of the food chain where interventions can deliver the most efficient and greatest possible impact on public health. Activities will develop detection and monitoring tools that will allow for the data collection, integration, validation and analysis. Proposals will establish and validate non-targeted and targeted rapid detection methods for the screening and identification of biological and chemical hazards. Special attention will be given to developing and/or improving systems ensuring process efficacy and validation for hazard control. Proposed activities will encompass work within the food safety risk analysis framework while at the same time developing simple and practical decision support tools tailored towards the needs of agri-food sector (SMEs in particular) and scientific stakeholders. Proposals will fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1] and allow for the adequate involvement of SMEs and food safety control authorities. Proposals should include a task to cluster with other project/s financed under this topic and ensure complementarity with activities of EU-China-Safe project funded in response to the topic ""SFS-45-2016: Increase overall transparency of processed agri-food products"". Proposals shall promote balanced research and innovation cooperation between the EU and China. China-based entities that will participate in joint projects with European partners under Horizon 2020 have also the possibility to apply for funding under the Chinese co-funding mechanism.

Expected Impact:
Overall, activities will improve food safety control systems (implementation, inspection and controls) along the food chain.
In the short to medium term work will:
Ensure and enhance the transparency and reliability of food safety along the entire food chain (including the e-commerce mean) with regard to international trade and internal EU and Chinese markets;
Enhance the capacity of food SMEs and operators along the chain to detect, assess and mitigate food safety risks stemming from relevant pathogens, contaminant hazards and counterfeit food;
Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the controls performed by the food safety authorities along the food chain;

Production, protection and remediation are the three major components for securing global food supply on limited land resources for the growing global population. As competition between urban, industrial/transportation and agricultural land uses increases, food production needs to be maintained on decreasing land areas. To achieve a new balance on a higher output level, with possibly less input is the ultimate goal of resource use efficiency, sustainable management and competitiveness of agriculture. Land suitability-based management with prioritisation of targets (outputs) has to be in place and life cycle assessment of nutrient flows need to be included. Harmonisation between environmental and social targets has to be made on the basis of common/harmonised data and parameters of soil and land. Research should focus more on priority areas in the optimisation of land use and environmental protection taking into consideration the specific ecological and socio-economic conditions in China and Europe.
Scope:
Harmonising land information is crucial for building common understanding of the resource base, with special regard to prime land. Harmonisation should be based on the Eurasian coverage of the new global soil map, incorporating local soil information. Indicators for sustainable intensification and delineation of both prime agricultural land and problem lands should be defined. Options for a trade-off between ecology and productivity should be demonstrated for both productive and less productive land. Influence of climate change and impact of land use change should be incorporated to the models, especially targeting the loss of prime land. The achievement of a new balance should also consider the socio-economic context. In order to achieve the suitability-based highly-efficient land resources management, focus has to be on soil properties (carbon in particular), nutrient input to soil (N, P, K) and N fixation. Proposals shall promote balanced research and innovation cooperation between the EU and China. China-based entities that will participate in joint projects with European partners under Horizon 2020 have also the possibility to apply for funding under the Chinese co-funding mechanism.

The Fourth EU-Africa Summit of 2-3 April 2014 agreed on a roadmap for 2014-2017[1] including actions specifically targeted at delivering Earth observation services in priority domains for Africa such as food security. This topic aims to contribute to this roadmap by providing food supply projection and agricultural risk assessment for Africa. These kinds of projection remain very challenging tasks, requiring a lot of information on environmental and weather conditions, climate change, crops and livestock. This information is usually derived from both remote and in-situ Earth observation systems. The challenge is therefore to make agricultural production in Africa more predictable by using Earth observation assets, including – but not limited to – those made available through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and Copernicus programmes.
Scope:
The action should lead to substantially increasing the use of Earth observing capabilities and supporting application systems to produce timely, objective, reliable, and transparent crop and livestock production projection at the national and regional level for the African continent. It should support the GEOGLAM[2] and AfriGEOSS[3] initiatives and relevant aspects of the EU's development policy. Moreover, it should design and develop methods to assess/monitor agricultural production in Africa, taking into account its main drivers and the longer term impacts of its dynamics. Building on the outcomes of existing EU projects stimulating innovation for global agricultural monitoring – such as SIGMA[4] –, the research and innovation activities should cover as a minimum all the following domains: crop and livestock identification and crop and livestock area estimation, crop and livestock condition and stress, yield prediction and forecasting, crop cover mapping, and the impact of extreme events on food production.
The action should foster participatory approaches to collecting relevant information and data, taking advantage of the growing number of mobile communication devices owned by African citizens. The participatory approaches should also take into account, and build on, widespread women’s engagement in agricultural production and food supply. There should be an emphasis on ‘consensus of evidence approaches’, integrating data from multiple sources including Earth observations, crop models, weather forecast, climate predictions and projections, surveys and ground observations to reach evidence-based assessments using repeatable and scientifically sound methods.
Large proof-of-concept actions, showing the capacity to deliver food supply prediction and agriculture risk assessment beyond the current state-of-the art at regional/pan-African level should be performed by the action. Proposals should contribute to supporting the implementation of an EU-Africa partnership on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture and should include partners clearly representing the diversity of African countries.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with African countries. The action should establish cooperation with institutions/networks engaged in the development of climate services in Africa and with agencies which have developed mapping and assessment tools used in humanitarian decision making.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to:
move projection of food supply and agricultural risk assessment at the level of the African continent beyond the current capability;
improve decision making capacity regarding food supply and management in Africa;
contribute to independent and neutral evaluation of agricultural production in Africa;
strengthen collaboration between EU and African organisations in the domain of food projection;
increased involvement of citizens and stakeholders in food production and food supply chain management in Africa, taking into account the gender dimension and women’s role in food production and supply;
provide a strong Earth observation building blocks for an EU-Africa Research and Innovation Partnership focusing on food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture;
improve participation of African organisations in GEO and Copernicus (GMES & Africa initiative);
foster cooperation with initiatives developing the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS)[5] in African countries;
contribute to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 2 'End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture' and SDG 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts'.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Access to food remains a global challenge, with 805 million people not having enough to eat (global hunger index 2014). Nutritional imbalances in Europe and Africa are increasing, characterised by persistent under-nutrition and growing diet-related diseases. It is projected that the global population will increase from 7 billion to more than 9 billion by 2050. The majority of this growth is expected to take place in Africa. Food availability needs to increase in the context of a changing climate with agricultural production systems under threat from extreme weather events, as well as in view of declining natural resources, particularly water, soil and biodiversity. Food losses from harvest to consumer households have to be reduced. Increasing the quantity of food produced will not be a sufficient answer in itself as food security is an issue not only of food production but also of access to food, affordability, stability of the food supply and the quality of that supply, beyond its basic calorie value. Hence there is a need to harness science and farmer knowledge to advance an innovation process.
Scope:
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national or international research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals. The call should result in grants to third parties with EU co-funding. To achieve these objectives, a long-term research and innovation partnership would lead to a joint and coordinated effort of African and European actors in an innovation system along the lines of three broad thematic areas:
Sustainable intensification: Providing food in a sustainable manner is a challenge in both Europe and Africa. They therefore have a common interest in research on sustainable intensification. Research and innovation actions are needed to both improve the production of food/fibre/biomass and of services (social, economic and environmental) and to reduce the environmental impact of such production and the depletion of natural resources. Ecological intensification approaches such as conservation agriculture, integrated pest management, organic agriculture, which optimise the use of ecosystem services to produce quality food in a competitive manner, include breeding of crops and animals, nutrient management and research on institutional innovations.
Agriculture and food systems for nutrition: Agricultural and food systems need to be changed to reduce waste and improve diets. Aquaculture and coastal fisheries should be part of the approach. Both under-nutrition and obesity are associated with micronutrient deficiency (food intake is low in minerals and vitamins), which affects two billion people worldwide. Research and innovation actions would look at developing low-waste food value chains to deliver more nutritionally-rich food to consumers. This should include urban agriculture and better rural-urban linkages. A better understanding of consumer behaviour in relation to healthy diets could help improve regulations, the education and incentive system.
Improvement of agricultural markets and trade: Agriculture remains a primary means of economic growth for many African countries. Market and trade development will play an important role in the creation of future jobs and growth, especially in rural areas. Europe is a major growth market for African agricultural exports. Research into improved global value chains would benefit small farmers and consumers alike and would expand the market opportunities for organic, fair-trade and other quality label production. It could also help operators in developing countries adapt to new regulatory conditions, such as the new rules on organic production currently being discussed.
The joint call must be implemented jointly by European and African countries and could include other national or international funders such as foundations, public and non-governmental agencies or international research programmes (e.g. CGIAR research programmes). The joint call should also build on earlier experiences of this kind of cooperation, such as the international ERA-NET, ERAfrica or the ERA-NET ERA-ARD. It should also launch calls for innovation projects building on research results obtained from previous projects in the domain. Proposals will be expected to establish relevant links with other projects concerning the preparation of the EU-Africa Research and Innovation Partnership on food and nutrition and sustainable agriculture.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Effective trans-national, European-African research and innovation networking and better coordination and synergies between national, international and EU research programmes relevant to food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture.
Support for the development of a long-term EU-Africa Research and Innovation Partnership on food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture, connecting research and innovation networks to local multi-stakeholder research and innovation processes.

","27 October 2015
","13 September 2016","Specific Challenge:
Legume crops are a critical source of plant-based proteins for people and animals. To date, however, they have not featured high on public or private sector research agendas. The EU and China are facing similar challenges, as both lack sources of protein and are increasingly dependent on protein imports for food and animal feed. In recent years (mainly due to continuous population growth and urbanisation), China has imported increasing volumes of soybeans, reaching 60 million tonnes in 2013 (corresponding to 60% of world market trade). This unique situation for a commodity will have important consequences on the equilibrium of the global market and might affect prices in the near future if imports increase further, as indicated by most recent long-term projections. The EU and China therefore have a common interest in cooperating on long-term strategies to develop sustainable alternatives to protein imports with a view to reducing their dependency and helping to stabilise the world market.
Scope:
Proposals will develop efficient long-term breeding strategies to improve diversification, crop productivity and stability, and the protein quality of (grain and forage) legume crops for human and animal food. Activities will seek to broaden the genetic base of legume crops for breeding purposes, analyse relevant and untapped genetic material and explore the scope for increased exchanges between the EU and China via mutual access to gene banks through open databases. Proposals will test plant performance (phenotyping) of a wide range of legume species and varieties in various geographic (climatic) and environmental situations in the EU and China, taking into account climate-change scenarios. Activities will identify species and varieties suited to a number of specific agro-ecological conditions: specific attention should be given to identifying resistance to combinations of biotic and abiotic stresses (including heat and drought stress tolerance). Proposals will make use of a wide range of breeding tools and methods available in the EU and China.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed properly. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Contributions for Chinese participants will come in addition and will be made available by China.
Expected Impact:
reduce overall long-term dependence of European and Chinese agricultural systems on protein imports;
enlarged range of genetic resources of legume crops available for use in breeding programmes;
enhanced common methods, tools and technologies for the characterisation and evaluation of new genetic resources;
improve mutual access to genetic resources;
new varieties adapted to local conditions in order to increase the overall productivity and quality of legume crops that should benefit both conventional and organic agriculture; and
new varieties adapted to biotic and abiotic stresses in the context of climate change.

","13 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
Soil is the largest terrestrial water reservoir and a decisive factor in crop production and yield variability. A shortage of water to sustain crop production systems and other agro-ecosystem services is a major issue in many Mediterranean areas of the EU and climatic projections suggest that precipitation will become increasingly variable and unreliable in the near future. As many parts of China are facing similar problems, there is a common interest in increasing cooperation on this key issue to promote sustainable production systems in a changing environment.
Scope:
Proposals will provide a platform for research on soil-water resources management based on a system approach by considering a number of regional climate scenarios in Europe and China. Activities will include the assessment of the function between crop yield variability and soil hydraulic properties by linking data and models from long-term experiments. Linkages between agricultural soil hydrology and threats will have to be systematically assessed and adaptation and mitigation methods provided, taking into account land-use dynamics, economic context and social aspects of soil water management. Proposals will develop and test good practices for sustainable on-farm water management and watershed practices adapted to local conditions (conventional and advanced technologies). Optimising circular approaches to re-use water and make use of waste water might also be envisaged in a comprehensive approach to water management in agricultural production systems.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Contributions for Chinese participants will come in addition and will be made available by China.
Expected Impact:
improved soil and water-use efficiency in agricultural production;
Identification of tools, mainly at farm level, to improve soils' water-holding capacities and plant productivity in the presence of drought or flood risks. To be effective, the practices need to be conducted at farm level and then upscaled regionally;
identification of new and advanced sustainable technologies for soil-water management that will efficiently reduce crop-yield variability and the impact of extreme weather events on crops; and
evaluation and study of water balances at watershed level and evaluation of crops' real 'water footprint'.

","09 November 2017","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to help overcome the current gaps in exploitation of promising research results in ICT for Health, Well-being and Ageing well and to stimulate increased availability and market uptake of relevant ICT products and services This concerns both interoperable and secure eHealth[1] solutions for consumers and institutional healthcare delivery building on standards and new ICT solutions and innovation ecosystems for ageing well building on open software platforms[2], in order to deliver new and more efficient care to European citizens and respond to new market opportunities for SMEs.
Particular attention should be given to potential for disruptive innovation and fast market up-take in ICT for health, wellbeing and ageing well. In particular it will be interesting for SMEs and young companies that are looking for swift support to their innovative ideas.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[3],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[4]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[5]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [6]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[7] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impacts should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

","SME instrument phase 2
","26 November 2015
","18 October 2017","Specific Challenge:
The healthcare biotechnology sector offers huge business and commercial opportunities; however it also requires heavy and risky investments which are often lacking in Europe, hampering the development of the industry.
The challenge includes either:
a) Cell technologies in medical applications (phase 1 only for 2016 deadlines and phase 2 for all deadlines in 2016 and 2017)
Cell technologies include cell manufacturing (culture, multiplication, scale-up and automation), preservation, banking and transport; identification, cell sorting and delivery, imaging, tracking, process and quality control; genetic engineering and gene editing; production of therapeutic biomolecules. The medical applications of cell technologies include diagnostics and biosensors; cell and gene therapy, tissue engineering, bio-artificial organs, haematology, immunotherapy, and vaccine and antibody production; predictive toxicology, synthetic biology, and modelling development and disease processes.
However, the diversity, complexity and variability of living cells pose challenges for bringing safe, reliable, regulatory-compliant and cost-effective products to the market and to the patient. SMEs developing cell-based products and processes have limited financial resources to take the critical steps to move from proof of concept to practical application while at the same time addressing considerations such as scale-up/scale-out, automation, logistics, regulatory pathways and business models.
Particular attention should be given to dialogue with regulators and compliance with safety and regulatory requirements, such as those pertaining to cell procurement, GMP, ethics, clinical trials, ATMPs and medical devices.
The challenge addresses cells from any eukaryotic source though their eventual application must be to human medicine.
Or:
b) Clinical research for the validation of biomarkers and/or diagnostic medical devices (only at the first cut-off date in 2017 and for phase 2 applications - phasing out of the topic PHC-12-2014/2015 introduced in the Work Programme 2014-2015)
Biomarkers are used in clinical practice to indicate both normal and pathological conditions. They are also used for predictive or prognostic purposes. They are being used increasingly in medicine and many potential new biomarkers are proposed every year. However, only a few of these have been validated for clinical use. To achieve validation a robust analytical method is required and a link to a pertinent clinical process or endpoint needs to be demonstrated.
This validation process should provide evidence for high analytical value, appropriate sensitivity and specificity, and clinical validity. Particular attention should be given to validation of biomarkers with potential for rapid uptake into clinical practice. Both in vivo and in vitro potential biomarkers are eligible. Priority is given to the validation of disease-related biomarkers (i.e. diagnostic, susceptibility/risk, monitoring and prognostic biomarkers). Validation of the clinical performance of new diagnostic devices can also be supported, either in combination with the biomarker validation or against existing standards.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies).

Reduction of food losses and waste on farm and along the value-chain
Creating added value from waste and by-products generated on farm and along the value-chain
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[1],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[2]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [4]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[5] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impacts should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).
Cross-cutting Priorities:
SME Instrument
[1]This is not limited to the costs of acquiring and enforcing European or international IPR titles but could include auditing and risk management schemes to protect IP assets across planned supply and distribution chains and more generally IP valorisation plans to enhance return on investment and lever commercial investment into the relevant project.
[2]In the case of SMEInst-05-2016-2017, research type activities in medical application and clinical validation, including support for clinical studies and trials, will be predominant and will necessitate reimbursement at 100%. The Technology Readiness Levels indication does not apply.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
The development of efficient, sustainable and flexible energy systems is a key challenge for Europe’s energy decarbonisation and a corner stone of Europe’s 2050 climate-neutrality goal, set out in the European Green Deal. To achieve such viable energy system, a particular support should be given to solutions aimed at increasing lifetime and decrease the cost of the overall system. In this context, Hydrogen (H2) has the potential to contribute to the above mentioned objectives.Currently H2 is largely produced from fossil fuels, commonly referred to as grey H2, or promising but still expensive blue H2 options, combining methane-to- H2 with carbon capture and storage, or renewable H2 pathways (green H2), entirely based on renewable electricity. Referring to green H2 production, the state of art technology is based on water electrolysis, with costs still higher than grey H2 and production processes affected by the use of critical raw materials.
This Pathfinder Challenge aims at developing novel processes and technologies to produce green H2, at different scales (from small to large) and capturing cross sectorial coupling and system integration opportunities, entirely based on (i) renewable sources and (ii) non-toxic, non-critical raw materials. It focuses on the potentials of new biological, chemical, and physical routes for green H2 production which could also facilitate the implementation of the circular economy principles, possibly including the co-production of decarbonised chemicals. The specific target is to support the development of innovative technologies and platforms for green H2 production, including both centralised and/or on-demand generation (i.e. at the premises of the end users and for onsite consumption). Reaching these objectives requires multidisciplinary competencies and cross sectorial approaches addressing also environmental, industrial and logistic issues.
Specific conditions for this challenge
In order to apply, your proposal should develop a proof of concept or lab-scale validated innovative green H2 production technology by biological, chemical or physical routes without the deployment of fossil fuels, potentially including the use of salt or waste water, air moisture, biomass or recycled by-products, or the co-production of decarbonised chemicals.
Projects with multidisciplinary and cross sectorial approaches, looking for inspiration, ideas and knowledge in disciplines that are typically not in this kind of research, are particularly welcome. Projects are strongly encouraged to consider the recovery and recycling of by-products and wastes (circular approach), as well as the use of abundant natural resources. The safe and sustainable use of non-critical raw materials is mandatory and the projects should include a full life cycle analysis of the proposed solutions and their impact on Europe’s decarbonisation goals.

","15 June 2021
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Engineered living materials (ELMs) are composed, either entirely or partly, of living cells. ELMs entirely composed of living cells are called biological ELMs and they self-assemble via a bottom-up process – e.g. synthetic morphogenesis for organoids’ production. ELMs only partly composed of living cells are called hybrid living materials (HLMs) and are built with a top-down process with integrated polymers or scaffolds. In both cases, the cellular components extract energy from the environment to form or assemble the material itself, and to adapt its morphology and function to environmental stimuli. This endows these materials with a combination of properties not present in any non-living material: self-regeneration, adaptation to environmental clues, longevity and environmental sustainability. By being alive, ELMs represent a fundamental change in materials’ production and performance, enabling new, better or similar functionalities, compared to traditional materials but with decreased costs and environmental impact. ELMs have the potential to transform virtually every modern endeavour from healthcare to infrastructures to transportation.
With this Pathfinder ELMs Challenge the EIC seeks to seize the opportunity to position strategically Europe at the forefront of the ELMs field, which is still in its infancy. This Pathfinder Challenge aims to overcome the technological challenges to harness the engineering potential of nature for materials’ production. The specific objectives of this call are to support the development of new technologies and platforms enabling the controlled production of made-on-demand living materials with multiple predictable dynamic functionalities, shapes and scales; and to build a community of researchers and innovators in ELMs. Reaching these objectives requires a research team that strongly integrates, among others and not exclusively, expertise in synthetic biology, materials engineering, control engineering, artificial intelligence, synthetic or engineered morphogenesis as well as ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA).
Projects under this call are expected to develop technologies for the production of a minimum of two different living materials (i.e. with different applications, scale - 10 x difference- and cellular composition). The specific expected outcomes depending on the choice of the ELM production process (top-down or bottom-up) are:
a proof of principle of technologies far beyond the current state-of-the-art enabling the production of a minimum of two novel biological ELMs bigger than 1 cm in all dimensions by programmable and controlled synthetic or engineered morphogenesis (whether with eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells);
or
a laboratory validated, automated and computer-aided design-build-test-learn (DBTL) platform far beyond the current state-of-the-art able to produce a minimum of two novel HLMs in multiple scales with enhanced or unprecedented properties.
Projects are strongly encouraged to consider multi-cellular ELMs. They are also encouraged to develop technologies that can be easily generalizable and adapted for the production of a broad range of ELMs from different cells.
Projects funded under this call are also expected to collaborate and contribute to the wider ethical, societal and regulatory debate.
Specific conditions for this challenge
In order to apply, your proposal must plan to validate the technologies by producing at least two different living materials (i.e. with different applications, scale - 10 x difference- and cellular composition). These must not be a derivative of each other. The material needs to be formed by living cells as per the definition of ELMs in the introduction of this call. Alternatively if a synthetic cell is used, the synthetic cell must have, prior to the start of the project, a demonstrated ability (via a peer-reviewed scientific publication) of cellular reproduction via cell division and adaptation to environmental clues.
Your proposal also needs to define an integrative approach to assess the needs and implications of the technologies and their limits, including ethical and regulatory requirements.

You should apply to this call if you are looking for support from EIC Pathfinder Open to realise an ambitious vision for radically new technology, with potential to create new markets and/or to address global challenges. EIC Pathfinder Open supports early stage development of such future technologies (e.g. various activities at low Technology Readiness Levels 1-4), based on high-risk/high-gain science-towards-technology breakthrough research (including ‘deep-tech’). This research must provide the foundations of the technology you are envisioning.
EIC Pathfinder Open may support your work, especially if it is highly risky: you may set out to try things that will not work; you may be faced with questions that nobody knows the answer to yet; you may realise that there are many aspects of the problem that you do not master. On the contrary, if the path you want to follow is incremental by nature or known, EIC Pathfinder Open will not support you.
Before applying you should verify that your proposal meets all the following essential characteristics (‘Gatekeepers’):
Convincing long-term vision of a radically new technology that has the potential to have a transformative positive effect to our economy and society.

To achieve the general objectives of the Programme[2], the proposed research should aim at developing knowledge, tools and guidelines supporting safe operation of existing nuclear power plants and research reactors, including long-term operation and management of fuel with increased nuclear fuel burnup and enrichment, and allowing for knowledge-based decisions by operators and regulators. Advanced safety systems for existing Generation II and III nuclear plants could also be included in research proposals, especially with new build.
Research could include safe and trusted AI-enabled core monitoring/diagnostics, integrity assessments of systems, structures and components, in-service inspection and qualification, definition of updated integrity requirements, load quantification, evaluation of ageing and reliability of components of different systems. It could also address different types of materials such as metals, non-metallic, concrete, composites or polymers, ceramic and fuels, using suitable tools and models, digital transition, long-term operation and other innovations e.g. Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF).
Activities could include the development and use of models and codes for probabilistic safety assessments (PSA) and deterministic safety assessments (DSA) of plant safety-related transients, use of advanced integrated safety methodologies (including better simulation methods and consideration of ageing effects), assessment of operational margins and upgraded reactor safety systems (increased diversification and robustness), criticality studies as well as seismic, flooding and fire propagation modelling. Use of PSA techniques in periodic safety review (PSR) of nuclear power plants, for prioritisation of the improvement actions for each one of the 16 safety factors, as provided in IAEA specific safety guide for periodic safety review for nuclear power plants (SSG-25)[3].
Specific attention could be paid to solutions taking into account external hazards linked to most recent climate projections. Another important aspect is integration of human factor (cultural, behavioural and organisational aspects) and safety culture-related issues in safety assessment.
Proposed research could also address challenges for mitigating severe accidents, which are related to in-vessel and ex-vessel corium/debris coolability and interactions, containment behaviour including hydrogen explosion risks, evaluation of the source term for any potential radioactive releases, potential impact on the environment and evaluation of scenarios should a severe accident occur, emergency preparedness and response, development and use of computational techniques based on big data and artificial intelligence to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.
The Commission would also invite consortia to propose innovative solutions and research approaches other than those listed above in order to deliver the expected outcomes.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular to avoid any duplication of the work conducted in other fora.
Where appropriate, the Commission recommends that consortia make use of the services of the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The JRC may participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. The JRC would bear the operational costs for its staff and research infrastructure. The JRC facilities and expertise are listed in General Annex H of this Work Programme.

Delivery of assessments and tools facilitating the safe, secure and efficient integration of nuclear energy systems into low-carbon and smart energy systems.
Assessment of social considerations regarding safety of advanced and innovative technologies.
Scope:
Proposed research should support the safety assessment and development of advanced and innovative reactor safety designs and technologies for deployment in the medium and long term, including Research Reactors and the Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). Proposed research should develop design with intrinsic safety features, integrated in a competitive plant design also improving non-proliferation and safeguards, reducing waste generation and improving safety, energy security and improved economics.
R&D should support advanced and innovative concepts to improve long-term operation by design, safety by design, possibly with a high level of passive safety systems, safe and trusted AI-enabled core monitoring/diagnostics, innovative manufacturing of components, components including joining or welding or welding-less techniques, fuels and reactivity control, reducing the need for maintenance and enhancing the economics. In addition, advanced primary and secondary cooling systems could be further developed to minimise waste generation and environmental impacts and ensure that future designs are resilient to abnormal conditions, events like natural hazards, including through more flexibility and higher reliability during and immediately after these external extreme events such as flooding, storms, droughts etc.
Digital modelling of NPPs could be developed for all stages of reactor development and deployment, including design, operation and maintenance. Research could enable the development of multi-scale and multi-physics numerical models for the major structures, systems and components e.g. reactor cores or steam generators, both in terms of instantaneous behaviour and (long-term) ageing, including fuel assemblies.
If the design is at an advanced stage, research on human and organisational factors influencing plant safety and operation could also be included in the proposal, as well as safe integration of digital technologies and safe and optimal plant management.
R&D under this action could have spinoff benefits also for the safety of existing Generation II and III plants, especially with new build. Proposals could also consider cost benefit analysis, optimisation of the safe use of large advanced innovative reactors and SMRs in transition to low carbon and smart energy systems.
Research could assess the flexibility of margins for the safe operation of nuclear reactors to adapt to expected demand, the safe integration of nuclear generation with energy storage options, low-carbon energy carriers, the development of technologies to optimise the safe integration of nuclear plants into future low-carbon and smart grids (including multiple criteria and cost benefit analyses).
Research could also investigate how European citizens perceive the risks, benefits and potentials of advanced and innovative technologies, and the opportunities for their participation in the development of advanced and innovative technologies. The action could support open and participatory approaches to research and innovation in the field of advanced and innovative technologies.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Development of strategies for multi-recycling of LWR spent nuclear fuel, closing the MOX fuel cycle, and reducing radiotoxicity of the radioactive waste originating from the LWR nuclear fuel.
Investigation of recyclability of other elements than uranium and plutonium, as well as innovative fuel types.
Scope:
Today, Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel, manufactured from plutonium and depleted uranium, provides about 5% of the new nuclear fuel used in world, with an even higher proportion in Europe. Spent MOX fuel is several times more radioactive than spent uranium oxide fuel. An alternative approach for multi-recycling of LWR nuclear fuel and closing the MOX fuel cycle would decrease radiotoxicity and the volume of the radioactive waste resulting from spent MOX fuel and improve security of supply.
Management and recycling of spent MOX LWR fuel should be addressed in a coherent analysis of the fuel cycle covering all the LWR and the new spent fuel streams, and in particular by addressing the different potential alternative technologies for the recycling of those fuels, including advanced reactor systems.
Proposed research should advance state-of-the art design and manufacturing of fuel cycles based on spent MOX fuel valorisation, focusing on the development of a strategy for treatment of minor actinides and other non-fissile elements obtained in the fuel re-processing. In the spirit of a circular economy, a strategy of extracting elements with limited supply (e.g. metals of the Platinum Metal Group) has to be investigated in the proposal. The efficiency and selectivity of the processes, and the purity of the recovered elements, will be the crucial criteria for the selection and test of new processes.

Exploration of the potential of advanced nuclear materials solutions (also from new manufacturing technologies covered by actions funded by Horizon Europe) for use in other energy technologies that require exposure to high temperatures, high pressure and corrosive fluids.
Scope:
This action[1] will contribute to the development and qualification of advanced nuclear structural materials, such as austenitic, ferritic and martensitic steels, nickel based alloys, SiCf/SiC composites and other ceramic materials, refractory alloys and other prospective materials e.g. high-entropy alloys (HEA). The research should also address complex material science approaches (e.g. surface treatment methods).
The proposal should cover aspects of qualification methodology under extreme conditions and test standardisation towards elaboration of relevant codes and design rules. Advanced modelling of properties, microstructure and behaviour of structural materials, especially in view of their optimisation and characterisation of the respective phenomena (e.g. microstructural or microchemical evolution, coolant compatibility models, etc.), including non-destructive material examination for health monitoring purposes, have to be an integral part of the proposal.
Research work should also move beyond state-of-the-art understanding of the ageing processes of materials in nuclear installations e.g. concerning creep, fatigue and thermal ageing or environmental compatibility between coolant (water, gas, heavy liquid metals (HLM) and molten salts) and structural materials, the effect of irradiation on the structural materials, including fuel cladding should be considered. Experimental activities could benefit from the implementation of the ‘European Facility in Nuclear Research’ (topic HORIZON-EURATOM-2021-NRT-01-12).
It is expected that crosscutting material issues relevant to both fission and fusion technologies[2] will be addressed in the proposal. Proposals should clearly describe the cross-cutting scope and resources to be allocated.

Confirmation, with an early involvement of regulators, if a generic design for HTR can be proposed for licensing and how a licensing process can be launched at the European level.
Demonstration of the feasibility of coupled nuclear cogeneration technologies and installations at industrial scale.
Socio-economic evaluation of introducing cogeneration with temperatures relevant to HTR in the industrial landscape of European regions with high energy-consuming industries.
Scope:
Complementing the achievement of Horizon Europe’s objectives, inter alia in the context of the energy transition, requires the significant reduction of emissions and decarbonisation of high energy-consuming industries while ensuring the supply of affordable, reliable and low-carbon energy. For some Member States, nuclear cogeneration technologies could offer potential solutions in this area by directly providing heat and/or hydrogen for different applications.
Today, High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) designs, using proven technology, would be able to deliver process steam close to 600°C.
The proposed research should validate the safety features of High Temperature Reactors (HTR) for cogeneration initiatives for high energy-consuming industries, provide know-how for standardisation, design tools for different temperature ranges, design the coupling between the power generating plant and associated processing plants, and analyse transients and buffering technologies, and licensing requirements. An updated evaluation of all fuel cycle aspects (front and back ends) with HTR should be provided for the reference design and the innovative concepts.
The proposed action should investigate if a generic design, fulfilling requirements of safety directive, can be proposed for licensing, and how the licensing process can be launched at European level.
The proposed research should capitalise on progress made through current cogeneration research initiatives in the EU, group together relevant stakeholders and establish the necessary technical, regulatory and financial conditions for launching this proposal.

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes:
Preliminary safety assessments of innovative fission and fusion reactors, aiming at investigating worst hypothetical accident sequences for each specific technology, as well as, wherever appropriate, their related “source terms” to allow a comparison of all fission and fusion technologies’ safety levels.
Provision of a scientific basis and knowledge for an effective harmonisation and standardisation of reactor components assessments, methodologies, codes or standards, for the establishment of transparent and enhanced predictable licensing processes, including new manufacturing technologies, e.g. hot isostatic pressing, additive manufacturing or innovative surface treatments / coatings, meeting the needs and requirements of European nuclear safety regulators, based on pre-normative research and capitalising on progress made by existing research and cooperation initiatives, especially with a view to achieving safe long-term operation by design.
Investigate the possibility of transferring to the nuclear sector, if applicable and relevant, licensing procedures developed successfully in other industrial sectors for which European and international standardisation frameworks are established.
Investigate the possibility to consider safe reuse and recycling requirements in the licensing procedures and standards.
Consolidation of European research capacities for implementing a performance-based regulatory approach, focussing on desired and measurable outcomes.
Data and results disseminated and reported to Member States’ nuclear safety regulators in order to facilitate their early involvement regarding safety verifications and licensing of future fission and fusion installations.
Scope:
The development of innovative technologies and licensing for new installations could be particularly time-consuming and costly if regulators are not involved and if citizens’ concerns are not considered at an early stage, adding delays to deployment. The timely involvement of standardisation and design code bodies is equally important, by involving at an early stage the regulators for improving the exchange between researchers, technical safety organisations and regulators. The evolution of the safety regulatory framework fostering an early involvement of independent regulators in the innovation process could accelerate deployment of new technologies, while ensuring the highest safety standards. This change is possible through cooperation between safety regulators, technical safety organisations, research organisations, industry and supply chain actors on qualification, standardisation, verification and validation and licensing. In this framework, The European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) could, as appropriate, be consulted. Additionally, the action should support the development of methodologies that consider stakeholder involvement, and take due account of the specific social and economic contexts where technologies are developed and operated.
Nuclear regulatory regimes, by evolving from a prescriptive-based approach to a performance-based approach, could ensure compliance with safety objectives for all innovative fission and fusion designs and technologies. Inclusion of fusion, still in the early development stage, is possible thanks to safety demonstrations being carried out for ITER and that are expected to cover all accident scenarios. In addition, top-level safety objectives for ITER are based on international guidelines similar to those adopted by nuclear fission facilities.
In addition to regulatory issues, the approval of innovative designs faces a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, regulatory bodies need a relatively detailed design to start safety assessment and give an early feedback to operators, knowing that the standardisation of component requirements is not sufficient to assess the overall safety of the installation. On the other hand, operators need to optimise their resources on design before having the regulatory bodies’ opinion on their safety options. The action should also support R&D to facilitate the elaboration of a more detailed design, at a lower cost. The use of ‘numerical twins’ of the installation, including the modelling of accident scenarios, is a promising opportunity.
This action[1] should support the development of performance-based licensing methodologies for innovative nuclear fission and also specific methodologies for fusion designs to take into account their distinctive properties, based on their related “source terms” to allow a comparison among safety levels. It should facilitate the establishment of a common understanding on licensing methodologies for advanced technologies between nuclear safety regulators, contributing to harmonisation of licensing methods of future installations. It should also lead to a more transparent and predictable licensing process and more effective regulatory oversight. Additionally, the action should support the development of methodologies that consider stakeholder involvement and take due account of the specific social and economic contexts where technologies are developed and operated.
Pre-normative research and methodologies for new designs and operating conditions, with emphasis on high temperature and high-irradiation dose by establishing shared codes and standards according to a strategy to progressively enlarge consensus among stakeholders, should be covered. This also includes a digitalisation of nuclear installations, optimisation of supply chains, streamlining design approval and harmonising classification schemes.
The proposed actions should capitalise on progress made by current relevant research and cooperation initiatives in standardisation and nuclear safety, in Euratom and outside, especially considering the conclusions of the EU stress tests. Involvement of regulatory bodies and technical safety organisations should be encouraged and participation of relevant stakeholders from all Member States would be a major advantage. Proposals should demonstrate that research will be carried out in cooperation with and meeting requirements of EU Member States nuclear safety regulators. In this respect, the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), as appropriate, should be consulted, to provide guidance on topics relevant to regulatory opinions. As research programmes and safety expertise topics support regulatory opinions, it is also appropriate to consult the Technical Safety Organisations’ association (ETSON). Cross-cutting fission-fusion research activities that ensure synergy of research efforts in solving common challenges are encouraged. Research actions for the harmonisation of licensing procedures, codes and standards focused only on future fission or fusion plants could be acceptable, if duly justified.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is encouraged.
Where appropriate, the Commission recommends that consortia make use of the services of the JRC. The JRC may participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal.

Assess the advantages and disadvantages for harmonised application of internationally agreed regulatory measures.

Evaluate the regulatory implications of using advanced manufacturing technologies in waste management and decommissioning, including robotics, automated site mapping, additive manufacturing and digital twin technology.
Scope:
The objective of this action is to address benefits and advantages of providing solutions for obstacles to a common regulatory framework in waste management and decommissioning, providing a basis for improving harmonisation. This will support implementation of the requirements of a high level of nuclear safety and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste
The action should reinforce the activities of the European Joint Programme EURAD, PREDIS but also the SHARE project (StakeHolder-based Analysis of REsearch for Decommissioning, which will provide, by the end of 2021, a Strategic Research Agenda and an inclusive roadmap), including development and knowledge and competence transfer across Member States' national programmes. One of the lessons learned in decommissioning and waste management is that the efficiency of a technological development depends not only on the techniques used or an operator's ability but also on regulatory aspects, and other societal dimensions.
Application of international safety standards (e.g. IAEA) and EU directives (EC/Euratom) can vary from one country to another, as they are adapted to local considerations and national policies. Euratom directives set out minimum requirements that can be exceeded by the Member States. Different approaches create obstacles for collaboration at EU level on developing common waste treatment processes, conditioning and facilities. For example, differences in clearance levels could affect a full development of a circular economy in decommissioning and waste management.
Alignment and harmonisation based on EU standards would be advantageous, enabling an efficient comparison of the efficiency, the suitability as well as the limits of available techniques being used in similar conditions. In addition, a common regulatory basis will help to qualify the economic operators in the decommissioning sector on the common basis of an internationally shared assessment. This is important because the decommissioning market has an increasing international dimension.
Proposed actions should establish or clarify the possible benefit and value added of more aligned and harmonised rules and standards, as well as shared processing facilities between Member States. The starting point of this action would be from an R&D, safety, environmental, social, economic and efficiency point of view, and would also consider the necessary legal (incl. nuclear liability) aspects. All actors concerned, such as waste producers, technology developers, research entities, waste management agencies and regulators should contribute to:
Establish an inventory of common waste and of radioactive materials that are potentially recyclable and could be simply reused, not only in present-day and future nuclear fuel cycles but also in non-power nuclear applications and outside the nuclear industry.
Establish an inventory of available treatment processes (including bioprocesses) and facilities for treating radioactive materials and waste, including facilities under development.
Based on the identification of Member States’ regulatory differences regarding clearance and waste acceptance criteria, identify opportunities would enhance common sharing of experiences to building citizen’s trust and to develop a common market. The programme should identify the reasons underlying such discrepancies in national regulations and evaluate the risks associated with harmonization, for example a degradation of local acceptance. The implementation of subsidiarity should be assessed.
Define the safety, economic, environmental and social impacts, benefits of aligned and harmonised regulations harmonised to existing international directives and propose methodologies for aligning regulations
Identify opportunities for the development of joint European waste management facilities between several waste producers and for possible commercial agreements for treating radioactive materials and waste.
In addition, benefits from the work of ENSREG should be capitalised towards further harmonisation of national regulations in line with European and International directives and recommendations, and best practices, considering that Member states are free to have more protective regulations than agreed at international level.
Proposals should help aligning harmonised application of regulations but should also complement EURAD in the assessment of the feasibility of geological disposal facilities for irradiated fuel and centralized storage facilities for irradiated fuel, by assessing if they can be safely built and operated in Europe. Attention should also be given to the potential advantages of fostering a harmonized interpretation, among the various actors (implementers, regulators, science providers…) of what is considered to be sufficient and appropriate, from a scientific, societal and technical point of view, to establish and review a safety case as support to a license application for a geological disposal facility.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is encouraged.
Where appropriate, the Commission recommends that consortia make use of the services of the JRC. The JRC may participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. The JRC would bear the operational costs for its own staff and research infrastructure operational costs. The JRC facilities and expertise are listed in General Annex H of this Work Programme."

The Partnership is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Establishing improved risk estimates for the justification of practices and optimisation of radiological protection of the members of the public, patients, workers and environment in all exposure situations (medical, natural, occupational, accidental, including co-exposure and overlapping risks), in order to support the implementation of the Basic Safety Standards Directive.
Advancing state-of-the-art understanding of the link between exposure characteristics (radiation quality, dose and dose-rate) and the cancer and non-cancer effects, including optimised detection and dosimetry.
Developing a knowledge base and analytical tools for the major features of variability in the radiation response, including radio-sensitivity (tissue reactions), radio-susceptibility (cancers) and radio-degeneration (aging), radio-induced immunoresponse, in humans and ecosystems.
Advancing integrative radiobiology from basic mechanisms to clinic and epidemiology, including human and social sciences to further characterize and evaluate ionising radiation effects.
Providing a scientific basis and establishment of priorities for medical applications of ionising radiation, taking a broad approach to the public health impact, in view of addressing knowledge gaps relevant for decision-making, reinforcing the risk/benefit analysis, advancing individual patient dosimetry, developing recommendations, procedures and tools for improving radiation protection of patients, and supporting effective transfer of new and optimised medical procedures into clinical practice.
Providing a scientific basis to recommendations, procedures and tools for improving radiation protection of workers and of the general public in line with the Basic Safety Standards Directive.
Providing a scientific basis to recommendations, procedures and tools for assuring and improving preparedness for nuclear and radiological emergency response and recovery, including the improved knowledge about which values need to be accounted for in stakeholder involvement, as well as direct radiological population monitoring and their indirect monitoring through environment sampling and measurement, also based on computational techniques that make use of big data and artificial intelligence
Reinforcing training through research in the field radiation protection and encouraging continuous training and career upgrades
Facilitating access to research infrastructure and promoting the integration of data, FAIRisation processes (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
Improving public engagement, the understanding of public perception on radiation risks, identification of different target groups among stakeholders, and the public communication and participation on radiation risks and protection measures, to favour public acceptance of these measures.
Scope:
The Commission invites proposals for establishment of the European Partnership for research in radiation protection and detection of ionising radiation. Proposed Partnerships should fulfil requirements set out in this topic as well as meet criteria for the selection and implementation of European Partnerships, their monitoring, evaluation, phase-out or renewal as set in Horizon Europe Regulation[1].
Radiation protection research funded under this Partnership should provide solutions and recommendations for protecting people and the environment from the potentially harmful effects of ionising radiation, as required by the Basic Safety Standards Directive. A reinforced multidisciplinary approach to research, innovation and citizen involvement is needed to further develop the knowledge base and enable implementation of innovation regarding risks from different exposures to radiation, enabling the implementation of that knowledge into direct gains in Radiation Protection culture and practice. The influence of individual’s characteristics, such as sex and age, and the interaction with other risk factors will have to be addressed as part of research on individual sensitivity, susceptibility and degenerative fragility. This is of a major concern in medical application, which are to be justified and optimised, based on sound evidence and scientific outcomes.
Implementation of this Partnership would require a cooperation of the entire European research community concerned in order to exploit synergies between different scientific disciplines. This implies the possible involvement of all research institutions and universities, from fundamental and applied research to human and social sciences. The Partnership would need to take account of present state of knowledge and priorities identified in the Strategic Research Agenda of MELODI (low dose radiation), ALLIANCE (radioecology), EURADOS (dosimetry), NERIS (nuclear emergency preparedness) and EURAMED (medical exposures), SHARE (social sciences and humanities) and SNETP (sustainable nuclear energy technology platform).
Furthermore, citizens should continue to be involved by supporting open and participatory approaches to research and innovation in the field of radiation protection. Good decisions call for consideration of societal issues and of citizen involvement in the options and assessment of risks associated with radiation exposure.
In order to deliver expected outcomes, the Partnership would build on and further develop the research priorities identified by the European Joint Programme for the integration of radiation protection research (EJP CONCERT) in the Joint Roadmap. The Partnership would also need to take into account the Euratom Scientific and Technical Committee’s opinion on the research roadmap, the SAMIRA initiative[2] and the outcomes of other relevant, forward-looking analyses like the EURAMED research roadmap for medical applications, and of societal priorities, individual dosimetry and artificial intelligence deciding the exposure optimisation and of societal priorities
The Partnership will address the identified research and innovation priorities topics through the launching of several open calls. Call priorities will be identified in close connection with stakeholders. Governance structure within the Partnership should ensure independent open calls issuing, project proposal evaluation and selection.
Links with other partnerships and international cooperation beyond Euratom, particularly with international organisations is encouraged. Other synergies across programmes such as Horizon Europe Health cluster and the proposed mission cancer will continue to be explored, through dedicated working groups. Collaboration with industry for technological developments and bringing scientific and technological breakthroughs a step closer to the market for the benefit of citizens and society is also recommended.
The Partnership will ensure the availability of and facilitate access to state of-the-art research infrastructures required to implement the research roadmap. This will be done coherently with action 12 (European Facility in Nuclear Research).
Finally, the Partnership will develop competences in radiological protection with a special focus on radiological protection culture. Solutions should be proposed for addressing the challenge of communicating results in radiological protection to, and engaging with, non-specialist audiences such as policy decision-makers and the wider public.
Financial commitments and in-kind contributions are expected to be provided by the partners of the consortium for the governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts for national coordination.
Proposals could pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
The Commission also invites consortia to propose innovative solutions and research approaches other than those listed above in order to deliver the expected outcomes.
Where appropriate, the Commission recommends that consortia make use of the services of the JRC. The JRC may participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. The JRC would bear the operational costs for its own staff and research infrastructure operational costs. The JRC facilities and expertise are listed in General Annex H of this Work Programme.

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes:
Demonstration of concepts and applications of nuclear and radiation technologies going beyond their traditional areas of implementation and exploring their market potential
Demonstration of application of innovative technologies available from non-nuclear sectors for improving nuclear safety and safe applications of ionising radiation
Demonstration of an added value to cross-sectoral products, standards and/or services in which ionising-radiation technologies are embedded.
Scope:
‘Innovation beyond technology’ refers to a technology expertise, know-how or facilities developed for one sector (e.g. aerospace, aviation, telecoms or the automotive or nuclear industries) which can be used in a totally different area. It opens the way for transferring new or disruptive technologies to spin-offs, industry and the marketplace, to transform Europe’s capability for innovation in specific areas and to help capture and drive future economic growth.
Nuclear and radiation technologies are present in a wide variety of applications in industry, research, health, food and agriculture, environment, security, space and cultural heritage. Ionising radiation (IR) is used in many domains like sterilisation, manufacturing, non-destructive testing and detection and environmental applications. Objectives of Horizon Europe should be reflected in this action.
IR can modify the physical, chemical and biological properties of materials on an industrial scale. The industrial use of isotopes and radiation is of great importance for the development and improvement of processes, measuring, automation and quality control. Besides, the applications of nuclear technology could extend beyond our planet: European space exploration will be extremely difficult without radio-thermal generators and dynamic isotope power systems. Deep-space probes are impossible without radioisotopes and safety in the use of radio-sources for space exploration has to be considered.
Further development of IR applications is essential for the benefit of EU citizens and a competitive industry in Europe if combined with newly emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, big data or metamaterials or industrial processes for production of low‑carbon energy carriers, thereby creating new markets and jobs opportunities in Europe. This action is expected to stimulate innovation and promote a robust, world-leading nuclear technologies sector based on EU safety culture and know-how.
Exploiting the innovation potential in European and international industrial and academic communities will only be achieved by being a focal point where small and medium enterprises, large industry and end-users can work together with researchers to understand societal needs and the challenges of societal acceptability, address barriers, explore and develop new ideas and bring these to commercial reality.
This action should aim at ‘open innovation’ involving a broad spectrum of actors from research and academic communities, industry, entrepreneurs and users. It should bring together multidisciplinary teams to generate ideas and solutions in an open innovation environment by increasing investment and bringing more companies and regions into the knowledge economy.
Proposed research activities should contribute, to the extent it is relevant, to meeting EU's commitments in, for example, energy, digital, climate, health.
This action could focus on closer-to-the-market activities including prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting and scaling-up for new or improved products, processes or services. Proposals may include limited research and development activities and clearly demonstrate European added value. Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 (indicative, but not mandatory, depending on the innovative potential field of application).
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is encouraged.
Where appropriate, the Commission recommends that consortia make use of the services of the JRC. The JRC may participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. The JRC would bear the operational costs for its own staff and research infrastructure operational costs. The JRC facilities and expertise are listed in General Annex H of this Work Programme."

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Access for researchers and research teams from Euratom and Associated Countries to European and international state-of-the-art nuclear research infrastructures;
Development of a network for an optimised use of existing nuclear research infrastructures identified in Europe supporting the implementation of the Euratom Programme’s objectives and the establishment of the European Research Area in the nuclear field;
Substantial increase of trans border collaboration in nuclear research in Europe;
Securing availability of key experimental facilities e.g. materials testing research reactors in operation, hot cells and laboratories, mechanical and Thermal Hydraulic tests facilities, light water reactor sustainability, fuel cycle research and development, advanced modelling and simulation, and advanced reactor technology programmes, or innovative solutions and research approaches;
To complement, wherever applicable and beneficial, on-going Euratom projects (including EURAD European Joint Programme) and European Partnership for research in radiation protection and detection of ionising radiation (Topic HORIZON-EURATOM-2021-NRT-01-09) providing access and use of to the most advanced research infrastructures, (large-)scaled resources and expertise.
Scope:
Ensuring access to the European and international research infrastructures is key to making scientific progress in nuclear field and is one of the foundational blocks of the European Research Area. Community support will be provided to cover costs of transnational access for researchers or research teams from Member States and Associated States to European and international state-of-the-art nuclear research infrastructures in other countries.
Users are provided access (at no cost to the researcher) to world-class nuclear research facilities, technical expertise from experienced scientists and engineers, and assistance with experiment design, assembly, safety analysis and examination.
The objective is to promote and enhance access to infrastructures that provide essential and unique services to the European research community and are typically beyond the reach of individual laboratories, in order to advance research in all areas (except for fusion research undertaken by European Partnership in fusion research) covered in Annex I of the Council Regulation establishing Euratom Programme.
The Commission encourages international cooperation with third countries and international organisations within the scope of this action, also to avoid any duplication with the coming FIDES initiative from the OECD/NEA but investigating their complementarities. Support for researchers from European stakeholders (including academia, research centres and industrial laboratories), third countries and international organisations is envisaged, where such access is part of the promotion of international cooperation with the countries or international organisations concerned and if researchers from Euratom Member States have equivalent access to their infrastructures.
Based on the lessons learnt from former and current user facility projects, a framework and a set of common rules will be established for the future sustainable operation of a network of ‘Euratom user facilities’. A strong support for mobility of learner’s and/or link with the proposal from topic HORIZON-EURATOM-2021-NRT-01-13 could be an advantage.
The active participation of major infrastructure operators will be required to achieve these objectives. The support scheme should operate by open calls and offer access, technical expertise from experienced scientists and engineers and assistance with experiment design, assembly, safety analysis and examination.
Proposals could pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties in order to implement activities of this action.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Development of innovative routes of production of therapeutic and diagnostic radionuclides in EU, looking into reactor-based and alternative methods, including accelerator-based as well as separation / purification methods, also taking into account waste management options (EURAD), nuclear security and proliferation concerns.
Development of optimised irradiation targets, that are interchangeable to allow use within the whole EU supply network, and prioritising production with raw and source materials which are available and sustainable for the EU.
Development of recommendations for implementing clinical trials involving radiopharmaceuticals in the EU, including the development of individual/specific organ dosimetry for the therapeutic applications (in target and non-target tissues).
Ensuring an adequate supply of radioisotopes for further research, clinical trials and clinical use with full implementation of radiation protection measures and with reduction of costs along the whole supply chain.
Scope:
Therapeutic nuclear medicine is developing rapidly in oncology. Theranostics – the combination of diagnostics and therapy – is an emerging application of medical isotopes that exploits different properties of radioisotopes. Targeted radionuclide therapy, including alpha and beta therapy, is a promising approach for the treatment of cancer. Several alpha- and beta-emitting isotopes have demonstrated effectiveness in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Theranostic compounds are likely to make a difference to cancer patients in the near future not only through improvements in their quality of life but also in terms of survival rate. Appropriate availability of alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides must be ensured to treat patients and enable investigation of feasibility of targeted radionuclide therapies.
The proposed research action should cover development of reactor-based and alternative, including accelerator-based, production of therapeutic and diagnostic radionuclides in order to address the lack of consistent supply, a major barrier for further research, clinical trials and clinical use. The action will cover development and optimisation of suitable targets for the different production modalities including target fabrication techniques for established and novel target nuclides (e.g. Ra-223, Lu-177, Ac-225, Re-188, Pb-212, At-211, etc. and related diagnostic radionuclides), possible raw and source materials and their availability, novel target solutions, radiochemistry for target dissolution, separation and quality assured purification of desired radionuclides.
Ensuring the safety of the new treatment options using radionuclides for all those involved (patients, medical staff, and public) is also a crucial area requiring further development. Research should cover activities such as: advanced means of generator-type delivery of the radionuclide and improvement of the application of Good Manufacturing Practices at the point of care, particularly if using “in-house labelling”; optimisation of treatment planning and individual/organ dosimetry; development of recommendations for clinical applications including sensitive groups (e.g. children) or rare diseases; review of ethical considerations; consultation of stakeholder groups.
Proposed actions should be complementary to the co-funded European Partnership for research in radiation protection under Topic HORIZON-EURATOM-2021-NRT-01-09 of this Work Programme, and with the other relevant programmes such as the Horizon Europe Health cluster, the SAMIRA action plan and the EU Beating Cancer Plan.
The Commission also invites consortia to propose innovative solutions and research approaches other than those listed above in order to deliver the expected outcomes.
An action could be carried out by a consortium of organisations such as research infrastructures, pharmaceutical industry, medical universities and hospitals.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is encouraged; however the action should be focused on developing radionuclide therapy capacities and resilience for Euratom Member States.
Where appropriate, the Commission recommends that consortia make use of the services of the JRC. The JRC may participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. The JRC would bear the operational costs for its own staff and research infrastructure operational costs. The JRC facilities and expertise are listed in the General Annex H of this Work Programme."

This topic aims at supporting activities that enable the conduct of vaccine & therapeutic trials to boost prevention and further inform public health policy and clinical management. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to two of the three expected outcomes listed below:
Enrichment of the current portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 /COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics with clinical testing of promising candidates.
Further development of new, or adjustment of existing, vaccine candidates to be effective against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially protect against new emerging ones.
Development of new effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 for the clinical management of COVID-19 disease, including for the prevention of disease progression to severe illness and hospitalisation.
Scope:
Proposals submitted under this expression of interest should aim to further develop promising therapeutic or prophylactic candidates against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. The vaccine/treatment candidates should have completed preclinical development, including animal studies, and be ready to enter clinical evaluation in Phase I or II studies. Applicants should have addressed the current viral variants of concern in their pre-clinical work, and/or anticipated the emergence of new variants. Proposals should include a summary of results obtained in the concluded studies (pre-clinical and/or Phase I). Proposals are also expected to include assurances on sufficient and timely access to GMP production of the compound(s) to be trialled (the costs of which can be included in the proposal). In addition, options to upscale production for subsequent development beyond the activities for which funding is requested, should be indicated as appropriate.
The proposed interventions should address, and be assessed for, different age population groups, including children and pregnant women, and target specific groups of interest such as immunocompromised, patients with co-morbidities or other groups with higher risk to develop severe disease, and patients suffering from long-term health consequences of COVID-19.
The therapeutic interventions to be developed should aim at treating mild to moderate illness (e.g. antivirals, antibodies, immunomodulators). Therapeutic interventions targeting severe to critical illness resulting from the infection are excluded.
Thermostability, innovative delivery systems, affordability and the flexibility of the platforms to speedily adjust the candidates to emerging variants, should be also considered when possible.
Successful applicants are expected to engage early on with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to ensure adequacy of the actions from a regulatory point of view.
Collaboration with one of the large European trial networks VACCELERATE, RECOVER or EU-RESPONSE projects is expected and applicants are encouraged to describe their plans for such collaboration in the proposal[1].
Proposals should envisage an appropriate level of collaboration with existing European research infrastructures, and should link to the COVID-19 data portal[2] for the timely sharing of relevant data.
Gender-related issues are an important crosscutting priority of this Expression of Interest. All data should be sex- and gender-disaggregated, and attention should be paid to critical social factors intersecting with sex/gender, such as age, social origin, ethnicity/migration, and disability.
This action seeks to address the challenges linked to the COVID-19 variants. As such, the granting authority has activated the public emergency provisions included in the General Annexes, meaning that beneficiaries must comply with the public emergency related provisions listed in the General Annexes of the Work Programme 2021 (part G - Legal and financial set-up of the grant agreements) and in the Model Grant Agreement concerning the project implementation under Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), background and results, access rights and rights of use (article 16 and Annex 5) for the duration of the pandemic; and under Communication, dissemination, open science and visibility (article 17 and Annex 5) during the entire duration of the action and for four years after the end of the action.
It is expected that quality-controlled data are shared in accordance with the FAIR[3] principles. The use of harmonised protocols in collaboration with other actors is recommended for this purpose.
The Commission expects to select at least one proposal on a vaccine and one on a therapeutic candidate for funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 10 million would allow these specific challenges to be addressed appropriately, with phase I trials expected to be at the lower end of this spectrum. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Please note that expenditures can be covered from the date of submission of the proposal, but at the applicant’s own risk.
Proposals can be concise and should focus on the essential information to facilitate an appropriate evaluation.
[1]Applicants should not contact these projects before they submit the proposal as this would lead to work overload for the applicants as well as the mentioned projects. Applicants should indicate in their proposal which networks/projects would be relevant for their proposed work. If their application is successful, the Commission will facilitate the connection between the coordinator/project and the relevant network/project(s) at the time the grant preparation will start

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to the development of large scale, COVID-19 cohorts and networks worldwide, including beyond Europe’s borders, forging links with European initiatives as a global response to the pandemic. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim at delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
In the short-term, contribution to a better understanding of the global circulation of the current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and their characteristics, delivering recommendations on the best strategies to control viral spread, as well as on optimized clinical management and treatment of COVID-19 patients.
In the short-term, contribution to the evaluation of the impact of the variants of concern on the different vaccines and vaccination strategies and information on best vaccine and treatment options.
In the short/medium/long-term, monitoring the emergence of new variants of concern, elucidating the impact of different variants on transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 disease, including long-term post-infection sequelae (long COVID).
In the long term, establishment of regional and internationally linked strategic cohorts that can be pivoted rapidly to research on emerging infectious diseases.
In the long-term, contribution to regional and international pandemic preparedness networks to rapidly address pandemics in the future on a global scale.
Scope:
Proposals submitted under this expression of interest are expected to build on existing large-scale, multi-centre, regional or international cohorts worldwide and/or establish new ones linked to those. These cohorts should aim to rapidly advance the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants of concern, with the aim of developing evidence-based strategic and robust recommendations for the effective control and prevention of COVID-19 infection. The regional or international cohort(s) should allow to rapidly and consistently provide estimations on the occurrence and spread of emerging variants of concern in different parts of the world. They should contribute to a better understanding of their transmissibility, virulence and pathogenicity.
Risk and protective factors to infection, and clinical manifestation including long-term post-infection sequelae (long COVID) should be investigated for different variants and different (risk) groups (e.g. children, elderly) to potentially identify biomarkers for vulnerable populations and inform treatment options.
The cohort(s) should also contribute to elucidating the effectiveness of the various first-generation vaccines and the risk of reinfection in previously infected individuals in the different cohort populations, including risk groups, to inform on optimal vaccine strategies. The effectiveness of second-generation or adjusted vaccines should be considered as soon as they become available.
Clinical studies, carried out within the cohort(s), might also help to inform best treatment options and vaccine strategies.
The cohort(s) should cover different regions of the world to capture the various variants and vaccine and treatment strategies.
To allow for harmonised, high-quality data collection, standardisation of clinical protocols facilitated data sharing and coordination across existing cohorts, a strong collaboration with the EU-funded projects ORCHESTRA and RECODID, as well as the EU COVID-19 data portal[1] is expected. Applicants should describe their plans for such collaborations in the proposal[2].
Applicant consortia are expected to collaborate with other relevant initiatives already existing or under development at national, regional, and international level, in order to maximise synergy and complementarity and avoid duplication of the research efforts. Coordination across cohorts and established clinical trial networks on COVID-19 treatment and vaccines is encouraged to improve research outcomes.
Strong collaboration with regional public health and regulatory authorities is strongly encouraged.
Proposals should include a plan on maintaining the established cohort(s) to strengthen regional or international research preparedness for a future epidemic or pandemic.
If more than one proposal is successful, proposals should collaborate and this should be foreseen in the proposal.
Gender-related issues are an important crosscutting priority of this Expression of Interest. All data should be sex- and gender-disaggregated, and attention should be paid to critical social factors intersecting with sex/gender, such as age, social origin, ethnicity/migration, and disability.
This action seeks to address the challenges linked to the COVID-19 variants. As such, the granting authority has activated the public emergency provisions included in the General Annexes, meaning that beneficiaries must comply with the public emergency related provisions listed in the General Annexes of the Work Programme 2021 (part G - Legal and financial set-up of the grant agreements) and in the Model Grant Agreement concerning the project implementation under Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), background and results, access rights and rights of use (article 16 and Annex 5) for the duration of the pandemic; and under Communication, dissemination, open science and visibility (article 17 and Annex 5) during the entire duration of the action and for four years after the end of the action.
It is expected that quality-controlled data are shared in accordance with the FAIR[3] principles. The use of harmonised protocols in collaboration with other actors is recommended for this purpose.
For the selection of proposals for funding, the Commission will take the geographical distribution of activities into account.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 10 million would allow these specific challenges to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Please note that expenditures can be covered from the date of submission of the proposal, but at the applicant’s own risk.
Proposals can be concise and should focus on the essential information to facilitate an appropriate evaluation.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to all of the expected impacts of destination 1 “Staying healthy in a rapidly changing society”, as well as the expected impacts of all other destinations of the health cluster. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon Europe calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe.
The network of National Focal Points (NFPs)[1] supporting the implementation of the EU Health programmes and the Enterprise Europe Network (EENs)[2] providing support for small and medium-sized enterprises will be closely collaborating with the network of National Contact Points (NCPs) for the Health Cluster based on identified complementarities and synergies.
Scope:
Proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants.
The network will organise NCP Information Days, NCP trainings, brokerage events for potential participants and provide appropriate tools and instruments to support NCPs and researchers. Activities will support researchers of the social sciences and humanities to connect into all Clusters of Horizon Europe. To achieve its expected outcomes and objectives, the NCP network could cooperate with but should not duplicate actions foreseen in other thematic and horizontal Horizon Europe NCP networks.
Proposals should include a work package to implement matchmaking activities to link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of the Health Cluster. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. Where relevant, synergies should be sought with the Enterprise Europe Network to organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles.
The proposed structure and activities of the HE Health NCP network, should be closely interlinked with and associated to (at national and regional level) with those of the National Focal Points (NFPs) supporting the EU Health programmes. It is important to facilitate cooperation, identify and use synergies between the work of these two NCP and NFP networks - but also with other NCPs/NFPs responsible for different EU programmes providing funding available for health-related actions. This cooperation would not only improve the quality of the relevant actions funded by Horizon Europe and EU4Health but also the overall EU-level public health impact of all health-related actions using any EU funding.
Special attention should be given to enhancing the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how built up in other countries.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
The proposal should cover the whole duration of Horizon Europe plus one year.

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 “Unlocking the full potential of new tools, technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes.
Medical device developers provide sustainable and affordable smart active implants validated in the operational environment.
Medical professionals in resource-constrained clinical settings use sustainable and affordable surgical procedures for smart active implants.
Patients have access to sustainable and affordable smart medical devices suitable for minimally invasive surgical implantation through further clinical studies.
Scope:
“Smart” technologies, i.e. micro-electronic sensor/actuator systems provide novel functionalities to surgically-implanted active medical devices. “Smart” active implants involve microelectronic components and are placed inside the body of the patient to achieve the desired physiological response. They open up therapeutic avenues for a wide range of medical handicaps, complex chronic conditions and lesions, thanks to their integrated diagnostic capabilities, and may help addressing hitherto unmet medical needs. Challenges involved in the development of these devices include but are not limited to miniaturization, sensor robustness, wireless power supply, etc. Such devices require specific surgical implantation procedures, dependant on the type of device and on the intended use, with the successful surgical implantation and activation of such smart medical implants, being crucial steps for their functioning. The device targeted and its intended use is open for applicants to choose (e.g. orthopaedic, neural, cardiovascular, metabolic, etc.), but should at the start of the proposed work be at a TRL of minimum four and will necessitate appropriate tailored surgical procedures and interventions. Surgical conditions account for approximately 30% of the global burden of disease and have a huge social and economic impact. However, of the 300 million surgical interventions undertaken globally every year only around 6% occur in low-income countries, where a third of the world’s population lives. There is therefore a strong need for high-quality, affordable surgical interventions for implanting “smart” active medical devices suitable for resource-limited or -constrained clinical settings. Resource-constrained settings are clinical environments that are affected by limitations such as lack of medical staff, scarcity of medical equipment or medicines supply, etc. To address this gap, the sustainability of both the medical device and the applied surgical intervention, including the necessary equipment and operating skills, are essential elements. Implantation procedures should be fully compatible with resource-constrained environments and minimally invasive approaches should be favoured. Hence, research and innovation activities should comprise medical device design, regulatory work, clinical stages and developmental iterations, reaching a TRL of at least seven, and involve key medical specialists (e.g. surgeons) and/or other health care professionals, developers, patients and relevant regulatory bodies as appropriate. The work proposed should take into account the new EU legal framework on medical devices with the targeted implants meeting all the essential requirements as defined therein.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Competent authorities, researchers and developers use assays for the valorisation and/or assessment of efficiency, delivery, safety, potency or mode of action of novel advanced therapeutic interventions based on either pluripotent stem cells, genome editing or RNA, that are aligned with regulatory standards.
Clinicians, researchers and developers test several new advanced therapies based on pluripotent stem cells, gene editing or RNA ready through clinical trials meeting the regulatory requirements.
Scope:
The recent development of advanced therapies has been hampered by the lack of robust research on certain key parameters e.g. safety, upscaling, immunity, potency assays, cost-effectiveness, and early on in development. This topic aims to ensure that the next wave of advanced therapies, based on either pluripotent stem cells, gene editing or RNA, are established in a timely fashion and in accordance with the appropriate regulatory standards for further clinical testing. It will support preclinical research platforms for disorders with high prevalence and burden[1] that tackle the bottlenecks currently encountered in the field, ensuring that promising advanced therapies can reach the market within the next decade. Applicants should justify the disease or disorder to be targeted with its prevalence level, the related burden and unmet needs. Applicants could propose activities in one or several of the following areas, and should take into consideration the Oviedo Convention, eligible actions and ethical principles as defined by the Horizon Europe Framework Programme [2]:
Method development for the production and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells[3] (defined as cells that can give rise to cells from all three embryonic germ layers), to include defining appropriate potency assays. Complementary activities to assess mode of action, safety, in vivo validation or upscaling procedures could be considered.
Development and validation of biological assays and methods that can demonstrate efficacy, delivery, specificity, and safety (including off-target effects) of genome editing products in targeted cells and tissues (e.g. base editing, prime editing, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, zinc-finger nucleases, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Complementary activities to assess in vivo validation or upscaling procedures could be considered.
Development and validation of novel RNA-based therapeutics targeting non-communicable diseases. Complementary activities to assess mode of action, delivery, safety, in vivo validation and/or upscaling procedures could be considered.
Study, analysis and tackling of different immune responses, taking into account factors like sex and age, generated by any of the above-mentioned advanced therapies in vivo, facilitating regulatory approval for next phase of research and development.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
comprehensive catalogue of research infrastructure services relevant to tackle infectious diseases epidemics is available, including services supporting pertinent social sciences research;
fast assembly and provision of innovative, customised and efficient research infrastructure services to support research linked to detecting, assessing and combatting newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants;
challenge driven integration of research infrastructures to better support research addressing infectious diseases and face epidemics, including for use by epidemics risk assessment and risk management bodies (such as the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) and national epidemics management bodies);
rapid response to epidemics outbreaks through research infrastructure services underpinning and supporting research aiming to understand causes and development of the epidemic;
development of novel/adapted epidemics intervention tools and measures enabled by relevant research infrastructure (RI) services;
availability of research data emerging from access provision activities for re-use on common data platforms and registries, according to FAIR principles and compliant with legal provisions under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Scope:
Proposals under this action, will integrate research infrastructure services to form a comprehensive and inclusive portfolio to support research in response to infectious disease epidemics or underpinning respective forefront research in the field. As a first immediate challenge, the delivered services should support research targeting newly emerging SARS-Cov-2 variants and addressing the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.
Proposals will support the provision of trans-national and/or virtual access to researchers as well as training for using the infrastructures, and activities to improve, customise and integrate the services the infrastructures provide, so as to facilitate and integrate the access procedures and to further develop the remote or virtual provision of services.
Access to research infrastructure services will be provided to users to support their research projects targeting the development of new or adapted prevention and/or intervention tools and measures, such as new or adapted diagnostic procedures and therapies, drugs, vaccines, clinical disease management or disease vector control, or evidence-based public health, socio-behavioural and socio-economic measures. Priority should be given to supporting research projects targeting newly emerging virus variants, focusing on their detection, characterisation, surveillance and assessment (changes in transmissibility and disease manifestation) and on the adaptation of intervention and prevention measures (medication, vaccines, public health measures) which likely also requires additional regulatory and clinical trials support.
Following the One-Health concept, services supporting research on transmission of pathogens from animals to humans (or vice versa animals as host reservoir), including vector-borne transmission, should be covered. Research infrastructures dealing with social science should be involved to enable data acquisition enhancing understanding of individual and population perceptions and behaviours in an epidemic setting, including public response to intervention measures such as social distancing, vaccine campaigns, etc., over the course of an epidemic. Flexibility in the provision of services should be properly demonstrated to ensure fast re-orientation and expansion of the portfolio in response to unexpected epidemics situations, including emerging threats posed by new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Effective operational links to epidemics risk assessment and management bodies like ECDC, WHO, OIE, a possible future EU Health Emergency preparedness and Response Authority (EU-HERA) and national authorities are essential. Global standards, relevant data platforms and registries should be used to make user project results openly available and usable, thus enabling further research on pathogens, disease manifestation, behavioural research and other epidemics related social science research.
Appropriate links should be ensured with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the European COVID-19 Data Platform and the newly established Population Health Information Research Infrastructure for COVID-19 (PHIRI). Data management (and related ethics issues) and interoperability should be addressed.
To identify and better exploit related synergies, share results and avoid overlaps, grants awarded under this action should cooperate with those awarded under the Other action “FAIR and open data sharing in support of European preparedness for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases”. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.
Pandemics are global challenges and collaboration with relevant international partners should be envisaged.
Proposals should adhere to the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures[1].
Proposals should make available to researchers the widest and most comprehensive portfolio of research infrastructures services which are relevant for the scope. To this extent, they should involve, as beneficiaries or as third parties, the necessary interdisciplinary set of research infrastructures of European interest[2] that provide such services. The inclusiveness of the proposal will be taken into account in the Excellence score.
Research infrastructures from third countries[3] may be involved when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services, including data, than those available in Europe.
Proposals could consider, for their inclusion in the service portfolio, relevant services and expertise offered by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) , and in particular by its Nanobiotechnology laboratories[4], on high-end characterisation of therapeutics against pandemics, including antibodies, viral antigens, vaccine nanocarriers, and, more in general, on characterisation of nanomaterials, nanomedicines and advanced materials.
Grants awarded under this action are expected to duly contribute to any future Partnership for Pandemic Preparedness that might be established under Horizon Europe.
Proposals should include an outreach plan to actively advertise its services to targeted research communities and, if applicable, to relevant industries, including SMEs.
Proposals are expected to exploit synergies and to ensure complementarity and coherence with other EU grants supporting access provision.
Proposals will include the list of services/installations[5] opened by research infrastructures for trans-national or virtual access and the amounts of units of access made available for users.
Further conditions and requirements relating to access provisions that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in the “Specific features for Research Infrastructures” section of this Work Programme. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to several of the following impacts
enhancement of EU capacity to identify, characterise and mitigate the effects of COVID-19 virus variants of concern, and future emerging pathogens of public health concern;
reinforced research infrastructures capacity to provide at scale and across the EU services to support excellent research to address societal challenges, and Horizon Europe objectives;
enhanced and increased society’s long-term and consistent problem-solving capacity and evidence-based policy making in areas linked to health, including a better understanding of socio-economic implications, through the provision of innovative, customised and efficient RI services;
new discoveries and knowledge breakthroughs enabled by access provision to the best and in some cases unique state-of-the-art RIs;

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
European researchers and public health actors fighting the spread of infectious diseases, e.g. COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases are able to store, share, access, analyse, process and cite research and clinical data and other research digital objects across disciplines and national borders and to collaborate with global partners;
federation of viral and human infectious disease data from national and international centres enables pan-European and global sharing and combination of research and clinical data, thereby catalysing and accelerating research advances to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future outbreaks;
development of digital tools and data analytics for pandemic and outbreak preparedness, including tracking genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2, linking genomic and clinical data to support timely identification of variants of concern, and subsequent rapid characterisation of such strains to inform public health action;
linking of FAIR data and metadata on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, on other related viruses and diseases, and on socio-economic consequences, across research fields, from omics, clinical, and epidemiological research, to Social Sciences and Humanities accelerate infectious disease research, surveillance and outbreak investigation;
contribute to the Horizon Europe European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Partnership and to the development of the European Health Data Space (EHDS).
Scope:
This action responds to the need to enable researchers, health care professionals and society at large to share, access, analyse, link and process research data and other research digital objects across disciplines and national borders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As seen with other infectious disease outbreaks, such as haemorrhagic fevers, COVID-19 will likely remain a societal challenge beyond the immediate outbreak, considering its destructive and disruptive impact on healthcare systems and the economy. In addition to the ongoing health threat from SARS-CoV-2, the risk from other emerging pathogens also persists, which will also require similar concerted action to identify and characterise infections with pandemic potential, and enable rapid public health action to mitigate health and societal impact. Provision of comprehensive open data on infectious agents and diseases during outbreaks support evidence-based quality assessment - across scientific, medical, public health and policy domains and promotes reproducibility of research outcomes. Particular importance should be placed on mobilising raw viral sequences and identifying and monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. European readiness for future pandemics is of utmost importance and should be addressed to ensure the preparedness of infrastructure building on already existing frameworks for broader use such as the EOSC.
Proposals should facilitate and accelerate the access to, and the linking of data and metadata on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, including through the European COVID-19 Data Portal[1], the Versatile Emerging infectious disease Observatory[2] (VEO) and other relevant initiatives, with the emphasis on identifying and tracking of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and creating appropriate links with serology and other host data. The scope of the initiative should further expand to other relevant infectious diseases, and incorporate epidemiological, clinical (including Real World Data), and socio-economic data, spanning from molecular biology to other disciplines, including Social Sciences and Humanities. A One-Health approach building on the latest technological advances, covering epidemics and epizootics is encouraged. Particular importance should be given to the need of federating data between national centres to effectively manage data protection.
To ensure the interoperability of the data, community best practices including the use of community-endorsed standards and community metadata schemas should be encouraged. Newly implemented domain specific research data solutions from the project should feed into the work of established international initiatives. Particular attention should be given to the harmonisation and management of meta-data and sample- identifiers to ensure interoperability of national and regional efforts into the EOSC and the long-term cataloguing of data resources within the EOSC.
A strong focus should be placed on exploiting and contributing to EOSC capabilities for data access and federation as well as relevant standards and policies for managing, sharing and reusing research data from different disciplines. As such, the proposals should demonstrate the value of sharing FAIR research data that is as open as possible through EOSC, help consolidating data-sharing and data management practices across the Member States, Associated Countries and beyond, and provide feedback to the EOSC Partnership for the future evolution of EOSC.
Proposals should build on the European COVID-19 Data Platform[1] and support, directly or in combination with financial support to third parties, the creation of national and regional structures to coordinate and promote in-country actions, such as to further enhance genomic surveillance and rapid-response capabilities.
Cooperation with the grant awarded under the Other action “Research infrastructure services for rapid research responses to COVID-19 and other infectious disease epidemics” should be developed from the outset to identify and better exploit related synergies, share results, avoid overlaps and ensure that data generated from access to infectious disease services can be available for re-use through the EOSC. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources. Proposals should consider already established national and European infrastructures and build on existing efforts, including actions stemming from Cohesion policy programmes. Proposals should seek to establish synergies with the European Health Data Space as well as relevant initiatives under Digital Europe.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, alignment with EOSC policies, and a synergetic development of different thematic areas within EOSC, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC, particularly in the areas of data interoperability.
All software developed under this action should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative.
This action seeks to address the challenges linked to the COVID-19 variants. As such, the granting authority hereby requests activation of the public emergency provisions, meaning that the beneficiaries must comply with the public emergency related provisions listed in the General Annexes concerning the project implementation under - Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), background and results, access rights and rights of use (article 16 and Annex 5) for the duration of the pandemic; and under Communication, dissemination, open science and visibility (article 17 and Annex 5) during the entire duration of the action and for four years after the end of the action.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to one or several of the following impacts:
transforming the way researchers as well as relevant actors in the public and private sectors create, share and exploit research outputs (data, publications, protocols, methodologies, software, code, etc.) within and across research disciplines, and with the public health sector, leading to improved timeliness, better quality, more innovation, higher productivity of research and a better integration between research outputs and public health policy;
seamless access to and management of increasing volumes of research data following FAIR principles (and that are as open as possible, as closed as necessary) and other research outputs stimulating the development and uptake of a wide range of new innovative and value-added services from public and commercial providers;
improving trust in science through increased FAIRness, openness and quality of scientific research in Europe, supported by more meaningful monitoring and better facilitators for reproducibility, validation and re-use of research results, and by improving pathways for the communication of science to the public.

Photonics is driving innovation in many different application areas. The challenge is to help European companies become more competitive by improving their business/production processes as well as products and services by means of photonics technology. The aim is to accelerate the design, development and uptake of photonics technology, by a wide range of industrial players, in particular SMEs by providing low-barrier access to volume production of advanced photonics components available to a wide range of industrial players, in particular SMEs which would otherwise not have easy access. Photonics Manufacturing Pilot Lines should form the basis for future Photonics Digital Innovation Hubs.
Scope:
The focus is on Manufacturing Pilot Lines: actions should provide open access to manufacturing of advanced photonics components and systems and offer related services including design and characterization. They should cover all stages of manufacturing through to testing, provide a low entry barrier access to low and medium production volumes and the processes used should be scalable to high production volumes. Actions should include a validation of the pilot line offer with involvement of externals users in pre-commercial production runs. Activities should aim at long-term sustainability, including development of or integration into photonics innovation hubs.
Actions should make use of existing infrastructure and develop close links with on-going European and national initiatives in order to maximise impact. Proposals must present industrially relevant business cases for the manufacturing pilot line, a plan for long-term sustainability and a credible strategy for future high volume production in Europe at competitive cost.
Actions must address one or more of the following technologies.
Indium Phosphide (2018 call): providing open access to photonics integrated circuits based on Indium Phosphide, going beyond multi-project wafers and offering generic solutions for a wide class of applications.
Silicon Photonics (2018 call): providing open access to photonics integrated circuits based on Silicon Photonics, going beyond multi-project wafers and offering generic solutions for a wide class of applications.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: A key structural change overtaking computing is the move towards a low-power computing continuum spanning embedded systems, mobile devices, desktops, data centres, etc. The demand for low-power multi/many-core computing systems is intensifying across all market segments.
Capitalising on Europe's industrial and technology strengths in low power computing and embedded and cyber-physical systems, the objective is to strengthen European competitiveness in the key parts of the emerging computing value chain. With the wider diffusion of embedded ICT and cyber-physical systems, security becomes increasingly important to be addressed across all levels starting from secure and trusted zones supported on hardware and software level.
Scope:
a.      Research & Innovation  Actions should cover one or both of the following themes:
         Next generation servers, micro-server and highly parallel embedded computing systems based on ultra-low power architectures: The target is highly performing low-power low-cost micro-servers, using cutting-edge technologies like, for example, optical interconnects, 3D integrated system on chip, innovative power management,  which can be deployed across the full spectrum of home, embedded, and business applications. Focus is on integration of hardware and software components into fully working prototypes and including validation under real-life workloads from various application areas. Specific emphasis is given on low-power, low-cost, high-density, secure, reliable, scalable small form-factor datacentres (""datacentre-in-a-box""). Proposals requesting a Large contribution are expected.
         New cross-layer programming approaches empowering developers to effectively master and exploit the full potential of the next generations of computing systems based on heterogeneous parallel architectures and constituting the computing continuum. Beyond performance, optimisation should include energy efficiency, time-criticality, dependability, data movement, security and cost-effectiveness. Research should also aim at radically increasing the productivity in programming and maintaining intrinsically parallel code by marginalising the need for dual expertise - application engineering and computer system engineering. Focus is on holistic approaches hiding the complexity between the computing HW component level and the level of application families. Proposals requesting a small contribution are expected.
b.      Innovation Actions: Activities aim at stimulating broad adoption of customised low power computing technologies. They should cover one or both of the following themes:
         Towards platforms and ecosystems: Establish reference architectures and platforms for customised low-power heterogeneous computing systems delivering high-performance functionality under real-time constraints across several sectors and application domains. Activities should be use-case driven and include industrial consensus building, pre-normative activities, reference implementations, proof-of concept demonstration and validation in key application domains. The users' perspective will be paid due attention. Proposals requesting a small contribution are expected.
         Connecting innovators across value chains: Driven by the requirements of users, application experiments must bring together all actors along the value chain to customise and use advanced low power computing systems in cyber-physical systems. With special emphasis on SMEs and mid-caps, experiments are expected to be clustered in large scale projects driven by networks of European centres of excellence to achieve critical mass and to better exploit EU-added value.
Proposals requesting a Large contribution are expected. The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers running the experiments for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 150.000[1] per party).  Maximum 50% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to this purpose.
c.       Support Actions for cross-sectorial platform-building, for clustering of related research projects, for structuring the European academic and industrial research communities, for dissemination of programme achievements and impact analysis and for constituency building and road-mapping for future research and innovation agendas.
Expected impact:
         Reinforce and broaden Europe's strong position in low-power computing in traditional and new market segments by strengthening the technology competences of European suppliers and the academic community.
         Reduction of energy consumption of servers by 2 orders of magnitude as compared to state of the art in 2013.
         Double the productivity in efficiently programming and maintaining advanced computing systems powering cyber-physical systems as compared to state of the art in programming embedded systems in 2013.
         Increase the adoption of form-factor data-centres and heterogeneous highly parallel computing systems.
         Higher involvement of SMEs, both on the supply and the demand-side.
         Increased adoption of concurrency in applications across all sectors; higher degree of parallelism in applications; increased public trust in embedded applications due to secure and reliable architectures.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
""Smart anything everywhere"" stands for the next wave of products that integrate digital technology inside. A major challenge is to accelerate the design, development and uptake of advanced digital technologies by European industry, especially among them many SMEs and mid-caps in products that include innovative electronic components, software and systems[1].
Scope:
a. Innovation Actions should address all of the following three aspects.
Establishing across Europe networks of multidisciplinary competence centres offering one-stop shops/marketplaces for companies that want to experiment with digital technologies inside their products. Centres should act as ""innovation hubs"" offering facilities (access to technology platforms) and services for developing innovative products, such as design, manufacturing, rapid prototyping and life-cycle management. They should also act as brokers between suppliers and users of technology products and solutions. Competence centres are encouraged to link to existing and emerging regional (smart specialisation) or national innovation hubs. If Horizon 2020 funding is complemented by ESIF or other regional or national funds, Horizon 2020 funding should be used for carrying out highly innovative experiments that will multiply the impact of local initiatives to a European scale, and will build partnerships between businesses in Europe.
Carrying out a critical mass of cross-border experiments bringing together different key actors along the full value chain to customise the technologies according to the requirements of the users. Driven by the requirements of first-time users, Application Experiments bring together the actors of the value chain and the experts necessary to enable new users to develop novel products or services and assist them in customising and applying these in their respective environments. Alternatively competence centers could provide access to design and prototyping and small value production or a combination of the above. Experiment descriptions in proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation plan and business scenario. To remain flexible on which experiments will be carried out and to stay flexible in fast moving markets, the action may involve financial support to third parties, in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. The proposal will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers running the experiments for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 20 000 – 100 000[2] per party). Maximum 50% of the EU funding can be allocated to financial support to third parties.
Activities to achieve long-term sustainability of one-stop shop / market place services by the competence centres and the eco-system. This includes the development of a business plan for the competence centres and the marketplace, of which an outline business scenario should be described in the proposal. In addition, investors should be attracted to support business development of SMEs and mid-cap actors in successful experiments. Such activities would include also dissemination and support to exploitation. Among others, communication and dissemination activities shall make use of established networks reaching out to SMEs like the Enterprise Europe Network and the NCP network.
Innovation actions are expected to focus on one or more of the following four areas of technologies. Selected projects are expected to collaborate on building the European ""Smart Anything Everywhere"" ecosystem:
Area 1: Cyber-physical and embedded systems: The goal is to help businesses from any sector uplift the quality and performance of their products and services with innovative embedded ICT components and systems and to support eco-system building for promising platforms developed in earlier R&I products.
Area 2: Customised low energy computing powering CPS and the IoT: The goal is to help businesses who are developing products for situations where high computing capacity and low energy would be a competitive advantage and to support eco-system building for promising platforms developed in earlier low power computing projects.
Area 3: Advanced micro-electronics components and Smart System Integration: The goal is to support electronic components, sensors, smart objects and systems (i) access[3] to advanced design and manufacturing for academia, research institutes and SMEs, and (ii) rapid prototyping targeting SMEs.
Area 4: Organic and large area electronics: The goal is to help businesses in further maturing, innovating and validating their products with organic and large area electronics technologies. Focus is on i) access to design, technology and prototyping which are mature and ready to use, and ii) application experiments driven by concrete user requirements and business cases.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to 7 million would allow areas (1), (2) and (3) to be addressed appropriately. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to 4.5 million would allow area (4) to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one innovation action is supported for each area of technologies.
b. Coordination and Support actions
The aim is to reinforce the collaboration between the actions supported under this initiative, to increase the outreach of these actions and their impact and to achieve a wider coverage of stakeholders in technological, application, innovation, and geographic terms. Tasks and services should include maintaining a single innovation portal for newcomers; sharing of best practices and experiences; dissemination; identifying new innovative ICT technologies that can benefit from this scheme, brokering between users and suppliers; leveraging further investment by creating linkages with regional/national initiatives and by stimulating organic growth.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to 1 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address all of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success when appropriate.
Innovation in products, processes and business models leading to quantifiable increases in market shares and/or productivity of European companies and/or industrial capacities in Europe, notably for SMEs and mid-caps operating in non tech sectors.
Business growth and increase competitiveness of digital technology suppliers, in particular SMEs, able to supply components and systems that may be integrated in various products.
Creation of a self-sustainable ecosystem of innovation hubs including ICT suppliers and users supported by services available through a one stop shop, covering a large number of regions and their smart specialisation.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Network traffic is expected to keep on showing two-digits annual growth rates in all network segments over the coming years and beyond. The limits of existing technological approaches for both optical and wireless technologies are about to be reached. As far as access networks are concerned, the cost of current solutions also represents a barrier to reaching a (quasi-) universal coverage with ultra-high speed, be it with optical or wireless access. New challenges imposed by major trends in the usage of communications networks are to be taken into account as well as the high projected increase of mobile and ubiquitous broadband access which requires further developments in backhaul networks, for which optical and wireless technologies constitute key enablers.
In the specific wireless domain, spectrum is a scarce public resource whose usage is often strategic for the economy and society, which must be optimised in view of the expected exponential traffic and usages growth as outlined in the Commission Communication on ""Promoting the shared use of radio spectrum resources in the internal market"". Finally, communication networks represented about 22% of the ICT carbon footprint in 2011. This is expected to grow fast to almost double in 2020 if underlying network technologies are not significantly improved.
Scope:
a.      Research & Innovation actions: proposals are expected to cover one or both of the themes identified below, but not necessarily both of them.
         Focus on optical networks - The target is to address i) the lack of dynamic control and management of optical network resources within and across operator's domains for lower cost and more flexible use of resources; ii) the ubiquitous delivery of very high speed access at 10 Gbps per user within 10 years and 100 Gbps later (including visible light communication); iii) the architectural limitations of inter and intra datacenter connectivity; iv) the limitations of current optical transmission technologies. Attention must be given to ensuring compatibility with legacy infrastructures and access unbundling regulation as well as to cost- and energy-efficiency.
         Focus on wireless networks - It addresses the lack of dynamic control of wireless network resources through disruptive new ""femtocell"" like paradigms where end-users play the role of “prosumers” of wireless connectivity. Optimised spectrum use; energy efficiency and new usages are targeted. More flexible use of spectrum may be addressed from an architectural perspective including cognitive radio and spectrum aggregation, usage of higher bands up to 90 GHz, advanced modulation and coding, adaptive beam forming techniques. Hybrid combination of terrestrial and satellite infrastructures to address complete coverage, optimised spectrum use and network resilience are also in scope.
b.      Support actions
Production of technological roadmaps, support dissemination (including the yearly domain conference) and standardisation in the wireless/optical domains, support the integration of results coming from the various projects to provide an overall programme view, support liaison with related international activities, support the elaboration of research, operational and economic metrics in the target domains, and explore demonstrations and validation strategies for the objective.
Expected impact:
Research & Innovation actions
         Maintain a state of the art industrial capability on optical network technology in Europe with at least 20% of the global market share.
         Diversify the strong European capabilities in wireless systems through emergence of novel technologies and spectrum usage patterns.
         Support the cost efficient emergence of novel classes of network services and applications by avoiding the ""capacity crunch"".
         Reduce energy consumption of basic infrastructures by a factor of about 10.
         Decrease spectral radiation exposure through low EMF technologies.
         Move beyond 10 Gbps per user within 10 years and 100 Gbps per user in a farther future over fixed accesses.
         Support metro and core networks with Pb/s throughput and Tb/s interface speeds.
         Enable managed and automated cross domain optical resources and foster emergence of industry open standards.
         Reach higher spectrum efficiency, target 10 fold increase.
         Enable new applications through spectrum efficient use of higher frequency bands little used today.
         Achieve ubiquitous access to critical/societal applications.

Photonic technologies for health applications is a very promising field, where the EU has produced significant results during the past decades; however, industrialization is still lagging behind. The challenges are to develop methods that provide the clinicians with photonics enabled tools to improve or to assess the successes of therapies and to transform low TRL technologies into robust medical devices answering to clinician needs.
Photonic circuits are typically employed in combination with high performance electronics, micro-optics while the thermal management and the efficient integration of these technologies is accordingly of major importance. The challenge is to create and develop advanced techniques for intimate integration of sub-systems incorporating multiple technologies enabling application across multiple domains.
The European continuous process industries as well as the piecewise manufacturing sector are facing the continuous struggle to keep a leading role in the worldwide competition. The challenge is to deploy photonic sensor technologies for the exact monitoring of process and product parameters so as to optimize those processes, saving resources whilst guaranteeing optimum product quality.
Scope:
The focus is on the following themes:
Innovation Actions
Photonics devices to support monitoring therapeutic progress: Actions should develop reliable (high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy), safe to operate, cost-effective and fast photonics enabled devices to support assessing the effects of treatments of major diseases like cancer (excluding skin cancer), infectious, degenerative and cardiovascular diseases, including determining individual dispositions (eg methods to assess drug resistance) and monitoring of therapy progress. The feasibility and validity of the proposed approach should already have been validated in clinical settings. A medical equipment manufacturer should drive the action, and physicians/clinicians/surgeons must be closely involved. Validation should take gender specificities into account. Small scale clinical studies should be included, but clinical trials are excluded.
Sensor-Based Optimization of Production Processes: Sensor-Based Optimization of Production Processes: Actions should address prototyping, demonstration, optimization and validation in real industry settings of highly advanced smart broadband multimodal photonic sensing solutions operating in the spectral range from the ultraviolet to the far infrared, and intended for improving production process through the monitoring of relevant process and product parameters (e.g. physical, chemical, imaging, geometrical and environmental). The focus is on cost-effective process-integrated solutions that are optimized in terms of speed, quality, and resource efficiency. The solutions should also address embedded pre-processing and suitably interpreting the acquired raw data for the optimization of the processes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Research and Innovation Actions
Photonics System on Chip/ System in Package for optical interconnect applications: Actions should address advanced techniques for the intimate combination of photonic integrated circuit technology with other enabling circuits, devices and mother boards to realise major advances in the capability, performance and complexity of photonic system-on-chip and system-in-package components targeting photonic interconnect applications in the network, datacentre and consumer communication space. A holistic approach from design through to test is required. The targeted component technologies need to have demonstrable performance advantages in terms of speed, energy efficiency, cost and reliability and fit in the system and network architecture roadmaps of vendors.
Photonics systems for advanced imaging to support diagnostics driven therapy: Actions should research ground-breaking, reliable (high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy), safe to operate, cost-effective and fast photonics enabled imaging system to support diagnostics during intervention and treatments of major diseases like cancer (excluding skin cancer), infectious, degenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Physicians/clinicians/surgeons and a medical equipment manufacturer must be closely involved from requirement specifications to validation in clinical settings. Validation should take gender specificities into account. Clinical trials are excluded.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Coordination and Support Actions
Fostering careers in photonics: Actions should reach out to STEM graduates/PhD students and young postdocs in order to encourage more of them to pursue a career in photonics. Actions should help make students more industry ready and should provide the appropriate training, encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. Gender issues must also be addressed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 1.5 million (for theme i) would allow this to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Recent trends in cloud computing go towards the development of new paradigms (heterogeneous, federated, distributed clouds) as opposed to the current centralised model, with tight interactions between the computing and networking infrastructures. The challenge is to address, from the research and experimentation perspectives, the necessary evolution in cloud architectures, cloud networking, deployment practices and run-time management as well as the associated security and privacy needs. The ambition is to increase the uptake of cloud technology by providing the robustness, trustworthiness, and performance required for applications currently considered too critical to be deployed on existing clouds. From the innovation side, the challenge is in fostering the provision and adoption of competitive, innovative, secure and reliable cloud computing services by SMEs and public sector organisations across Europe. Mastering these trends in cloud computing will contribute towards a connected Digital Single Market[1].

New paradigms: proposals may cover one or more of the themes identified below, but not necessarily all of them.
Deployment and management of densely interconnected and decentralised cloud infrastructures, including the extension of the fog computing paradigm to the extreme edge of the network;
Cloud networking in the context of software-defined data centres as well as re-allocation of resources and services (independently of their location) across distributed computing and geographically separated data storage infrastructures;
Techniques to deal with trust, security and privacy in decentralised cloud infrastructures and across multiple cloud providers, including aspects of data integrity, data localisation and data confidentiality;
Evolution of cloud architectures to improve the management of physical resources and the efficiency of cloud systems, including the concomitant evolution of databases and cloud computing architectures, to address new challenges on scale, resilience and security posed by data-intensive applications deployed over highly distributed and federated environments.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow these areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Innovation Actions
Proposals should cover one of the themes identified below:
Experimentation of cloud-based services and their deployment configurations in large-scale decentralised and federated environments, in particular exploring and contributing towards interoperability and standardisation. Experiments are intended to support the automated deployment of complex applications across multiple clouds and data centres, to investigate the performance of cloud infrastructures and to characterise Quality of Service and Quality of Experience under a wide range of load and fault conditions. The approach should explore aspects of interoperability, scalability, performance, robustness, security and efficiency of the mechanisms, like those put forward by FIRE[2].
Cloud Computing for SMEs and Public Sector Innovation: the focus is on fostering innovation through an increased provision and adoption of cloud computing services by two strategic target communities: SMEs and public sector organisations. The focus is on piloting and demonstration in near-operational settings that could lead to the introduction and uptake of new, flexible and resource-effective cloud solutions for SMEs and/or the public sector. The proposed work is intended to leverage these innovative solutions to overcome current challenges such as data portability and interoperability, data protection and access control, standardisation, etc.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increase Europe's technological capacity and competitiveness through the development of advanced cloud solutions. Proposals should provide appropriate metrics for the claimed impacts.
Increased and predictable performance of cloud offerings, facilitating deployment of critical applications and services.
Increased trust in clouds through stronger security and data protection practices, including open and auditable solutions for data security. Increased control by users of their data and trust relations.
Experimentation across a variety of settings that enhance Quality of Experience and contribute to standardisation and interoperability. Integration with other international initiatives for large-scale global experimentation.
Increased readiness for adoption of trustworthy cloud-based solutions for SMEs and public sector organisations, spanning from generic enabling services to specific applications.
Demonstration, through appropriate use cases, of the potential to improve the competitive position of the European cloud sector and to facilitate the emergence of innovative business.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Information and Communication Technologies are becoming a core component of products in all market sectors. The trend towards “Smart Anything Everywhere” must be supported by innovations allowing a very significant reduction of two complementary aspects: the cost and complexity of software development for modern architectures, and the energy footprint of computation and communication.
Software development is one key challenge, because current programming tools do not fully support emerging system architectures. Massively parallel and heterogeneous systems are difficult to program and to optimise dynamically for the multiple conflicting criteria imposed by the application domain like performance, energy efficiency, dependability, real-time response, resiliency, fault tolerance and certifiability.
The targeted markets are cyber-physical systems, industrial and professional applications, Internet of Things, connected smart objects and all the application areas where very low energy consumption is essential and where non-functional requirements like guaranteed performance, high reliability levels or hardware-enforced security may be critical.
A complementary challenge comes from the hardware limitations of today's processor architectures, especially for delivering high computing performance in low power envelopes. This is a serious problem for the development of very promising application areas, e.g. at the convergence between high performance computing, big data and deep learning.
To overcome these limitations, there is the need to develop a new generation of innovative, secure and reliable processors for systems based on highly parallel and heterogeneous architectures. Targeted markets are high performance computing and server workloads where energy efficiency, compact physical size and low power consumption are strong requirements.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions
Programming environments and toolboxes for low energy and highly parallel computing: Proposals will provide programming environments and tools optimised for specific application domains of significant economic value, ideally covering the complete software stack from runtime systems to application programming. The solutions proposed will support modern system architectures possibly including those based on heterogeneous processors while allowing for optimization of energy, performance, reliability, time predictability and system cost. All the activities needed in software development should be addressed when relevant; e.g.: remote collaboration, debugging and bug tracking, runtime software analysis. Model-based approaches and reuse and extension of existing platforms, libraries, frameworks and tools are encouraged, resulting ideally in solutions which are practically usable for application development for real-world use cases and provide mechanisms for further future extensions and introduction of new functionalities.
Security by design features allowing applications to be resilient to cyber-attacks are encouraged to be part of the proposed technology, as well as features for energy-aware solutions and for tolerating hardware and software errors while guaranteeing the required service level.
Solutions will be demonstrated in real-life applications through at least two different use cases complementing each other, and will provide significant and measurable improvements over state-of-the-art methods and technologies in productivity, software quality and energy consumption. This should be complemented by appropriate activities to build a community of users to ensure the uptake of the work after the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Research and Innovation Actions
Low power processor technologies: Proposals will provide innovative processor designs delivering a substantial and measurable improvement over the current state of the art in energy/performance ratio for typical high performance computing and server workloads. The limitations of today's technologies will be addressed, e.g. power density, thermal management, memory access speed and latency, efficient on-chip and off-chip communication. The proposed solutions will ideally include hardware-based security features and may optionally include support for real-time applications e.g. guaranteed execution time.
Proposals are expected to go beyond current semiconductor technologies, but also to take into account the reality of semiconductor market both in the technology and in the business model, providing solutions that can be actually manufactured in volume at reasonable cost, and appropriately addressing intellectual property issues. Consortia will include the required expertise to successfully bring hardware design to the market and to provide real-life application requirements from the targeted markets.
A working prototype, based on real-life applications representative of the targeted markets, will be demonstrated before the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one action will be funded.
c. Coordination and Support Actions for structuring and connecting the European academic and industrial research and innovation communities. Activities will include (e.g.) cross-sectorial industrial platform-building, constituency building and consultations, clustering of related projects, and road-mapping for future research and innovation in the area of computing for Cyber-Physical Systems, high performance computing and industrial applications. No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
For ""a. Programming environments and toolboxes"":
Proposals should address one or more of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success where appropriate:
Reinforce and broaden Europe's strong position in low-energy computing by reducing the effort needed to include digital technology inside any type of product or service, including outside the traditional “high-tech” sectors.
Availability of software development environments and tools allowing easy development of applications for parallel and heterogeneous architectures. Tools should be usable in realistic use cases, and should significantly increase the productivity in efficiently programming and maintaining advanced computing systems as compared to the state of the art at the time of proposal writing.
Higher share of European SMEs and mid-caps in the reference markets, both on the supply and the demand side.
For ""b. Low power processor technologies"":
Availability of a new family of processors with a significantly better energy/performance ratio compared to current offerings, specifically tailored for high-performance and low-power server-side applications.
For ""c. Coordination and Support Actions"":
Increased cooperation between industrial and academic communities;
Increased synergy and collaboration between projects, high-quality roadmap for future research and innovation activities in the relevant areas."

As addressed in the multi-annual roadmap[1] of the FoF cPPP, physically-entangled systems used in manufacturing environments have some specific requirements in terms of reliability and security, which are now challenged by the need for manufacturing facilities to be digitally connected with external partners in the value chain. While free flow of data is a primary requirement for digitisation of industry, it poses significant challenges in terms of data security, which cannot be solved easily because the factory of the future must exchange digital information with the outside world just like raw materials and components. There is a need to develop practically usable solutions which can guarantee an adequate level of security without limiting the capability to exchange data and information both on the manufacturing floor and beyond the factory.
Scope:
Proposals need to develop tools and services guaranteeing an adequate level of data security for digital collaboration between manufacturing environments and value chains. Solutions need to be practically usable in real manufacturing facilities, taking into account the operational requirements needed for factory usage in real-world conditions, including reliability and resilience. Issues of threat detection and implementation of countermeasures should be addressed, as well as evolution and real-time response when needed. Semi-autonomous or fully autonomous solutions, requiring little or no local supervision are encouraged.
Proposals will target TRL 5 to 7, and will include at least one use case which will demonstrate measurable and significant improvements over state of the art tools and methods under real-world conditions. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Specific Challenge: Experimentally-driven research and innovation is a key mechanism towards advancement in Internet technology and applications. Europe needs a Strategic Experimental Infrastructure for Future Internet Research & Experimentation (FIRE+) available to experiments of any size, complexity, or networking technology. Experimenters need to run experiments under controlled and replicable conditions, according to specific requirements by accessing real or virtual equipment, services, systems and tools on demand, seamlessly and regardless of their geographical location. Additionally, a dynamic and promising segment of experimenters, comprising in particular individuals, small and medium-size developers and innovators cannot afford testbeds or even testing equipment of their own and need to be provided easy and affordable access to said capacities. Real-world prototyping and experimenting environments are needed in certain cases for innovation creation. In addition, Future Internet Research and Experimentation in Europe could benefit from similar initiatives around the world.
Scope:
a.      Research & Innovation Actions: proposals are expected to cover one or more of the themes identified below, but not necessarily all of them.
Collaborative projects for the creation, reconfiguration and/or extension of experimental infrastructures. Proposals in any of the following areas are encouraged: Mobile and Wireless, Cloud, Spectrum, Photonics, Internet of Things (IoT), Distributed Service Platforms, Sensors; as well as proposals allowing experimenters to manage, analyse and extract value from data acquired from sensors, mobile devices and/or online interactions in social and real networks.
Proposals with an experimentation aspect that will leverage Europe's Research and Education Network infrastructure (GÉANT). Major emphasis will be put on the integration of real-world devices across all communication layers, in order to really deliver to the end-user.
Proposals to develop the concepts of Experimentation-as-a-Service (EaaS) and Virtual Experimentation. In particular, proposals must allow ad hoc, on demand federation and reconfiguration of facilities and platforms, in order to serve the researcher and development requirements and provide tools for reporting, benchmarking and monitoring.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users, experimenters and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 150.000 per party).  At least 50% of the EU funding should be allocated to this purpose.
b.      Innovation Actions
Proposals for a collaborative project that would identify, evaluate and select ideas for prototyping and experimentation, testing and validation and enable the step towards actual experimentation planning and execution on top of FIRE+. Ideas and experiments would come from the Future Internet constituency at large, as well as from non-Future Internet constituencies and the setting would be in real world environments, where applicable.
c.       Coordination and Support Actions: proposals are expected to cover one or more of the themes identified below, but not necessarily all of them.
         Identification of European, national and regional experimental facilities, testbeds and laboratories available for integration into FIRE+ in a heterogeneous but reconfigurable and evolving arrangement. The resulting experimental infrastructure must be extensive, span various technologies and allow for integration on demand in response to experimenters' and users' needs.
         Identification, evaluation and roadmap of the future needs for advanced networking experimentation and ancillary services with a large-scale experimental need on top of existing or future facilities under FIRE+.
         Coordination and Support action for international cooperation: Proposals for concrete, reciprocal actions in the short and medium term. The primary target is the cooperation between the EU and the US, but the preparation for multilateral experimentation and federation with other initiatives around the world can also be addressed. These actions will organise workshops linked to concrete actions on joint developments; they will invite US testbeds to join Open Calls of FIRE projects either for experiments or for linking facilities, where each side would fund its own part and GEANT would provide the link; they will also promote EU developments towards the US and reciprocate the exchange of researchers using an Erasmus Mundus-like subscription/selection system.
Expected impact:
         Experimental capability at European level that covers a variety of networking technology areas and allows tens of experiments to be run on top of them each year.
         A reliable, diversified infrastructure of approximately ten world-class experimental facilities and platforms, covering different aspects of advanced networking and applications.
         Potential to experiment without the constraints of the physical location or access to a specific experimental facility.
         Development of common architectures across the various prototypes and experiments across a variety of settings and/or application areas.
         Economies of scale in terms of infrastructure and its management by promoting the utilization of existing shared experimental facilities and platforms by experiments under other specific challenges.
         Reduction of the time to experiment by allowing a larger set of experiments to take place on reliable and benchmarked infrastructure that can evolve and be re-configured.
         Response to the needs of individual, small and medium experimenters without access to experimental facilities or environments.
         Positive impact on application areas other than Future Internet, for example Societal Challenges and in particular Smart Cities enabled by advanced Future Internet Infrastructure, via large-scale experimentation involving users.
         Concrete cooperation and cross-fertilisation between European and US initiatives in experimentally-driven research as a first step towards a wider collaboration with other countries, for example Japan, Brazil and South Korea.
         Contribution to standardisation and interoperability of experimental facilities.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
RAS technology has evolved significantly in the past decade, moving robots out of constrained environments and into the workplace or home. Technologies ranging from mechatronics to sensing, manipulation and mobility have all contributed to this evolution. However the easy deployment of smart robots in everyday life is still beyond the technical capability of most current laboratory prototypes.
The specific challenge here is to develop robots that respond more flexibly, robustly and efficiently to the everyday needs of workers and citizens in professional or domestic environments, and which will also maintain Europe at the forefront of global research and development. The actions will address the whole research value chain, whether generic technology, developing RAS building blocks in the form of key technical capabilities, or market-led prototypes directly involving end users. End users will help drive Innovation Actions as active partners, setting the operating parameters for a given application as well as testing and validating the prototype solutions.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions addressing generic advances and technical capabilities:
a. Open, generic forward-looking research into novel technical advances in robotics – open to all robotics-related research topics and disciplines. Proposals are expected to address technical topics which cut across application domains and which can be developed further with a view to achieving high future impact on markets or societal sectors in Europe.
b. Technology research and development to achieve step changes in the capabilities of the following high priority RAS technologies: systems development, human-robot interaction, mechatronics, perception, navigation and cognition. Step changes are sought through either a multiplicative improvement in technical capability, for example achieving a difference in order of magnitude in the number of everyday objects a robot can recognise or handle, or a categorical advance, for example moving from rigid to intuitive human-robot interfaces.
The Commission considers that the open research and the technical capabilities proposals are expected to require EUR 2 to 4 million each; nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported for each bullet (a or b above). Proposals are expected to identify which bullet is their main centre of gravity.
Innovation Actions driven by end users:
c. Improving the deployment prospects of RAS through end user-driven application developments in domains and application areas with significant market potential. Proposals are expected to address system development beyond TRL 5.[1]
The outputs will not be purely technological; actions will generate economic and operational data that will provide a valuable basis for setting operating parameters and for reducing commercial risks for future investors.
d. Filling technology or regulatory gaps through end user-driven innovation actions, where the gap represents a challenging market entry barrier. Proposals are expected to address a gap in either technical capability or system ability. The targeted gap and the required steps to tackle the gap must be clearly identified in the proposal.

At least one action will be supported for each bullet (c or d above). Proposals are expected to identify which bullet is their main centre of gravity.
Expected Impact:
The expected impacts for the Research and Innovation Actions are:
Promote excellent science and technology knowledge in Europe, demonstrated by a high standard of research outputs (including publications, open source software or, as appropriate, patents);
Develop a new generation of robotic and autonomous systems with clear and measurable progress over the state of the art in terms of step changes in technical capabilities, as evidenced by improvements in performance (including in terms of affordability, reliability and robustness, energy autonomy and user acceptability);
Greater industrial relevance of research actions and output as demonstrated by deeper involvement of industry and stronger take-up of research results;
Fostering new links between academia and industry, accelerating and broadening technology transfer;
Contributing by 2020 to the strategic vision of a more competitive positioning of European robotics providers in the marketplace, in terms of their penetration in new or emerging robotics sectors.
The expected impacts for the Innovation Actions on end-user research are:
Increasing the market-readiness of robotics applications including in terms of technological validation outside the laboratory and of sound operational and cost-benefit models;
Lowering of market entry barriers of a business or regulatory nature and increasing industrial and commercial investment in Europe at a rate comparable with other global regions;[2]
Contributing to the faster growth of competitive small and mid-scale robotics companies in Europe.

While the state-of-the-art micro/nano-electronics technologies and their manufacturing are being further advanced towards market-readiness in the context of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, it is essential to prepare for the future of the electronics industry the next wave of industry-relevant technologies to extend the limits (technological and/or economic) mainstream technologies will be facing in the medium term[1]. This is essential to maintain and increase Europe's longer-term capacity in the design and manufacturing of these technologies and to strengthen the competitiveness and market leadership of the many industries innovating through these technologies.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation actions
The work must be in the scope of one of the following topics:
the development of new approaches to scale functional performance of information processing and storage substantially beyond the state-of-the-art technologies with a focus on ultra-low power and high performance. Work may address materials, processes, device and component architectures, system micro-architectures (processor and memory), security, design, modelling, simulation and nano-characterization, and must consider integration, systemability and manufacturability. Technologies exploiting the quantum effects in solid-state devices are also relevant. Advanced explorative technology development at TRL 2-3 is called for.
3D sequential integration (at transistor scale) possibly mixed with 3D parallel integration (at circuit level) for system solutions to increase functionalities and capabilities. Work could address interconnects (intra-layer and vertical structures), design challenges (3D design kits and tools, power models and optimization), prototyping and test methods. Proposals at TRL 2-3 are called for.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in H2020, cooperation is encouraged with countries that have substantial research in the area (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA).
In the particular case of Japan and Korea, the call is open to project twinning. Proposals for twinning with entities participating in projects funded by Research and Innovation programmes in Japan and Korea shall foresee budget provisions to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies. Project twinning will be implemented on a bilateral basis by clustering of projects on nanoelectronics topics of mutual interest.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Innovation action[2]
In Equipment Assessment Experiments, suppliers of innovative high-tech equipment install, assess and validate their prototypes or products that have left the R&D phase in environments that are very close to real-life conditions in cooperation with end-user. Proposals at TRL 6-7 are called for.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c. Coordination and Support actions
In view of promoting the attractiveness of careers in micro/nanoelectronics towards young people, a dedicated pan-European challenge event should be proposed to showcase the possibilities offered by state-of-the-art hardware technologies (similar to the European code week for software apps). The sustainability of this event should also be addressed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address the following impact criteria and provide metrics to measure and monitor success
a. Research and Innovation actions
The actions will aim at contributing to the future growth in Europe of the micro-/nanoelectronics and related industries.
The proposals must describe how the proposed developments of new/enabling technologies will contribute to the target of doubling the economic value of semiconductor component production in Europe within the next 10 years as set by the Electronics Leaders Group in their strategic roadmap[3] and implementation plan[4].
The proposals must outline a realistic roadmap for further progressing on the TRL range beyond the project timeframe and a concrete business perspective describing expected markets for the industrial partners and impact for European industry and society at large.
b. Innovation actions
Proposals should clearly demonstrate the route from assessment to first use of the equipment. The user requirements of the equipment to be assessed should represent significant improvements to existing equipment in terms of capability, precision, efficiency or other characteristics opening new avenues of deployment.
c. Coordination and Support actions
The actions will raise the awareness of young people for the potential offered by a technological career thereby attracting more students to the field.
The proposed event should have ambitious targets in the number of participations (reach-out to thousands of students) and the scope of the activities (designs and prototypes) to be showcased.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The fast evolution of ICT technology together with the uses that are made of it are exponentially introducing new threats, vulnerabilities and risks. There is a growing consensus that the state-of-the-art approach to secure ICT is becoming obsolete and, in addition, the walled-garden concept for security is becoming invalid.
The challenge is to find solutions guaranteeing end-to-end security that withstands progress for the lifespan of the application it supports, regardless of improvements in attacker hardware or computational capabilities.
Scope:
a.      Research & Innovation Actions
         Security-by-design for end-to-end security
Security-by-design paradigms have to be developed and tested, to providing end-to-end security, across all hardware and software layers of an ICT system and application and business services. Special attention has to be paid to the interaction of the layers and to a holistic approach. Platform independent solutions are needed to provide context aware and self-adaptive security in highly connected, complex and interoperable networks.
Automated security policy governance for such environments has to be addressed, allowing for run-time verification, customisation and enforcement between operators or virtual entities, in multi-layer and multi-service systems, spanning multiple domains or jurisdictions.
Open and dynamically reconfigurable environments need special attention, as well as environments where the user or provider has to rely on other providers, not necessarily of trustworthy origin.
The developed security-by-design solutions are expected to be usable in their deployment and implementation in order to decrease the security risks associated with improper use or misconfiguration and thereby allowing the user to trust devices and services intuitively.
         Cryptography
Research projects have to address the key challenges to guarantee the security for the lifespan of the application it supports, to stay ahead of the evolution of the ICT environment and keep pace with the performance increase of ICT technology. The challenges to be addressed include:
-       Resource efficient and highly secure technology for hardware based real-time cryptography;
-       Resource efficient, real-time, highly secure fully homomorphic cryptography;
-       Distributed cryptography including functional cryptography;
-       Cryptographic tools for securely binding applications to software, firmware and hardware environments, with or without the possibility to adapt the cryptographic primitives which are used;
-       Post-quantum cryptography for long term security;
-       Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems and networks for long-term security by design, as well as networks supporting information theoretic cryptographic primitives, including but not restricted to the integration into existing optical networks (e.g. trusted nodes and/or using multiplexing), addressing:
                                        i.    low cost components for short-distance, low-bit-rate quantum key-distribution;
                                      ii.    high-bit rate QKD systems that are tolerant to noise and loss.
Projects have to demonstrate a net increase in performance, or reduction in energy or power consumption, compared to state-of-the-art approaches and have to validate the proposed technology in realistic application scenarios, taking into account the current trends in ICT like cloud, mobile, IoT, etc. Activities may include methods for provable security against physical attacks, as well as research toward security certification.
b.      Activities supporting the Cryptography Community
To complement the research activities in cryptography support and coordination actions should address the following aspects:
-       ensure a durable integration and structuring of the European cryptography community, involving academia, industry, law enforcement and defence agencies.
-       strengthen European excellence in this domain.
-       provide technology watch, joint research agendas and foresight studies.
-       identify technology gaps, market and implementation opportunities.
-       provide technical expertise to the cybersecurity and privacy communities.
-       contribute to the development of European standards, including for the public sector.
-       solve training needs and skill shortage of academia and industry.
-       evaluation and verification of cryptographic protocols and algorithms.
-       organize open competitions with security and implementation benchmarking.
-       dissemination and outreach, strengthening the link with institutional stakeholders.
Expected impact:
At macro level:
         a new paradigm for the design and implementation of ICT technology.
         ICT designed in Europe offering a higher level of security and/or privacy compared to non-European ICT products and services.
         ICT products and services compliant with Europe's security and privacy regulation.
         ICT with a measurably higher level of security and/or privacy, at marginal additional cost compared to ICT technology following the traditional designs (i.e. implementing security as add-on functionality).
At societal level:
         increase user trust in ICT and online services.
         improve users' ability to detect breaches of security and privacy.
         improved protection of the user's privacy, in compliance with applicable legislation.
         more resilient critical infrastructures and services.
At research and innovation level: a new generation of ICT systems, applications and services that
         empowers users to take control over their data and trust relations.
         provides security and privacy as a built-in feature, simpler to understand and manage for the user compared to traditional ICT.
         ICT solutions allowing the user to monitor if her/his rights-online are respected and in compliance with the EU regulation.
         simplify the implementation of cryptographic primitives.
         ICT technology that is proofed to be more secure than ICT designed the traditional way.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe too many promising high tech start-ups or innovative SMEs do not manage to grow and scale up at pan-European or international level. The tendency is that they either remain within a restricted national market or, if they manage to emerge, are often bought while they are still too small, thus failing to become full actors on the international scene and to create a sound ecosystem around their success. Beyond this, turning research results with high innovation potential into viable products and services, bringing them to the market at European or even global level remains a big challenge.
Scope:
Leveraging the Startup Europe[1] and Innovation Radar[2] initiatives, actions within this topic should on the one hand help established startups and prospective tech entrepreneurs to achieve market success and, on the other, raise broader awareness of high potential innovators in Europe with specific targeted actions for maturing innovation excellence in EU-funded ICT projects. Actions should support the expansion of startups on a pan-European and international level. They should stimulate further tech entrepreneurship and the creation of new high growth businesses and jobs, seeking maximum synergies through European innovation ecosystems. Innovators targeted by the Innovation Radar include startups, SMEs, spinoffs and research teams. Innovators identified, promoted and supported by the Innovation Radar are expected to enriching and benefiting from, the Startup Europe ecosystem.
a. Innovation actions
Proposers should cover one or both of the following themes:
Reinforcing ICT ecosystems for high growth tech startups by interconnecting and creating new synergies between 3-4 different Startup hubs across Europe per project. Activities should focus on scaling-up of companies by connecting, across different entrepreneurial ecosystems, key relevant stakeholders such as tech entrepreneurs, mentors, corporates, customers, artists, designers, media, investors and local authorities. Cross-border actions can include, strategic partnerships among the players from local startups hubs across Europe; actions to help startups to find skilled employees throughout the connected hubs; access to the right combination of finance; helping startups to have access to procurement opportunities; and provide information to allow startups to grow across borders.
Facilitating financing and improving the liquidity for European investments in fast growing ICT startups and scaleups, increasing their chances for a successful exit. Activities should support networking for corporates, help EU and international investors to gather and improve knowledge of opportunities for investing in digital sectors as well as stimulating financing through European stock markets, preparing companies for investment, enlarging the pool of investors and analysts with deeper understanding of market trends and business models in digital sectors.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 1.5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Minimum one action will be selected for each of the themes described.
b. Coordination and Support actions
These actions shall primarily be targeted towards technologies developed in EU funded ICT projects (from Framework Programme 7, Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and Horizon 2020).
In the framework of DG Connect’s ""Innovation Radar"" initiative, offering tailored support to innovators in order to turn their research results into marketable products and, preparing such innovators for success in the market place. Support services will help EU-funded innovators with promising innovations and prepare for market introduction or technology transfer. Actions to champion and provide recognition to best-in-class ICT innovators and innovations from ICT specific programmes e.g. through organisation of recognition prizes, quality labelling, facilitating participation in relevant and impactful events, meeting corporate or institutional investors, procurers, potential customers or partners.
Establishing a European wide network of nodes supporting primarily the needs of EU framework programme innovators in delivering pre-seed workshops for market-oriented researchers; practitioner-led, customer and user-centred, hands-on courses based on proven, state of the art methodologies for the development of business models for growth (e.g. customer discovery, lean startup, business model canvas, minimum viable product). Such courses are to be tailored to researchers, innovators and ICT based high-tech startups and should include interaction with prospective customers and users and where relevant taking into account market and regulatory conditions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around 1 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Minimum one action will be selected for each of the themes described.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address the following and provide appropriate metrics for measuring success with respect to a defined baseline:
a. Innovation actions
Connecting tech start-up hubs and their companies (startups, scaleups) to the larger European business ecosystem seeking maximum synergies in terms of number of concrete collaborations between relevant players within existing ecosystems and networks;
Increased access to customers, new products or services on the market, increase in turnover, better access to qualified employees, access to the right combination of finance and prospects for scaling up across borders and new job opportunities;
Stimulate European investments in digital sectors through creating increased mutual understanding between investor communities and in particular tech startups and scaleups;
Demonstrate sustainability of proposed actions beyond the life of the project;
Where appropriate, seeking synergies with ESIF funds or ESIF supported actions to improve the synergies between H2020 and ESIF.
b. Coordination and Support actions
Increase the number of digital technology based spin-offs and startups or successfully transferred technology from EU funded projects;
Enable a significant number of companies based on ICT technologies to reach investment maturity and market introduction readiness;
Enable innovators from EU funded projects to be part of the relevant EU networks created by Startup Europe;
Where appropriate, seeking synergies with ESIF funds or ESIF supported actions in order to improve the synergies between H2020 and ESIF.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Enforcing the effectiveness of National Contact Points (NCP) for ICT in H2020 by supporting trans-national cooperation within this network and strengthening collaboration with other R&I support networks at the European level.
Scope: The action will focus on establishing mechanisms for effective cross border partnership searches, identifying, understanding and sharing good practices ensuring this target. This may entail benchmarking of services and support mechanisms, joint workshops and collaboration with other H2020 NCPs, training, twinning schemes, elaboration of relevant training and information material for proposers and the operation of an effective partner search mechanism across the network of NCPs. Practical initiatives to benefit cross-border audiences may also be included, such as trans-national brokerage events.  The specific approach should be adapted to the nature of the theme and to the capacities and priorities of the NCPs concerned. A degree of collaboration and networking with similar projects in parallel themes – especially in the context of joint/coordinated calls will be encouraged. The focus throughout should be on issues specific to ICT in H2020 and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under 'Science with and for Society'.
Special attention should be given to helping less experienced NCPs to access the know-how accumulated in other countries and to apply it in a locally relevant and efficient manner. The ICT NCP network should develop information and support services along the full research and innovation value chain for all ICT clients, in particular new target groups in H2020 (e.g. SME, public authorities).
Proposals are expected to include or enable the active participation of all NCPs which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities in the EU and associated countries.  In special cases the NCPs can decide to subcontract this activity to specialist agencies.  Proposals from other organisations in the EU and Associated States are ineligible. If certain NCPs wish to abstain from participating, this fact should be explicitly documented in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and  the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission. The action may also involve official ICT H2020 contacts from third countries.
The Commission expects to receive a single proposal under this topic. It is expected that the project should last for a period of four years.
Expected impact:
         An improved more homogeneous NCP service across Europe and beyond, helping to establish cross border consortia, simplify access to H2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the quality of submitted proposals.
         A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe, closely integrated with other NCP networks, ERA-NET Cofunds, JTIs, related European programs and EEN services.
         More effective participation of organizations from third countries, alongside European organizations, in line with the principle of mutual benefit.

","08 December 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
ECB and FP7 impact studies point out that the biggest challenge faced by innovative companies in Europe is not to find funding for R&I but to find a first customer. The challenge is to facilitate access of innovative companies to the market by removing barriers to Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) and Public Procurement of Innovative solutions (PPI) in Europe. Cross-border cooperation among procurers and defragmentation of public demand are key in this respect as potential market size is the most important decision factor for firms to participate or not in a public procurement. Speeding up of implementation cycles and further networking of national innovation procurement competence centres are also needed.
Scope:
Coordination and Support actions
Proposals should focus on one of the two themes below:
a. The objective is to support the creation of European wide networks of procurers (European Public Procurers networks) that define together an innovation procurement roadmap, identifying shared procurement needs in the near term (relevant for PPI) as well as mid-to-long term (relevant for PCP) in areas of common European interest.
European Public Procurers (EPP) networks are expected to engage into an open dialogue with all potential stakeholders, including other procurers and end-users. EPP networks are encouraged to publish their perceived procurement needs online, in a way that enables the research and innovation community to comment and submit ideas to make suggestions for future PCPs or PPIs.. EPP networks should also undertake activities that investigate the feasibility and facilitate the concrete preparation of a cross-border PCP or PPI for at least one shared common procurement need.
EPP networks should contain a critical mass of public procurers responsible for the acquisition and/or regulatory strategy for innovative solutions in areas of public interest that are large potential customers for ICT LEIT technologies. EPP networks should also undertake dissemination activities to share results and raise awareness about PCP and PPI across Europe.
b. The objective is to support the creation of one EU wide network of national competence centers on innovation procurement (PCP and PPI)[1]. Activities undertaken by the network are expected to include the creation of new national innovation competence centers and the enlarging of the scope of existing competence centers. They should also include experience sharing on PCP/PPI implementation across Europe, promoting Horizon 2020 funding and synergies with ESIF funding for PCP and PPI to ICT procurers in cooperation with NCPs, assisting ICT procurers in starting up such procurements nationally and collaborating cross-border to facilitate also transnational joint procurement.
In cooperation with policy makers, the network should also develop and coordinate policy actions to mainstream PCP and PPI across Europe such as setting targets and developing financial incentive schemes for procurers to undertake PCP and PPI.
The network is expected to maximize synergies with national and ESIF funding and focus the budget requested from Horizon 2020 on activities/partners that cannot be funded from ESIF or for which national funding is not available.
The expected duration for the action is 4 years. The minimum participation is 5 existing national innovation procurement competence centers plus 5 public bodies that have the mandate to setup 5 new innovation procurement competence centers (in total from 10 different Member States or associated countries), aiming for EU wide participation of innovation procurement centers in the network by the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
More forward-looking, concerted approach to develop common answers to challenges faced by the public sector in a number of countries. Increased opportunities for the supply side to present the potential of innovative solutions the demand side in order to address concrete public sector challenges. Reduced fragmentation of public sector demand through definition of common specifications and preparation of cross-border procurements.
Increased awareness on PCP and PPI among policy makers and procurers. Enhanced capacity of the public sector to carry out PCPs and PPIs. Increased amount of PCPs and PPIs taking place at national and EU level (Horizon 2020 and ESIF funded). Creation of 5 new innovation competence centers and enlarged scope of the support to public procurers provided by 5 existing competence centers, in a way that maximizes synergies with national and ESIF funding.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Innovation Procurement

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This specific challenge addresses the lack of public demand-driven innovation in Europe needed to close the gap between supply and demand for innovative ICT solutions. It targets consortia of procurers with similar procurement needs of common European interest, to drive innovation from the demand side and reduce fragmentation of public sector demand in Europe. The aim of engaging in such forward looking R&D procurement strategies is to modernize the provision of public services faster whilst creating opportunities for industry and researchers in Europe to take international leadership in new markets.
Scope:
PCP Actions
The objective is to bring radical improvements to the quality and efficiency of public services by encouraging the development and validation of breakthrough solutions through Pre-Commercial Procurement. This topic is open to proposals for pre-commercial procurement actions in all areas of public sector interest requiring innovative ICT based solutions. The work will complement PCP Actions foreseen under other challenges in ICT LEIT. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific ICT technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different ICT technologies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Reduced fragmentation of demand for innovative solutions by enabling public procurers to collectively implement PCPs in areas, which due to their nature are better addressed jointly, or which they would not have been able to tackle independently;
Increased opportunities for wide market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side through the use of joint specifications, wide publication of results and where relevant contribution to standardisation, regulation or certification.

","Coordination and support action, Innovation action, Research and Innovation action
","19 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The advancement of photonics depends on core photonics technology which can be applied in many different application areas. The challenge is to develop and apply core photonics technology for the next generation of devices (including components, modules and sub-systems) in order to drive innovation in key application areas, which are significant current or future markets and where photonics can bring a key competitive advantage.
Innovative photonic sensing solutions can contribute to reducing food production losses and food wastes, estimated in Europe at about 300 kg per capita, and to increasing food safety for the end consumer along the food production chain from farm to fork.
Increased pollution of air, soil and water is raising new concerns regarding the safety of the environment and its potential risks for European citizens’ health. Distributed smart photonic sensor networks involving public participation through community-based monitoring could assist in creating inventories of emitted pollutants, identifying pollution hotspots, and alerting citizens in real time on potential health risks.
Scope:
The focus is on the following themes (sub-topics):
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
i. Flexible Farm-to-Fork Sensing: Development of an innovative smart photonic sensor solution, utilizing an appropriate bandwidth between the ultraviolet (UV) and the far infrared spectral range for monitoring food quality with respect to microbiological and chemical contamination along the farm-to-fork food production chain. The targeted solution should combine photonic sensing technology with advanced data analysis techniques and be portable, easy-to-use, flexible, and broadly adaptable for usage on farms, in food processing, wholesale and retail. Actions should focus on the following areas: (1) food production by small/medium-sized farms; (2) novel types of food production, such as aquaponics; (3) on-site food processing and vending (e.g. on farms or local food markets). The developed solution must be demonstrated in real settings involving relevant stakeholders along the food supply chain, from food producers to end consumers.
ii. Novel Photonics Integrated Circuit (PIC) Technology building blocks: Major advances in photonic integrated circuit technology through the development of building blocks with significantly enhanced or novel functions. These should form part of comprehensive integration platforms for established or new important application fields, enabling the platform to meet the demands of application roadmaps concerning relevant features like sensitivity, energy efficiency, speed and chip density. Developments should be based on a generic platform approach, i.e. support the single-chip integration of complex functions through a design flow based on generic building blocks separated from production. Actions should include a validation of results with fabricated PIC prototypes.
b) Innovation Actions (IA)
iii. Smart Photonic Sensing for Environmental Pollution Detection: Prototyping, demonstration and validation in real settings of an innovative, cost-effective, portable, smart hyperspectral sensing system operating in the visible to mid-infrared spectral range, for pollution detection in environmental sensing applications. The system should be based on a miniaturised optical setup and feature broad sensorial response curves with high measurement precision in the diagnostic wavelength range, in combination with massive Cloud-based data analysis capability using advanced Deep Learning algorithms and Big Data sensor signal repositories for comprehensive chemometric analysis.
c) Coordination and Support Actions
iv. An industrial strategy for photonics in Europe: the objective is to support the development and implementation of a comprehensive industrial strategy for photonics in Europe which strengthens the links to the end user industries. The action should include the development of strategic technology road-maps, strong stakeholder engagement (in particular Photonics21 stakeholders, National Technology Platforms, regional Clusters, end-user industries), coordination of regional, national and European strategies and priorities, and development and dissemination of financing models to facilitate access by companies to different sources of finance.
To ensure domain coverage, at least one proposal will be selected to cover each of these themes. As it is necessary to coordinate strategy efforts singly, no more than one action will be funded for theme iv).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million for themes i and ii; EUR 4 and 7 million for theme iii, and up to EUR 4 million for theme iv would allow these to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should describe how the proposed work will contribute to the relevant expected impacts and metrics, including a baseline and the targets to measure impact. Respectively:
Increased food yield, quality and safety, and significant reduction of food waste along the farm-to-fork food production chain with cost-effective and easy-to-use analysis and quality-control tools;
Strengthening small/medium-scale farming and local or novel ways of food production and processing by ensuring high food quality standards at lower resource usage and competitive costs.
Reduction of the research and development costs of advanced PICs in a wide range of application areas.
Large-scale adoption of affordable, Cloud-connected, smart photonic sensing systems for pervasive, Community-based environmental pollution monitoring and real-time citizen alert on local pollution levels and related health risks
Reinforced value chains and deployment of photonics technologies by stronger cooperation of photonics stakeholders, clusters and end-users;
Increased competitiveness of the European photonics sector and improved access to risk finance for the photonics sector in Europe.

Specific Challenge: The challenge is to provide for discussions with third countries on areas of common interest and to provide support to collaboration within the ICT research and innovation domains.
Scope: The twofold target is:
         to support dialogues between the European Commission/the EU and strategic high income partner countries and regions,
and
         to foster cooperation with strategic high income third country organisations in collaborative ICT R&D both within the EU's Framework Programmes (Horizon 2020) and under relevant third country programmes.
Proposals must cover these two aspects which could include in particular:
         the organisation of events synchronised with dialogue meetings[1], providing timely input and follow-up for example on common R&D priorities and future cooperation opportunities, assisting in focusing dialogue meetings as well as increasing their visibility,
         enhance cooperation on ICT policy and regulation through monitoring of the targeted region/country, workshops or any other relevant activity,
         strengthening of cooperative research links through the set-up of sustainable cooperative mechanisms or platforms between European organisations and relevant leading third country organisations, with the aim of establishing mutually beneficial partnerships based on synergies to be identified between the Digital Agenda for Europe's (DAE) international agenda and third countries/regions' ICT strategies,
         reinforcement of industrial cooperation on ICT research and development, notably through a better networking between European ICT Technology Platforms and relevant associations in third countries,
         increased co-ordination at EU level with horizontal Framework Programme instruments to promote international cooperation (such as BILAT, INCO-NET and ERA-NET Cofund), as well as relevant EU Member State and Associated Countries programmes.

The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation must be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge ODI and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will offer to complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of ICT innovations.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably through private co-investments and/or follow-up investments in successfully supported SMEs.
The expected impact should be clearly substantiated in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

Standards and interoperability for digital technologies play a crucial role as a foundation of an effective Digital Single Market. There are ever more bodies and organisations involved in ICT standard setting around the world. The challenge is to improve cooperation, reinforce the involvement of European specialists and increase the focus in order to ensure that the EU's priorities and the DSM perspectives are sufficiently represented in the entire spectrum of organisations.
Scope:
The aim is to reinforce the EU and associated states presence in the international ICT standardisation scene, by setting up a standardisation observatory and a facility supporting the participation of key European specialists (especially from SMEs and Academia) in key international and global SDOs and consortia.
Key tasks to be carried out are:
Mapping of the relevant activities in international ICT standardisation where reinforced European resources are needed. When relevant hosting standardisation meetings and workshops in Europe.
Setting up of a management facility to support participation and leadership (e.g. chairing of technical committees) of key European specialists (incl. from SMEs and academia) in those organisations and technical bodies identified. The aim should be to achieve critical mass from industry, including SMEs and Startups, and academia for emerging standardisation activities.
Liaise with relevant on-going developments in EU and national funded R&I projects, in particular with projects having identified standardisation output or with potential relevant results, including as well other coordination and support actions, and relevant PPPs.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
While robots originated in large-scale mass manufacturing, they are now spreading to more and more application areas. In these new settings, robots are often faced with new technical and non-technical challenges. The purpose of this topic is to address such issues in a modular and open way, and reduce the barriers that prevent a more widespread adoption of robots. Four Priority Areas (PAs) are targeted: healthcare, inspection and maintenance of infrastructure, agri-food, and agile production.
In each of these PAs it is critical to develop appropriate autonomous capability that has impact on the efficiency of key applications in the PAs and moves beyond the current state of the art. This capability is built from core technologies and is proved and tested through pilot demonstrators that embed within real or near real environments.
User needs, safety, ethical, gender, legal, societal and economic aspects should be addressed in order to raise awareness and take-up by citizens and businesses. Privacy and cybersecurity issues, including security by design and data integrity should also be addressed, where appropriate.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA) - Robotics Core Technology
Autonomy in robotic systems is built on a combination of four Core Technologies:
AI and Cognition: AI provides tools to make systems cognitive. Cognition equips robots with the ability to safely interact with people, their environments or other robots, to learn and to categorise, to make decisions and to derive knowledge.
Cognitive Mechatronics: Mechatronic systems where sensing and actuation are closely coupled with cognitive systems are expected to deliver improved control, motion, interaction (including all modalities), adaptation and learning, and safer systems.
Socially cooperative human-robot interaction: Cooperative human-robot interaction is critical in many work environments from collaborative support, e.g. passing tools to a worker, navigation in complex work environments, human-friendly and human assistive interactions, to the design of exo-skeletons able to provide motion that is sympathetic to the user.
Model-based design and configuration tools: Deploying robotics at scale in application areas where tasks need to be defined by the user requires easy-to-use configuration tools. Embedding and sharing of knowledge between tools is essential, as is standardisation across the interfaces to connect systems and modules (taking into account cybersecurity issues, including security by design and data integrity).
Proposals should address one of the four core technologies and target the development of core technology modules (modular, open and non-proprietary) and tool kits for use in deployable system platforms that meet the requirements of applications in the following four prioritised application areas: Healthcare, Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance, Agri-Food and Agile Production. Proposals will be required to dedicate resource for connecting with the DIH actions arising from DT-ICT-02-2018.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 7 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals are requested to specify the Core Technology in which their centre of gravity lies. At least one action in each Core Technology will be funded.
b) Innovation Actions (IA) - Robotics for agri-food, and agile production
Establish large-scale pilots capable of demonstrating the use of robotics at scale in actual or highly realistic operating environments; showcase advanced prototype applications built around platforms operating in real or near-real environments and demonstrate high levels of socio-economic impact.
Through large-scale pilots, proposals are expected to make a significant step forward in platform development in one of the two application areas:
In the Agri-Food sector from farming to processing and distribution
Agile Production.
Starting from suitable reference architectures, platform interfaces are defined, tested via piloting, and supported via ecosystem building preparing their roll-out, and are being evolved over time into standards.
Each proposal is expected to establish large scale pilots. They are expected to: consider utilising existing infrastructure and links to other European, national or private funding sources; identify the long-term sustainability of the pilot; develop scalable technical solutions capable of meeting performance targets; develop metrics and performance measures for the pilot; engage relevant industry stakeholders, including SMEs, in the provision and operation of the pilot, paving the way towards establishing strong collaborations for innovative robotic applications in industry. Proposals will be expected to dedicate resources to disseminate best practice and coordinate access to platforms and demonstrators, in particular in connecting with the Robotics DIHs and Core Technologies actions and other relevant activities, in H2020 and beyond.
Pilots are expected to address both technical and non-technical issues, such as socio-economic impact, novel business models, legal and regulatory, ethical and cyber-security issues and connections to AI, Big Data and IoT. Where appropriate, applications should leverage synergies among EU satellite-based systems for navigation (EGNOS/Galileo), and/or observation (Copernicus) and communication.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 7 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. The objective is to fund at least 3 proposals per application area.
c) Coordination and Support Action (CSA) - Robotics
Proposals should address issues concerning the whole European robotics community and provide support actions that develop awareness and knowledge transfer. Proposals should consider the development of a high-level stakeholder forum and an associated communication strategy; the development of mechanisms that create a continuing discussion around legal and societal issues concerning AI-based robotics technology that leads to strategic development and the dissemination of best practice to robotics stakeholders and particularly to developers and policy makers.
Proposals should address the issues of socio-economic analysis, cyber-security, data protection, ethical and privacy issues that arise from the increased deployment of robotics to ensure that there is relevant and effective strategic development and best practice advice available to robotics stakeholders.
Proposals should address the public understanding of robotics through the development of news articles, public and media engagement and awareness activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Research and Innovation Actions:
Improved technical capability in each of the core technologies over the current state of the art.
A greater range of applications in the prioritised application areas that can be demonstrated at TRL 3 and above.
The lowering of technical barriers within the prioritised applications areas.
Innovation Actions:
Demonstration of the potential for robotics to impact at scale in the chosen application areas prioritised in this call.

Robotics enables a significant part of the economic impact of AI by delivering physical intelligence. Logistics, Healthcare, Agri-Food, Inspection and Maintenance, Mobility, Construction, Decommissioning; all require physical intelligence, for example in object manipulation. Physical intelligence is derived from combinations of underlying functional capabilities and developing these capabilities beyond the state of the art depends on fundamental R&D&I which crosses between technical domains, for example into materials research or human interaction. It is therefore important to enhance the capability of robots by exploring and developing the opportunities offered by novel technical developments related to physical intelligence.
Scope:
Innovative approaches to hard research problems in relation to applications of robotics in promising new areas are particularly encouraged. Proposals are expected to enable substantially improved solutions to challenging technical issues, with a view of take-up in applications with high socio-economic impact and low environmental footprint, where appropriate. Driven by application needs, the work can start from research at low TRL, but proposals are expected to validate their results in sufficiently realistic scenarios in order to demonstrate the potential for take-up in the selected application(s).
The call is open to the following research areas:
Development of autonomous robots at the micro- or millimetre scale capable of energy autonomy on the scale of hours or longer. Developing miniature robots is challenging and the potential of robotics at this scale has not been fully explored.
Integration and use of novel materials for service robotics, for instance active materials (e.g.: soft grippers). Current materials often limit the capability of robots, an exploration of how novel materials can reshape robots is an important innovation. In addition, material enabling the design of easy to maintain, upgrade and recycle robots, would also be an important innovation.
Beyond human speed, general purpose, dexterous manipulation of objects. Raising productivity in many processes will require robots to operate faster than humans in the same task.
Application and integration of non-visual sensing novel for service robotics (including off-board, ambient and multi-scale sensing) to achieve new functionality. Many applications in service robotics need sense data beyond the visual; for example chemical, biological, and physical properties; integrating these non-visual data into interpretation and decision making can enhance tasks by taking them beyond human sensing limitations.
Development of intrinsically safe physical powerful robotic systems with proximity sensing capability for human-scale collaborative tasks. Developing intrinsically safe systems is critical to the uptake of collaborative robotics where robots need to be capable of applying working forces that can potentially cause injury to humans.
Development of variable autonomy systems that significantly extend and enhance the operator’s awareness of the working environment. Sharing autonomy between a human operator and a robot can speed up operations and raise productivity.
Proposals are expected to be inspired by, and demonstrate the capability to address, real end user needs, respecting ethical, legal and social aspects, as appropriate. Proposals will be expected to plan efforts to connect and cooperate with the DIHs, Platforms and other relevant activities of this work programme, as appropriate. Proposals will be expected to deliver integrated TRL 4 demonstrations that show step change performance improvement over the current state of the art in the chosen area.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Strengthening European excellence in Robotics S&T
Boosting the use of robotics in promising application areas
Opening up new markets for robotics
Lowering barriers in the deployment of robotics-based solutions.

The increased complexity of present and emerging ICT systems poses several challenges at software and hardware level including new requirements in terms of integration and cybersecurity. Users require seamless connectivity, abundant computing power and unlimited access to data independently of the underlying infrastructure. Increased levels of adaptability is becoming more and more essential in modern ICT systems in order to manage the needs of highly complex and dynamic environments pushing for continued development and operation (DevOps). Increasing trust, security, reliability while keeping system performance and reducing energy consumption has become non trivial, in a world where billions of devices processing zetabytes of data have to be managed and increased transparency in algorithmic decision making is required. It is therefore required to find new ways of managing this unprecedented complexity in software systems throughout shortened lifecycle: from requirements analysis and design, to development and testing and up to deployment and operations across highly heterogeneous and dynamically self-reconfiguring systems.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
Proposals will address at least one of the following two areas:
Development tools & methods for interoperable, adaptive, secure and trustworthy software. Introduce effective processes and tools for building trustworthy software that adopt to rapidly changing requirements while maintaining key qualities (reliability, availability, performance, security, privacy etc.). They will consist of:
New programming models and software engineering tools with increased validation, verification and testing capabilities for ensuring trustworthiness while incorporating inherent semantic reasoning, self-learning and self-healing mechanisms. Focus should also be given to transparent and unbiased algorithmic decision making for the end-users (including transparency for regulatory control purposes) and the integration of evaluation and control functions in the algorithms by design.
Advanced development environments addressing the increasing complexity of modern software based systems, facilitating faster software development and increased integration between continued development and operations, while maintaining reliability, and clearly indicating and confronting with cyber-threats and weak points in terms of cybersecurity.
Advanced Software systems and architectures:
Self-managed software facilitating the semantic adaptation of entities to dynamically changing contexts and coping with different situations, cyberattacks and hardware and software failures.
Software systems that effectively deal with resources complexity and volatility. Proposed solutions should address the operation in highly heterogeneous environments with wide geographic distribution, loose, weak or unreliable connectivity between key service components, unpredictable affinity to data sources and cyber-dangerous environments. The focus should be in optimizing and pooling resources across disparate infrastructures to deliver prescribed levels of quality of service and security.
The proposals should demonstrate the applicability and viability of the proposed solution across multiple application domains. The use and development of open source software will be encouraged where appropriate to further promote openness, facilitate the sharing of project results and accelerate innovation in Europe through the introduction of novel products and services.

It should enable novel interaction between human and digital systems based on new terminal types embedded in the daily environment, e.g. in cars, doors, mirrors, appliances, and new interfaces recognising gestures, facial expressions, sound and haptics. Work should lead to smart connectivity infrastructure with adaptive topologies that supports a virtually infinite capacity and perceived zero latency, highly diverse device densities and highest reliability and availability[1]. It should lead to professional grade of security and privacy whilst bringing down OPEX, CAPEX, and energy consumption. Focus is notably on:
Provision of seemingly infinite network capacity including innovative spectrum use and management, usability of new bands and radio technologies towards cell free networks including scalable cell-free Massive MIMO, usage integration and optimised management of optical resources, as well as architectures enabling hyper dense ambient networks.
Support for imperceptible latencies through flexible connect-compute technologies and architectures enabling optimised distribution of the latency budgets as a function of the application requirements.
Provision for smart connectivity of massive amounts of things and systems in a scalable, interoperable and cost-efficient way. Energy efficiency and paradigms where consumption moves from connectivity to computing (e.g. Mobile Edge Computing) will be considered.
Support for novel architectures and protocols for adaptive networks, including peer-to-peer, meshed and relay-based, for new mobility paradigms, taking advantage when relevant of cognitive operations making use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning mechanisms, taking a full end-to-end value chain approach, including terminal and application management. Resilience against attacks on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning mechanisms are in scope.
Provide personalised, multi-tenant and perpetual protection based on security, privacy and trust mechanisms required in highly virtualised and software environments, taking into account an end-to-end perspective including hardware security capabilities as well as software processes. Blockchain technologies may be explored in that context.
Proposals may focus on one or several of the above indicative sub-topics, and will bridge towards preparing evolution paths for R&I on smart networks and services in future programmes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 12million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. In particular, initiatives with strong structuring effects across a large set of key industry stakeholders and programmatic impact for future European actions in the domain of Smart Network and Services may target the higher budget range.
Expected Impact:
Smart connectivity technologies for platforms integrating ubiquitous connectivity, storage, and computing resources opening for new service and business models.
Smart connectivity platforms integrating technologies and architectures towards perceived zero latency.
Network scalability towards a high number of resource-constrained (IoT) devices, multiplicity of service requirements, and new user-controlled connectivity paradigms.
Characterisation and availability of secure and trusted environments for software based virtualised networks, including underlying hardware limitations and enabling trusted multi-tenancy.
Innovative radio spectrum use, novel strategies for coverage/service extension, support of novel wireless technologies and use cases through platforms, usability of today unexplored spectrum.
Heterogeneous networks with dynamic topologies for advanced mobility solutions.
Dynamic scalability of network capabilities through availability of managed and enhanced optical resources.
Characterisation of AI and blockchain technologies in the connectivity domain, notably for network/service management and security.
Significant reduction of total cost of ownership through improved operational and capital expenditure efficiency, and energy consumption.

Worldwide, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD), and its global incidence and prevalence are increasing. The 5-year survival of a dialysis patient with DKD is less than 25 percent—worse than most cancers—new treatments are desperately needed to slow and/or reverse disease in this high-risk patient population. In order for DKD trials to be more successful in the future, the research community will need to advance a concerted effort to identify personalized markers to identify patients at high risk of progression, to identify patient subpopulations that are likely to respond to candidate therapeutics and to provide early indications of potential safety issues linked to candidate therapeutic agents.
Scope:
The objectives are to identify and validate candidate biomarkers and/or biomarker panels from existing longitudinal databases. Enhance the understanding of key driver pathways that accelerate progression of DKD, as well as pathways that enable & drive the pathogenesis of DKD in the overall context of diabetes itself. Asses differences between DKD associated with Type 1 DM and Type 2 DM. In parallel with this early work in biomarker identification and profiling of people with DKD, preclinical efforts will leverage longitudinal clinical database findings to identify better in vitro and in vivo models of DKD, identify predictive biomarkers for both efficacy and safety, and identify new druggable target pathways for future drug development. The overarching goal is to provide therapeutic developers with new tools that are acceptable to global regulators to enable and facilitate drug development (e.g. companion diagnostics).
Expected Impact:
The overall Project is expected to significantly advance the understanding of the pathophysiology, heterogeneity and natural history of DKD in patients, improve the knowledge on translatable preclinical models for DKD, and facilitate the development of standardized biomarker panels with both prognostic and predictive capacity to serve as entry criteria for future clinical trial protocols evaluating novel therapies for DKD."

","Research and Innovation action
","09 July 2015
","15 March 2016","Specific Challenge:
The clinical paradigm for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) largely engages patients in the later clinical stages of disease, with the majority of patients and caregivers not seeking and/or receiving care until moderate or severe dementia has ensued. The current clinical paradigm does not support or emphasise the need for early detection, diagnosis or action when symptoms of AD first begin. To compound the issue, many physicians are reluctant to provide a diagnosis, because they perceive AD as an incurable disease without adequate treatment and supports. This lack of urgency not only currently compromises the quality of patient care, but also robs patients of access to available support resources and services. This lack of system preparedness for early action will also dramatically impact patient care once disease modifying agents are available.
The scientific community, many regulatory agencies, and advocacy groups are now aligned on the understanding that AD is a pathophysiologic neurodegenerative brain disorder that begins one or two decades prior to symptomatic presentation. Initial efforts in AD treatment development and clinical diagnostic paradigms focused on the most clinically evident stage of AD, dementia. The dementia stage is now clearly identified as a late stage in the pathological progression of the disease. Despite a shift in the scientific paradigm to address the disease in its earlier pathological stages such as mild dementia, prodromal AD and even at the time of preclinical pathology, the front line of clinical management continues to focus on the later stages of the disease, with most diagnoses occurring at the moderate and severe stages of dementia. Yet, at the same time, treatment development has clearly begun a shift to an earlier paradigm, seeking volunteers at earlier stages of disease (prodromal, mild, and in some geographies, preclinical). This dissociation between when patients are identified by their healthcare providers as having AD and the patient populations needed to develop disease modifying therapies at earlier stages of disease is a significant impediment to successfully accomplishing clinical research with a goal of discovering impactful treatments.
However, clinical trial participation is not the only benefit to a timely diagnosis. Many advocacy groups and AD specialists are now demonstrating that, aside from the clinically available therapies which provide modest benefit, non-pharmaceutical interventions are also available and beneficial for the caregiver and patient. For example, for the patient, increased socialisation, exercise, art programs, nutritional education, cognitive therapy, and clinical trial participation can prove valuable. For the caregiver, appropriate counselling on a variety of topics (such as driving safety/cessation, finances, life planning, non-pharmacological management of behavioural symptoms) can provide substantial improvement in quality of life for both the patient and caregivers. To have the greatest impact, these interventions are best employed in the earliest clinical stages of disease to maximize the benefit throughout all stages of disease. With over 34 million AD patients worldwide, the current clinical paradigm of diagnosing AD in later clinical stages does a disservice. By this time, patients have often declined to the point they lack the insight and judgment to play a participative role in their care, and certainly have declined too far to have participation in clinical trials be an option that they and their loved ones can consider. The field must shift to greater public awareness of the importance of an early diagnosis and improved medical efficiency in identifying AD as soon as clinical symptoms emerge.
Not only could these efforts improve clinical access to treatment and support resources and patient engagement earlier in the stages of disease, they will also help widen the funnel for clinical trial recruitment and earlier treatment development.
There is a need to proactively assess the obstacles to patient presentation and diagnosis. There is a need to determine optimal patient engagement practices in the AD healthcare and clinical trial environments to evolve the field toward improved early patient identification and clinical research involvement. In order to achieve these goals, several broad steps are required:
to collect data on a new early paradigm for diagnostic and therapeutic advancements to help local decision makers;
to broaden the understanding of the experience of AD beyond the last few years of its course;
to increase the connectivity between AD thought leaders and AD clinicians;
to create a sense of urgency for the societal and economic impact of AD, especially among policymakers and governments.
Scope:
Objectives (restricted scope is expected for Phase 1)
to establish multiple key regional project sites (demonstration sites) across Europe to identify and test models of efficient earlier identification of mild AD dementia and prodromal AD patients, and awareness of AD risk;
to assess key tools, mechanisms and processes for community engagement and patient identification and resource utilization in various communities;
to compare and contrast various patient access models and how they contribute to improved detection, diagnosis, and clinical research in these communities;
based on findings, to establish archetypes of patient access models for implementation in similar communities, in synergy and collaboration with existing country specific government and non-government stakeholders;
to advocate and distribute access models for broader application and for replication.
Applicants are expected to address all the above objectives in the Short Proposal (within the available duration and maximum IMI2 contribution) and demonstrate a relevant strategy for achieving them, through partnership with the industry consortium.
This will have to be fully developed with the industry consortium and or associated partners in the Full Proposal.
Expected Impact:
The intention of this action is to initially assess key metrics and access models for prioritization applicability. Methods and metrics should be analysed to measure efficiency and efficacy, and categorized into archetype models customized for various community types. Once successful archetype programs of paradigm shift are identified in successful models, they can be replicated in similar communities. This will be used to facilitate further development of independent efficient care models that engage more patients, engage them earlier in the course of disease, and provide access to a wider array of resources and aimed at improving access and enrolment in clinical research programs."

By 2020, heart disease and stroke will become the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with the number of fatalities projected to increase to more than 24 million by 2030.
Common cardiovascular diseases - heart arrhythmias (primarily atrial fibrillation or AF), heart failure (HF) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) – cause much of this disability. While major advances in the management of these diseases have been achieved, medical management of these cardiovascular patients remains challenging. Current treatment guidelines are often not followed, leaving many patients not or undertreated.
Guideline committees call for more data to inform management recommendations. Ultimately, these data should aid the development of new medications, interventions and targeted management recommendations that improve outcomes, in all patients but in particular in pertinent patient subgroups. Likewise, healthcare providers should have new and improved diagnostics to select the right course of treatment. Such data should also help delay these diseases to more advanced ages.
Although current technology has led to the collection of massive amounts of healthcare data, wide scale exploitation of these data sources has yet to be achieved. This is mainly due to obstacles in the linkage of data, which results in fragmented and isolated datasets. Disease registries capturing incident cases are rare as many patient registries are designed for healthcare administration purposes whereas information on incident cases is crucial for studies of the aetiology and for studies of baseline characterization of patients.
Powerful insights could be generated from the combination or linking of in-patient and out-patient hospital data, prescription data, sociodemographic data, clinical trial data from pharmaceutical companies and data from newer technologies and 'omic measurements under appropriate data governance respectful of privacy.
Scope:
The main goal of this initiative is to improve AF, HF, and ACS patient outcomes through better access and use of data. This will require:
1.defining and prioritising relevant patient outcomes in collaboration with key healthcare system stakeholders and patients;
2.accessing and analysing relevant morbidity and mortality data from large population based healthcare databases and patient data sources;
3.collecting and analysing data from clinical studies, genotyping, protein biomarkers, advanced imaging, or quality of life information directly from patients;
4.exploring algorithms that combine traditional and newer sources of data to improve the ability to assess the risk of a patient or population for relevant cardiovascular outcomes, diagnose the subtype and biological drivers of those risks, prescribe effective treatments, and monitor for progression or regression of disease;
5.translating the insights from these analyses to disease management concepts and guidelines, and innovative drug development to improve patient outcomes.
Expected Impact:
The expected impacts of the proposed project are better and safer treatment paradigms for patients with AF, HF, and ACS. This impact should be achieved by providing evidence which will make it easier for HCPs and other stakeholders to provide the right treatment to the right patient at the right time."

Reproducibility and relevance of research findings represent the pillars of the scientific method. For drug development, robust data and scientific rigor are key drivers for decision making, determining patent strength, time-to-market and consequently availability of new treatments to patients. Substantial evidence has accumulated that robustness, rigor and validity of research data can be problematic. While the issues at hand concern all areas of Research & Development, the impact of unreliable data, as well as the potential benefit of intervention, is greatest in areas already facing additional challenges, such as Neuroscience.
Scope:
Starting with a first pilot project focused on Neuroscience and Safety, the goal is to advance the quality and efficiency of Discovery R&D data. This action should provide evidence/data to develop quality criteria for new and/or improved preclinical tests, develop consensus quality management recommendations in non-regulated R&D to enhance the quality of decisions made based on experimental data, and by developing an educational course on data quality as a major contributor to enhance the quality culture in preclinical research. The action should also contribute to the development of a proficiency test system (ring tests) in preclinical research and to the implementation and testing of the quality principles developed by the consortium in day-to-day research settings, both in academia and industry, to achieve maximal cross fertilization and cultural exchange.
Expected Impact:
These efforts can be expected to result in an improvement in the data quality of pre-clinical studies via the delivery of reliable and reproducible models with harmonized and standardized protocols and procedures. There will also be a significant contribution to the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) in the use of experimental animals in preclinical research, to IP protection and regulatory success by ensuring validity and traceability of data.

Efficient and adequate safety assessment remains one of the main challenges in the drug discovery, development and submission process. Recent advances have shown that sharing of public & private pre-clinical data is achievable. In parallel, the electronic CDISC-SEND format has been chosen for file submission to the FDA. This offers the opportunity to generate and exploit a large amount of organised data to allow the in-depth assessment of the preclinical species predictivity to human.
Scope:
The NexGETS project will:
Development of an internationally accepted guideline for data sharing
Accrue large sets of d preclinical and high-level clinical safety data
Conduct a retrospective data analysis to assess translation of preclinical to clinical safety outcomes
Ensure that participating companies have similar or greater access to data as regulators to facilitate discussion
Develop innovative tools for data mining, analysis, data display and prediction
Expected Impact:
The NexGETS project should aim to set world standards and act as the central partner to go to in terms of preclinical data handling, analysis and use for predictive toxicology
This approach will have an impact on the 3Rs

The central challenge to be addressed is to establish and validate non-invasive markers for classifying and evaluating subjects with NAFLD, and in particular to identify amongst those with NAFLD, individuals who have Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Identifying and validating these biomarkers will be crucial in furthering an understanding of the factors that drive the heterogeneity of NAFLD and in enabling accurate diagnosis of those with NASH. The ultimate challenge that will be addressed is to validate one or more NAFLD biomarkers that can serve as surrogates for development of clinically meaningful outcomes.
Scope:
The scope of this proposed biomarker collaborative research for NAFLD and NASH will encompass development of diagnostic and staging biomarkers that can separate NASH from NAFLD, and more specifically, identify the presence and severity of inflammation and fibrosis. This will serve to help identify the most appropriate population for a particular treatment. Secondly, development of biomarkers that can predict progression. It is recognized that in general, NASH progresses slowly toward End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD). However, there do appear to be subgroups that progress fairly rapidly. Accordingly, there is a need to qualify biomarkers that can identify “fast progressors” amongst those who meet criteria for a diagnosis of NASH. Finally, the ultimate goal of this biomarker research is to provide evidence supporting the regulatory acceptance of non-invasive biomarkers as surrogates for clinically important endpoints. It will be a long-term goal of this collaborative research to validate biomarkers that reliably identify and predict risk for cirrhosis and complications of ESLD (e.g. varices, ascites) and that reliably identify and predict risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Expected Impact:
It is expected that this program to identify and qualify non-invasive biomarkers for NAFLD and NASH will be transformative for clinical management of patients and profoundly enabling for drug development for treatment of NASH. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are the twin pillars that support medical practice and the unmet need that is present with regard to NAFLD and NASH cannot be effectively addressed without the elucidation of validated biomarkers."

Infection with Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive spore-forming anaerobe, is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in developed countries and leads to symptoms that range from self-limiting mild-moderate watery diarrhea to severe fulminant diarrhea, abdominal pain and pseudomembranous colitis. In some patients it may progress to toxic megacolon, colonic perforation and death.
Over 500,000 new cases of C. difficile infection occur each year in the US and estimates suggest greater than 400,000 diagnosed CDI events occur annually in Europe, although the true incidence is likely to be much higher. Furthermore, the burden of CDI outside of the acute care hospital environment, particularly in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, is under-estimated.
There is therefore a need to develop a robust assessment of the burden of CDI and current practices in Europe.
Scope:
Development of a detailed understanding of the epidemiology and clinical impact of CDI; more specifically to:
align and understand the unmet public health needs relating to CDI;
identify the direct and long term burden on healthcare systems;

Collaboration and partnership amongst public health institutes, regulatory bodies and vaccine manufacturers is therefore necessary to build a strong platform to perform influenza effectiveness assessments
Scope:
The scope of the action includes the development and validation of a sustainable governance model for the evaluation of type/brand-specific seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness in Europe, through collaboration between public and private partners. Furthermore, the scope of the action is to build an EU/EEA-wide recognised and accepted platform for influenza vaccine effectiveness studies, including the development of tools for communication and dissemination of the results obtained from the studies.

","06 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Amongst the commonalities of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), are bioenergetic failure and oxidative stress, both of which reflect the dysfunction of mitochondria within neural and glial cells. As such, a detailed understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain in the context of ageing, injury by misfolded protein toxicity, and genetic factors associated with neurodegeneration holds much promise for the development of therapeutic interventions that could impact multiple neurodegenerative disease states.
The overall challenge of the topic is to develop an unprecedented appreciation of the evolution of mitochondrial dysfunction in models of PD in order to understand if dysfunction is a driver of disease progression. A key goal is to develop an unprecedented appreciation of mitochondrial function in an in vivo model of neurodegenerative disease, which is currently lacking. Other challenges to be addressed within this topic are to quantitatively dissect changes in mitochondrial function in in vitro and in vivo models (including brain slices) and through mechanistic computational models of PD; and to understand the impact on the degeneration of neurons and/or glia.
There is a growing appreciation of the impact of glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia) in neurodegeneration, so it would be valuable to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction in several cell types. There is also the opportunity to investigate mitochondrial function in neural cells derived from human sources, both from patients and unaffected individuals.
Identification of the key molecular drivers of mitochondrial dysfunctions in the disease models will provide a unique scaffold to enable the discovery and development of new therapeutics to halt neurodegenerative disease progression.
It is anticipated that the topic will lead to the identification of key molecular drivers which will provide a foundation for the identification and validation of new drug targets, facilitating innovative therapeutic approaches within the neurodegeneration field. Moreover, mitochondrial abnormalities serve as a connecting theme between several neurodegenerative diseases, with a direct link to several processes known to be impaired in neurodegeneration such as bioenergetics and misfolded protein toxicity. Therefore, the learnings are anticipated to also feed into the understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunctions in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Scope:
The overall scope of the project generated by this topic is to identify and understand the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction in in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases, incorporating core characteristics of neurodegeneration such as protein misfolding. Understanding if dysfunction is a driver of disease progression, and the detailed mechanisms responsible for it, will enable the exploration of novel targets for therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative diseases.
The scope will be reached by a scientifically robust strategy building on established and innovative PD models, and the appropriate technology experience within the consortium. More specifically, this will include addressing the following objectives:
In vitro
In established and innovative in vitro models of PD in neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes and/or astrocytes, understand the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction (such as respiratory function, biogenesis, trafficking, fission, fusion and mitophagy) on the development/severity of the disease phenotype and identify key molecular drivers of these dysfunctions. Assessment of correlation between morphology and function should be included to ease later interpretation of morphological observations in vivo.
Among others, the in vitro phenotype would ideally include a demonstration of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by α-synuclein or tau in a humanised model system such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which allow the study of both neurons and glia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia) individually, but also in co-cultures to study interactions and cross-talk. These cellular models would then be further developed into a robust model for therapeutic target identification. Models could potentially include organotypic slice cultures including those incorporating prion-like spreading of misfolded proteins. Assessment of correlation between morphology and function should be included to ease later interpretation of morphological observations in vivo.
Neurodegeneration is a phenomenon directly associated with ageing, yet most in vitro cell-based models use neonatal tissues as a source of primary cells. Moreover, iPSCs essentially have their biological clock reset, thus eliminating elements of ageing in the model. Incorporating a component affecting mitochondrial ageing as a model variable would be a valuable addition to the in vitro approach.
In vivo
In a well characterised, robust in vivo PD model, investigate if mitochondrial dysfunction can be identified. Understand the impact of these changes on disease progression such as neuronal and synaptic health, as well as the potential for their therapeutic modulation. While many in vivo models of PD exist, convenient models using transgenic animals already aged before the start of the project or injection of fibrillary forms of disease-associated proteins as a seeding mechanism to trigger neurodegeneration would be the most appropriate. These models typically develop disease pathology over a time frame suitable for the studies proposed here.
In silico
Reconstruct a mechanistic computational model of mitochondrial function to account for the gene products of each gene associated with mitochondria and closely associated organelles. Integrate the experimental data from the in vitro and in vivo experiments to generate control and neurodegenerative computational models. Quantify the relative contribution of abnormal respiratory function, biogenesis, dynamics (axonal transport, fission, fusion), and mitophaghy to mitochondrial dysfunction.
Expected Impact:
Progressive neurodegenerative diseases represent a large and growing burden. Despite a considerable investment in research aimed at understanding and treating neurodegeneration, the lack of disease-modifying therapies remains notable. Recognising this gap, the treatment of neurodegenerative disease is a clearly-identified goal of IMI2 JU, and the expected impact of the project to be generated by this topic is closely aligned with the overall goal.
There is considerable evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of a number of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, but no efficacious treatments have been developed based on this knowledge.
By developing a set of validated cellular assays, organotypic brain slice models and in vivo tools, the project will remove an important barrier that has limited the systematic exploration of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease. A clear identification of the specific mitochondria dysfunctions (such as respiratory function, biogenesis, trafficking, fission, fusion or mitophagy) contributing to neurodegeneration will enable the discovery of novel targets for intervention.
By taking advantage of recent advances in the understanding of mechanisms that control mitochondrial dynamics and using innovative technologies to access mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. axonal transport and fusion/fission in highly relevant model systems), this approach should provide unprecedented insights into the causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
SMEs can be of great benefit to IMI2 JU projects and, inter alia, strengthen the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe. Their involvement might offer a complementary perspective to industry and academia, and help deliver the long-term impact of the project. For these reasons, applicants should consider engaging SMEs throughout the proposal.
The project learnings will strongly aid neurodegenerative disease understanding and the identification of novel targets, giving academics/SMEs/pharmaceutical companies new options for treatments of diseases with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as PD. Moreover it would encourage a renewed investment in developing drugs for neurodegenerative disorders for which there is a high unmet medical need. In particular, biotech SMEs will be able to ‘stress-test’ their technologies in a non-competitive, open innovation environment, which will greatly facilitate the development of novel and important therapeutics.
Thus, it can be anticipated that the results of the project will benefit patients and society through the accelerated discovery of new drugs and therapies for neurodegenerative diseases."

Effective and efficient collaboration and coordination among the IMI portfolio of projects in the area of Neurodegeneration and related national, European and global initiatives is a key success factor for the important public-private investment to achieve its full impact, as also highlighted in a recent meeting hosted in Brussels by the IMI2 JU.
It also is evident that projects share several areas of common interest (e.g. modelling and simulation, imaging) and have developed best practices that would be very useful for other ongoing and upcoming initiatives, but due to the silo-like structure of the individual initiatives, the opportunity for real and effective cross fertilisation is limited and based on the “good will” of enthusiastic individuals. The portfolio of IMI projects has grown significantly and it is diverse in scope and focus, making the need for a more structural and tailor-made support structure mandatory.
Projects would also benefit from support (including access to learnings from other projects) towards the submission of results for regulatory and/or health-technology assessment (HTA) to ensure that important results can timely impact regulatory practice and the health care system. Often the data to support a regulatory/HTA submission are only fully available in the very final phase of the projects or even after their official end which may hamper their submission and subsequent follow up.
A significant challenge in collaboration is the burden required to develop agreements and good practices for sharing and re-use of data, biological tools (e.g. cell lines) and other materials, activities that are normally either not or only minimally resourced under individual initiatives and can be labour intensive and require expertise (e.g. legal, ethical) not always readily available for each project.
All projects face the challenge of sustainability of their results, and the lack of a source of advice and support in finding/choosing relevant solutions beyond the project lifetime.
There is therefore a clear need for support to ensure that collaboration and coordination become intentional and structural to the portfolio of projects in the IMI strategic area of neurodegeneration, by providing the necessary resources and framework.
Last but not least there would be a very high value in having a framework to facilitate collaboration and coordination of the many initiatives focussed on neurodegeneration, in and beyond IMI, and to develop some metrics to show their value in advancing research and remove bottlenecks toward the delivery of innovative treatments to patients.
Scope:
The overall scope of the coordination and support action is to provide the necessary overall framework and resources to achieve effective and efficient coordination and collaboration among the ongoing and future projects in the IMI strategic area of neurodegeneration. This will include:
Develop a framework to coordinate and support the operational alignment of the IMI Neurodegeneration research portfolio, including a process to ensure that projects make appropriate use and can access existing infrastructures;
Provide expert advice and other support to facilitate sharing and access of data, biological tools and other materials among projects;
Provide expert advice and support in preparing for regulatory and/or HTAs interactions (e.g. legal support, access to relevant expertise, funding to pay submission fees) to ensure that appropriate regulatory input is provided when most valuable and also beyond the timeframe of a project;
Establish and manage workshops designed to share common approaches/best practice across IMI projects and beyond;
Develop a framework to coordinate and efficiently support the operational alignment of the IMI led actions with other relevant partnerships and initiatives at national, European and global level
Create a platform to enable the mapping of partnerships and collaborative efforts that have supported over the past years research in Alzheimer’s disease to capture their contributions and identify the remaining gaps and develop metrics and benchmarks to measure value, including socio-economic impact;
Develop outreach and engagement actions with other international/national/regional initiatives including patient organizations to promote and increase the value of trans-national and international research collaborations;
Communicate and disseminate on joint activities and initiatives in the field of neurodegenerative diseases;
Seek alignment and coordination on issues of common interest such as Ethical, Legal and Social Implications of clinical neurodegenerative disease (especially Alzheimer’s disease) research, where several learnings are already available but disperse.

The expected impact would be:
An enhanced impact of the individual projects by creating structural synergy and collaboration;
An enhanced visibility of the significant public and private investment of IMI in the area of Neurodegeneration; To ensure the results of IMI projects are developed optimally for the benefit of patients and the health systems including strategies for sustainability and uptake;

Diabetes contributes to the development of heart failure (HF) indirectly by promoting the progression of coronary artery disease and directly through the development of cardiomyopathy. Thus, diabetic patients have a 2.5-fold greater risk for HF as compared to those without diabetes. Epidemiological studies have reported a 4-fold higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in HF patients (20%) compared to age-matched populations without HF (5%) which rises up to 40% in hospitalised HF patients. Over the last decades it became clear that there is a relationship between diabetes and HF, although not all patients with diabetes develop cardiomyopathy or evolve toward HF.
The overall objective of this topic is to determine whether diabetic cardiomyopathy is unique and distinct from the other forms of heart failure such as HFpEF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) or HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) by performing unbiased statistical clustering analysis from a dense phenotyping of these patient populations.
Furthermore, a better comprehension of the underlying mechanisms and clinical manifestations of diabetic cardiomyopathy will also allow the development of more translatable and predictable preclinical models to support target and drug discovery.
Scope:
The overall goal of the proposed topic is to assess the uniqueness of diabetic cardiomyopathy and to unveil the underlying mechanisms of cardiomyopathy in diabetic patients and the impact on cardio-vascular mortality in this population, which may finally allow the clustering of patients into an independent cohort. In consequence, this improved understanding of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of diabetic cardiomyopathy as well as the linkage between the onset and disease progression with a specific signature will enable patient stratification at an early stage of the disease by clustering of patients into an independent cohort.
Expected Impact:
In terms of research and development (R&D), clinical, regulatory, healthcare practice and patient management:
proposals are expected to define and assess key phenotypes that characterise diabetic cardiomyopathy and could serve to establish patient diagnosis and ultimately prognosis;
the stratification of patients into the diabetic cardiomyopathy cluster based on pheno-mapping, supported by biomarkers specific for this group will be transformative for the clinical management of these patients;
furthermore, novel pre-clinical models with improved knowledge on the translatability to humans will profoundly enable drug development for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy beyond blood glucose control.
Overall, a better comprehension of the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of diabetic cardiomyopathy will allow the development of more translatable and predictable preclinical models supporting target and drug discovery in academia and industry.

","06 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, the EBiSC project (https://www.ebisc.org/) funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU) has demonstrated the feasibility and challenges of coordinating existing organisational capacities across Europe to fast track the establishment of a centralised network and facilities to access a standardised resource of established human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) lines and data. EBiSC has established a unique European-based iPSC repository and has delivered harmonised and publically accessible Standard Operations Procedures (SOPs) for tissue procurement, bio-sample tracking, iPSC expansion, cryopreservation, qualification and distribution to the research community. These were implemented to create a quality managed foundational collection of lines and associated data made available for distribution.
The critical challenge addressed by this topic is to build on these important infrastructure, capabilities and knowledge to create a fully sustainable European hiPSCs distribution platform with worldwide reach.
Scope:
The overall objective of the action generated from this topic is to establish a fully self-sustainable European human iPSC banking facility, that has to be operational within the first three months of the action by seamlessly building on and incorporating existing cell lines, knowledge and infrastructure established within former European-wide initiatives (e.g. EBiSC). The bank has to be able from the start to handle and deliver a minimum of approximately 500 quality-controlled, disease-relevant (in particular for neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, Parkinson’s disease, cardiovascular disease, safety, diabetes, and auto-immune and selected monogenic diseases), research-grade iPSC lines, with integrated data and cell services which will be further built on as part of the research and technology work of the action. The ultimate goal is to transform significant pre-existing European banking infrastructures into a sustainable resource for European research and development.
Expected Impact:
Availability of iPSC lines derived from patients, as well as of a broad spectrum of lines from healthy donors of different ages, standardised according to how they were made and their in vitro behaviour, and the possibility of linking a gene code to cell line phenotype reflective of the disease, will enable the research community to refine original clinical diagnosis into one based on disease stratification and thereby design more precise experiments to discover novel pathogenic pathways, drug targets and new medicines. This is expected to significantly advance research and development activities across Europe by accelerating the progress of understanding certain disease aetiologies, as well as finding potential cures, thereby strengthening European competitiveness.
This European iPSC repository will be uniquely positioned to serve as the central European iPSC repository hub to accelerate and facilitate European research and development activities. Therefore, the consortium will have to continuously monitor the sale of cells produced by the banking entity, and its trend in order to develop in the runtime of the project a plan as to how to transform the repository into a self-sustainable business. Ultimately this will secure that the public and private investment will establish a resource that beyond the runtime of the project continues to support and fuel European basic research as well as drug development campaigns in pharma companies."

","06 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Loss of mobility is a growing unmet medical need, driven by chronic illness and frailty in the elderly and by injury in the young. Loss of mobility is a key morbid effect of diseases of various organ systems, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. New therapeutic approaches target restoration of function and mobility in patients with degenerative diseases, acute injuries, and age-related disabilities, such as muscle anabolic drugs, cartilage regeneration approaches, and other therapies targeting the musculoskeletal system.
However, current primary endpoints that measure mobility are either based on patient reported outcome or performance testing, both of which have significant shortcomings.
To ensure full acceptance and integration of digital mobility assessment into clinical trials and utilisation as primary or secondary endpoint, there is a need for rigorous validation and linkage to clinically relevant ‘hard’ endpoints, such as death, disability, falls, or other complications.
Scope:
The purpose of the action is to measure in three chronically ill or frail populations (e.g. heart failure, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, COPD, frailty/sarcopenia, post-hip fracture):
as a primary outcome, real world walking speed (RWS);
as secondary outcomes, additional digital mobility assessment (step counts, time walking, gait characteristics, time sitting/standing/walking, cadence, estimated energy expenditure of physical activity, etc.) to be collected and compared (or combined) with RWS to identify outcomes of maximum predictive power.
The action will demonstrate that RWS or one of the other gait parameters predicts relevant medical outcomes (falls, injurious falls, hospitalisations, loss of activities of daily living [ADLs], death), and achieve regulatory recognition of RWS as a surrogate endpoint independently of underlying disease diagnosis. To do this, regulatory submission for qualification opinion is anticipated.
Expected Impact:
By making mobility assessment feasible, and indeed an integral part of medical care, this could enable development of novel solutions (pharmacological, digital, nutritional, exercise-based) to a major public health problem – the increasing prevalence of mobility disability due to the aging of the population and chronic diseases. The digital assessment of mobility is such a method, and has the potential to revolutionise the care of frail populations and of the development of drugs to treat them.
Successful demonstration that digitally-detected low mobility predicts relevant clinical outcomes will have major impact on drug development and clinical care of the target population."

","30 November 2017
","06 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Inflammatory skin diseases affect a significant percentage of our global population. Atopic Dermatitis (AD) affects approximately 10% of children and 3% of adults worldwide. Psoriasis (Pso) affects approximately 2% of our population. These diseases remain poorly understood with limited understanding of their mechanism, endotypes, ontology and co-morbidities, affecting the quality of effective treatments. While there may be aspects of these diseases that overlap, others show little or no similarities e.g. their associated co-morbidities are generally quite distinct with Pso being linked with arthritis, psychiatric disorders, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular sequelae while AD is associated with rhinitis, asthma, food allergy as well as cardiovascular complications. As a result, there is an immediate need for sophisticated, in-depth investigations of these diseases that address transformative topics. These studies include, but are not limited to, the impact of environmental factors (e.g. via the microbiome) interacting with genomic factors and studies that help elucidate molecular pathways of disease in a comprehensive, patient-driven manner. To this end, the challenge is seeking to define the key heterogeneous and homogeneous aspects of AD and Pso, both within each disease and across their shared biology. Such characterisation can include clinical hallmarks, patient epidemiology and reported outcomes, and assessment of molecular signatures.. Expanding our current knowledge to understand unique endotypes of inflammatory skin diseases will help give rise to more precise, targeted treatments that can yield long lasting reductions in disease burden and improved patient quality of life, fulfilling unmet medical needs in patient care.
Scope:
The action to be generated from this topic is expected to lead to a step change in our understanding of the molecular mechanism and ontology of the two main inflammatory skin diseases: AD and Pso. Elucidating the molecular pathways of these inflammatory skin conditions over time will give rise to novel and meaningful therapeutic targets for specific patient populations and help address the complex patterns of co-morbidities. In addition, this work will identify biomarkers that will enable robust, efficient and meaningful patient management.
These objectives should be achieved both via a retrospective assessment of Pso and AD patients that can aid in defining key endotypes of disease and the disease commonalities and uniqueness, as well as via access to ongoing prospective studies that will embrace novel approaches and hypotheses relating to defining these. It is expected that reliable access to robustly defined clinical information and specimens will be vital to the overall scope.
Expected Impact:
Currently, Pso and AD represent diseases difficult to treat and they significantly impact quality of life and medical health care costs for patients. This topic aims to comprehensively address aspects of disease endotypes, underlying pathobiology, and factors contributing to initiation, exacerbation and severity of disease, as well as response to therapy. Consequently, there are broad impacts relevant to the IMI2 goals that include:
Research and Development (R&D) Process: using a patient-centred approach through comprehensive characterisation of skin disease heterogeneity, it is expected that new understandings into pathobiological processes will be established that should help drive future therapies, as well as stimulate new levels of understandings into skin biology and how it is regulated during homeostasis, disease, and repair.
Regulatory Pathways and Health Technology Assessment: establishment of comprehensive disease endophenotyping will improve directed care decisions and future clinical trial design, including biomarkers, quality of life considerations, and patient enrolment suitability.
Clinical and healthcare practices: understanding of early life events and environmental influences over disease progression and severity will support improvement in physician recommendations and management of patients.
The topic expected impact is to establish, and support access to, a world-leading analysis of skin disease, as comprehensively addressed from the perspectives of AD and Pso. This should be achieved through studying unprecedented patient numbers, a robust depth of data available (e.g. clinical, transcriptomic, response to treatment etc.), state-of-the-art approaches to studying the disease biology and central accessibility for users of the BioResource.
In terms of strengthening the competitiveness and industrial leadership in Europe impact will be significantly enhanced by also including the relevant expertise from the Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).Their involvement might offer a complementary perspective to industry and the academia, and help deliver the long-term impact of the project."

","06 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Huge amounts of antibiotics are prescribed and consumed unnecessarily in almost all healthcare systems. The misuse of antibiotics has created a huge global health crisis. Prudent use of antibiotics is urgently required in order to protect the efficacy of our currently available antibiotics. Diagnostics have the potential to provide more targeted, accurate use of antibiotics which is in the best interest of patients and the wider population. Diagnostics play a critical role in guiding treatment in infectious diseases. However, the value of diagnostics as a critical component of antimicrobial stewardship programmes is not fully established throughout Europe, with guidelines, funding and policy varying in each country. This hinders the adoption and use of currently available diagnostic tests by health professionals, as well as the development of advanced or innovative diagnostic tools. Therefore, a pan-European approach is required, to demonstrate the medical, economical and public health value of diagnostics for combating AMR.
Scope:
The main objective of this action is to understand, demonstrate, and quantify the value of diagnostics and the obstacles to their adoption and use in the framework of a Standardised Care Network in order to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by optimising antibiotic use in Europe.
The overuse of antibiotics and the underuse of diagnostics occur within the entire breadth of healthcare. It is a major issue especially in the ‘community’ setting (e.g. non-hospital clinics, private physician offices, para-medical clinics) where the majority of human antibiotics are used, most of which are inappropriately and unnecessarily prescribed. It is crucial to demonstrate both the economic and clinical value of diagnostics to health systems and purchasers.
Health economic models for the use of diagnostics must be developed to:
address the costs and benefits of the use of diagnostics and their impact on antibiotic prescribing;
propose funding models (e.g. research incentives, reimbursement framework, adoption motivation) which would facilitate the development, introduction, deployment and use of diagnostics into routine medical care.
A global roadmap must be defined to promote the use and development of diagnostic tools that would have distinct and clearly defined objectives: (i) avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use; (ii) optimising patient treatment and antibiotic use; (iii) identifying high-risk patients and/or pathogens for targeted and personalised antibiotic therapy; (iv) using diagnostics in clinical trials for supporting the development of new anti-infective approaches (prophylactic or therapeutic); (v) boosting innovation for new diagnostic development.
The action aims at providing clinical evidence to demonstrate the medical value, healthcare benefit and economic viability of diagnostic tests for combatting antibiotic resistance and improving patient outcome in conditions such as community-acquired acute respiratory tract infection (CA-ARTI).
Expected Impact:
Expected impact will be the reduction of antibiotic use and AMR resulting in improved patient care through better routine use of diagnostics. This would happen thanks to a raised awareness of health professionals and patients on the necessity to effectively replace empiric antibiotic therapy with targeted therapy when required, particularly for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) with short-term health benefits for patients, short-term economic benefits for the healthcare system, and mid-term / long-term benefits on reducing antibiotic resistance.
The main expected impacts should be: (i) optimum use of diagnostic tests in CA-ARTI for achieving improved patient outcomes, reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and decrease in the incidence of key antibiotic-resistant pathogens; (ii) wide dissemination of evidence-based conclusions that will sensitise the medical and patient communities, as well as decision makers, to the clinical and economic value of diagnostics; (iii) incorporation of guidance using diagnostic tests and testing algorithms in national and international guidelines; (iv) assistance to regulatory bodies to facilitate adoption of diagnostic tests into wider routine practice; (v) assistance to health technology assessment (HTA) bodies to enable appropriate, fit-for-purpose assessment of the clinical value of diagnostics; (vi) reform of pricing policies (including reimbursement) related to diagnostic tests, according to the demonstrated or anticipated medical value and health outcomes.
New health economic models demonstrated through the project will lead to new pan-European guidelines and algorithms to facilitate the widespread introduction, deployment, adoption and reimbursement of existing and new diagnostics to guide appropriate antibiotic use and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. Economic models will illustrate to governments, third-party payers and healthcare providers the economic feasibility and benefits of utilising diagnostics to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing in various healthcare settings."

The AMR Accelerator will provide, under one operational structure, a wide-ranging series of projects that will address many of the scientific challenges in AMR.
TB is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide. The lack of efficiency of current TB drugs is emphasised by the nearly 1.8 million annual deaths reported by World Health Organisation (WHO). Of these, 200 000 were confirmed cases of drug resistant TB, although real estimates could be much higher. As expressed by the United Nations (UN), a massive scale-up and a dynamic, global, multi-sectoral approach is needed if the global target of eradicating tuberculosis by 2030 is to be met. At present, there is a strong consensus both in private and public research sectors working on TB that having a large number of new drug candidates, which are ready to enter into clinical combination studies, is the most critical step to achieving this aspirational goal that will have a tremendous impact on global health.
Scope:
The TB drug development Network (TBDDN), pillar B of the IMI2 AMR Accelerator programme, will function as a platform based on the principles of open innovation to advance discovery, preclinical and early clinical projects in the field of TB and MDR-TB. One of the objectives of the TBDDN is to become a worldwide reference for the development of novel candidates and regimens by sharing results generated by partners and peers from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), public institutions and pharmaceutical companies
Specifically, the scope of this action is to: (1) coordinate, profile and progress the portfolio of anti-TB compounds existing within the industry consortium (EFPIA companies and Associated Partners) from the advanced lead stage through Phase 1 (candidates ready to enter into Ph-2 clinical studies); (2) identify preferred drug partners for preclinical combination studies that will facilitate the design of combination regimens consisting of new TB drugs with an indication for the treatment of any form, including MDR, of TB (pan-TB regimen); (3) create additional tools and technologies to progress anti-TB compounds, and to provide learnings derived from the analysis of shared anti-TB clinical trial data; (4) develop new alternative anti-tubercular drugs (host-defence or virulence approaches); (5) act as an interface with stakeholders in the TB field and explore synergies and collaboration with the action resulting from IMI2 JU Call 15, topic 7 and potential TB-focused actions from IMI2 JU Call 16 as well as other AMR initiatives.

Central nervous system (CNS) disorders are some of the most prevalent, devastating and poorly treated illnesses that impact individuals, families and society. It is estimated that annually in Europe alone, approximately 38 % of the population will suffer from a CNS disorder.
The term ‘synaptopathy’ is typically used to describe CNS disorders caused by synaptic deficits, irrespective of whether the alterations are primary or caused by underlying pathophysiological processes Whilst our emerging understanding of how synapses are pathologically altered in certain brain disorders is leading to innovative opportunities for drug discovery, there are considerable challenges impeding effective research that still remain. Furthermore, the current technologies and platforms employed within early drug discovery are not fully characterised with respect to their predictive translational value, thus leading to a high risk of failure once compounds are progressed into the clinic.
What is desperately needed therefore is the identification and validation of robust, sensitive and translational platforms capable of quantifying synaptic alterations both preclinically and clinically. Such platforms should be fit for purpose to detect and quantify dynamically both disease and treatment effects. Finally, we need to demonstrate the value of these new tools and methods for supporting drug discovery and development efforts across a spectrum of therapeutic CNS indications, including neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.
Scope:
The overarching aim of this topic is to develop an improved understanding of the causative or contributory role of synaptic alterations in CNS disorders, which must be valid and applicable to drug discovery and development across the diverse therapeutic CNS areas. The aim is to construct a precompetitive research consortium focused on furthering our scientific understanding of how synaptopathies can elicit or contribute to brain disorders. In addition, the focus will be to develop and validate both existing and innovative translational tools and platforms to facilitate drug discovery targeting synaptic health.
To achieve the overall aim of the topic, applicants should focus on at least one of the four major brain disorders namely Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, major depression and schizophrenia, and ideally at least two, one in the neurodegenerative and one in the psychiatric/neurodevelopmental field.
Specifically, the effort should be divided into two key areas.
Deep clinical phenotyping of CNS disorder patients to enable the development of robust tools to measure disease and treatment effects on the synapse.
Characterisation of existing and development of novel preclinical synaptopathy disease models
Expected Impact:
The expanded knowledge base generated to define the contribution that synaptopathies play in neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders will lead to improved disease pathway understanding and thus better position academia, SMEs and pharmaceutical companies to identify and validate tractable drug targets. The concerted and aligned efforts will minimise duplication and redundancy. The tools, platforms and technologies will ultimately drive success in both the discovery and clinical arenas by providing robust translatable evidence of early clinical efficacy as compounds are evaluated in patient populations. These achievements will facilitate the delivery of much needed, highly effective medicines and treatments for CNS disorders."

Neurodegenerative movement disorders (NMD) and immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) can cause considerable disability and morbidity in spite of the availability of approved treatments. Recent estimates suggest that neurodegenerative disorders are becoming one of the fastest growing costs for healthcare systems. Movement disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease (PD), affect about 1.2 million European citizens, a number set to double by 2050 While rarer, the burden of Huntington's disease can be up to 5 times higher than that of PD patients.
Digital technology, in particular remote monitoring systems, if properly implemented and validated, could provide a critical help in improving measurements of efficacy by increasing sensitivity and precision, reducing variability, and enhancing their ecological validity making them closer to the actual unmet needs of patients. This project will develop a technology platform to collect and analyse sensor/generated datasets, principally high resolution passively and actively collected digital measurements, i.e. actigraphy, socialisation parameters and momentary self-reported assessments, mainly using (but not limited to) wearables and smartphone sensors and apps.
Scope:
Subtle impairments in accomplishing daily activities are sometimes reported among the first signs of a disorder that will progressively develop towards more severe disabilities for individuals affected with NDD and IMID. Identifying the ADLs that first or more consistently are affected by the disorders and tracing their progression using original digital solution is a key aspect of the present project. In fact, advances in micro-sensors and mobile technologies have the potential to enable seamless, continuous, objective measurements of symptoms and disabilities, providing more precise and higher frequency data collection. The early identification of impairment and the possibility to follow its worsening with precision and reliability are essential tools for assessing the effects of novel treatments that should target the disorder in its early phases. In fact, if the disorders progress beyond a certain point, the disabilities may not be reversible, justifying early interventions.
Expected Impact:
Digital transformation of clinical and real-world measures of ADL / quality of life measures relevant to patients and care-givers will give deeper and more detailed insights into how diseases progress and cause disabilities in patients, which, in turn, will enable development of interventions that better address these clinical deficits and disabilities.
Digital endpoints when combined with patient self-reported outcomes and other traditional clinical measures will provide a more valid and complete assessment of patient and care-giver impact of disease and their treatments.
Digital transformation of clinical and real-world endpoints will enable larger and more inclusive clinical trials and reduce patient burden thus allowing assessment of interventions in more diverse and representative populations.
Use of passive digital technologies will increase the efficiency of clinical trials, enabling faster clinical development and a reduction in the time taken to bring new therapies to patients. These technology enabled endpoints with passive data collection will make larger and longer follow-on studies to assess real world impact of therapies on patients possible, thus enabling more effective value driven health care decision making.
It is expected that, in the long run, this project will enable the development and evaluation of more effective therapies for patients thus improving outcomes for patients and reducing cost for all stakeholders.
Applicants should also demonstrate how they will impact on the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe by, for example, engaging suitable SMEs."

Patient non-adherence to prescribed treatment is an issue that affects patient health outcomes and healthcare system costs worldwide. It is estimated that it contributes to 200 000 premature deaths in the EU each year, and the annual costs of avoidable hospitalisations, emergency care and adult outpatient visits are assessed at EUR 125 billion. Addressing the issues of adherence would significantly improve both individual patient outcomes and reduce societal costs.
Many researchers have approached the topic of adherence but insights have necessarily been limited to specific sub-topics due to the breadth of the field. Unless the underlying problem is well-defined and understood, the probability of developing effective solutions with broad and consistent impact is low.
Consequently, there is a need to generate a more comprehensive theoretical and empirical understanding of the underlying causes of these patient behaviours and any interactions. This topic proposes the creation of a generalised model, grounded in behavioural theory, which integrates significant factors affecting non-adherent behaviour. This would provide a robust definition of the problem – a foundation for understanding and predicting patient behaviour – and guidance to develop and implement cost-effective tools and solutions for patients, healthcare professionals (HCPs) and other healthcare stakeholders, which directly target the causes of non-adherence and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes and reduce health system costs.
Creating the necessary understanding for an effective model will require broad engagement and skills, particularly since we are targeting a disease agnostic model. The perspectives of patients, healthcare providers, academic experts, behavioural scientists, digital and data analytics experts, and regulatory bodies will be essential to maximise the benefits and ensure all sectors of society are well served.
Please refer to Call topic text.
Scope:
The aims of the Call topic are to:
develop a comprehensive understanding of the factors which affect patient needs and adherence, independently from the therapeutic area (i.e. generic or disease-agnostic), in a real-world context (as opposed to clinical setting);
identify the most significant factors;
evaluate existing models and then either create an open access behavioural model or further develop an existing model;
collect additional real-world data to refine the model;
provide tools that will enable healthcare stakeholders to cost-effectively develop and implement solutions to address patient needs and improve adherence rates.
A behavioural model will be created or selected and refined. In parallel, adherence modules will be added to existing patient studies to fill identified gaps in the data.
While disease-agnostic, the model should be able to increase the prediction power and accuracy when applying additional, disease-specific inputs.
Once developed or refined, the model will be validated for multiple ages (including paediatric), ethnicities and conditions. It is anticipated that this shall be achieved using the following therapeutic areas, dependent on access to patients provided by members of the consortium:
Cardiovascular;
Oncology;
Immunology;
Neurology;
Endocrinology and
Rare Disease.
This list is not exhaustive. Where opportunities arise to validate in other additional therapeutic areas, these should be explored.
Please refer to Call topic text.
Expected Impact:
In their proposals, applicants should describe how the outputs of the project will contribute to the following impacts and include wherever possible baselines, targets and metrics to measure impact:
Positive impact on healthcare at a societal level through enhanced adherence, targeted use of resources, and improved overall patient outcomes;
Validated foundation to compile and understand factors affecting patient non-adherence to treatment regimens and the relative weighting of these factors;
Identification of sub-groups of the population with similar causes of non-adherent behaviour such that solutions can be tailored to population needs and applied in a cost-effective manner to multiple treatment conditions;
Model for the basis of a consistent approach to non-adherence across the industry; a framework for future development of patient-centric solutions, with the capacity for the model to evolve with the future needs of patient populations;
Guidance, based on the validated model, for identifying patient needs and tailoring support tools for patients and HCPs which most closely address patient adherence needs and improve patient outcomes and quality of life;
The data collected during the project will provide a broad and deep resource for future understanding of adherence.
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project plans to leverage the public-private partnership model to maximise impact on innovation, research & development, as well as regulatory, clinical and healthcare practices, where relevant. This could include a strategy for engagement with patients, healthcare professional associations, healthcare providers, regulators, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies, payers etc., where relevant.
In addition, applicants should describe how the project will impact the competitiveness and growth of companies including SMEs.
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project will:
Manage research data including use of data standards;
Disseminate, exploit, and sustain the project results. This may involve engaging with suitable biological and medical sciences Research Infrastructures;
Communicate the project activities to relevant target audiences.
It is expected that the model, guidance and any development tools will be made available through an open source process to achieve the aims of maximising the number of patients receiving support.

Deadline date","Scope:
1. Background
This is a call for proposals for information measures based on Article 45 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy.
This call for proposals is also governed by Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union[1].
An information measure is a self-contained and coherent set of information activities organized on the basis of a single budget.
2. Objectives — Themes – Target public
Objectives
The general objective of the call is to build trust within the EU and among all citizens, farmers and non-farmers alike. The common agricultural policy (CAP), is a policy for all the citizens of the EU and the benefits that it provides to them must be clearly demonstrated.
The key issues and messaging should be fully consistent with the Commission’s legal requirement to carry out information measures on the CAP within the meaning of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. The proposals submitted shall provide coherent, objective and comprehensive information, both inside and outside the Union, in order to give an accurate overall picture of the CAP.
The focus should be on addressing misperceptions and disinformation about European agriculture and the CAP using facts and backed up with data with a view to raising public awareness on the relevance of EU support to agriculture and rural development through the CAP.
Themes
The proposals for information measures shall illustrate how the CAP should continue contributing towards the delivery of the Commission’s political priorities.
The Common Agricultural Policy is one of the EU's most important policies. It is a partnership between agriculture and society and between Europe and its farmers. It is a common policy for all the countries of the EU. The CAP has a number of aims such as supporting farmers and improving agricultural production, maintaining rural areas and landscapes, keeping the rural economy alive and helping tackle climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources.
Having regard to those aims and, particularly, to the ever-increasing focus on the sustainability of agriculture, the proposals for information measures should address specifically this topic focusing on the economic, environmental and social dimensions of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Target public
The target public for the themes is the general public (in particular young people in urban areas) and/or farmers and other parties active in rural areas. The focus of information on the CAP would put greater emphasis on addressing the (mis-) perceptions of European agriculture, the role of farming in society and the need for greater understanding of the enormous contribution the EU agri-food sector provides to the wider EU economy.
More specifically:
For school children, teachers and university students: novel approaches should be used to engage with young people and raise their awareness of the CAP and the contribution that it makes in many areas such as the climate change challenge, food, healthy and high quality eating as a lifestyle choice, in relation also with the EU School Scheme for Milk, Fruit and Vegetables[2] and Tartu Call[3].
For stakeholders: it should be ensured that there is greater awareness of the contribution that the CAP makes to the support of sustainability of agriculture.

Research Infrastructures such as the ones on the ESFRI roadmap and others, are characterised by the very significant data volumes they generate and handle. These data are of interest to thousands of researchers across scientific disciplines and to other potential users via Open Access policies. Effective data preservation and open access for immediate and future sharing and re-use is a fundamental component of today’s research infrastructures and Horizon 2020 actions. In this context, European research stakeholders make increasing use of cloud services to effectively handle such data.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is the launch of a pilot action that should demonstrate how wide availability of scientific data and data-analysis services for European researchers can be ensured through a cloud infrastructure.
Proposals should address the federation, networking and coordination of existing research infrastructures and scientific clouds for the purpose of increasing data findability, accessibility and interoperability, improving the services provided to research communities, and facilitating re-use of data by a wider user community. Trust, easy accessibility and use by researchers should be duly taken into account. Particular attention should be paid to storage, access and re-use needs for data and knowledge from Horizon 2020 projects, as well as to the needs of the ‘long tail of science’, including orphaned scientific communities.
The action should build on existing infrastructures and design a stakeholder driven governance framework, with the involvement of the research user community, the research infrastructures and the research funding bodies to ensure its sustainability. Links with related national and European initiatives should be established. Links should also be established with projects selected under topic EINFRA-12-2017, to collaborate, exploit potential synergies and ensure complementarity.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 10 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Facilitate access of researchers across all scientific disciplines to the broadest possible set of data and to other resources needed for data driven science to flourish.
Provide a governance and business model that sets the rules for the use of data, deals with issues related to privacy, sensitivity, copyright and security and oversees the provision of services (business and governance layer).
Create a cross-border and multi-disciplinary open innovation environment for research data, knowledge and services with engaged stakeholders and organisations.

The transition from construction to full operation of a new pan-European research infrastructure, can be slowed down by the difficulties to align the funding cycles of the different countries committed to contribute to its implementation. A significant EU contribution to support the preparation for full operation could trigger the alignment and accelerate the research infrastructure transition from the implementation to full operational phase and enhance its sustainability.
Scope:
This topic aims to accelerate the implementation and initial operation (start-up phase) of the Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) project. This ESFRI project is the best example of the synergetic use of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), Horizon 2020 support and national funding for the construction and deployment of a research infrastructure. The Horizon 2020 support should complement investments coming from ESIF in order to expand the scope and impact of both funds in terms of scientific excellence and regional socio-economic development.
The support should foster the transformation of ELI from a construction project to a fully operational European user facility and the participation of all interested countries in the establishment of a legal entity in charge of the operation of ELI, which will most likely take the form of an European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). Proposals would have to demonstrate the involvement of the three ELI pillars and at least the other four ELI-DC (Delivery Consortium) members as well as the relations with other relevant laser initiatives in Europe, and should cover at least the following dimensions:
Joint ramping-up of the operation of ELI, realistically compatible with the users’ demands and with the related operational resources.
Further definition of service level agreements and business/funding plans supporting a joint sustainable cost model based on an operational staffing optimisation.
Joint development of associated services that should be used by scientists and industries and of a user base together with associated expected revenues for ensuring sustainable operations after the 'start-up' phase.
Development of joint activities and mutual exchanges with relevant laser initiatives.
Enlargement of the ELI membership.
Limited pilots of access provision for testing and improving user services to increase reliability and create trust.
Outreach and technology transfer activities.
Proposals should explain any synergies and complementarities with previous or current EU grants.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 20 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This activity will:
contribute to providing Europe with a comprehensive landscape of sustainable Research Infrastructures helping to respond to challenges in science, industry and society;
strengthen the ERA position and role in the global research environment;
reinforce the partnership between the Commission, Member States, Associated Countries and relevant stakeholders in establishing pan-European research infrastructures and in successfully operating them;
enable researchers to address societal challenges with a global dimension;
foster capacity-building and Research Infrastructure human capital development in targeted/relevant regions.
ensure that the socio-economic impact of investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Supporting Centres of Excellence (CoE) that advance and promote the use of upcoming exascale computing capabilities in areas where user communities in collaboration with other High Performance Computer (HPC) stakeholders can develop or scale up existing parallel codes towards exascale performance, resulting into tangible benefits for scientific, industrial or societal challenges.
CoEs must be user-driven and inherently committed to co-design activities to ensure that future HPC architectures are well suited for the applications and their users (both from academia and industry), providing with a high performance and scalable application base. CoEs will federate existing resources around Europe, exploiting available competences, and ensuring multidisciplinarity (combining application domain and HPC system, software and algorithm expertise) and synergies with national/regional programmes. CoEs must further enlarge and expand these capabilities all over in Europe, in particular by including users communities from EU countries currently developing and advancing their HPC infrastructure and ecosystem (e.g. countries not currently hosting Tier 0 and/or Tier 1 supercomputing facilities).
This topic builds and complements the INFRAEDI-02-2018 HPC PPP - Centres of Excellence on HPC applications call.
Scope:
Proposals should clearly identify the target area/domain that will be the focus of their work, which must have great potential to achieve exascale performance in Europe, (e.g. Materials Science, Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Personalised Medicine, etc.). Proposals must convincingly demonstrate this potential and the need for exascale requirements. Proposals must also develop synergies with existing CoEs and show European added value. Should the proposed work target an area or domain already covered by existing CoEs, proposals must clearly elaborate on how their proposal further expands and develops progress beyond what existing CoEs are implementing (e.g. different/new codes upgraded, new user communities, etc.) and demonstrate that they shall cooperate with existing CoEs (if relevant) and avoid any kind of overlaps/duplication in the selected area of work.
Proposals must address:
Research in HPC applications towards highly scalable, optimised codes and the path to exascale performance (both computing and extreme data)
The provision of services supporting different usage models for the community needs, and contributing to the potential convergence of HPC, High Throughput Computing (HTC), and HPDA (High-Performance Data Analytics). This includes developing, maintaining, optimising (if needed re-designing) and scaling HPC application codes, addressing the full scientific/industrial workflow, particularly covering data aspects; testing and validating codes and quality assurance
Commitment to the co-design approach (hardware, software, codes), including the identification of suitable applications relevant to the development of European HPC technologies towards exascale
Enlarging and expanding HPC applications development and use, in particular for new users communities in EU countries currently developing and advancing their HPC infrastructure and ecosystem
Ensure wider access to codes and foster their uptake by user communities, in particular industry and SMEs
In collaboration with the support action foreseen in the INFRAEDI-02-2018 HPC PPP - Centres of Excellence on HPC call, address the skills gap in computational science in the targeted domain by specialised training and capacity building measures to develop the human capital resources for increased adoption of advanced HPC in industry and academia
Proposals must include clear KPIs allowing the assessment of the progress towards the objectives, both in terms of outputs and ultimate impact.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a duration from 24 to 36 months would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
European leadership in exascale-oriented codes and innovative algorithms/solutions that address societal challenges or are important for key scientific and industrial applications;
Improved access to computing applications and expertise that enables researchers and industry to be more productive, leading to scientific excellence and economic and social benefit;
Increased access to and uptake of applications by relevant user communities in those countries currently developing and advancing their HPC infrastructure and ecosystem;
Improved competitiveness for European companies and SMEs;

","Research and Innovation action
","05 December 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To achieve excellence in their research activities, researchers need to use a broad range of state-of-the-art services that sometimes are not made available by their public e-infrastructure facilities, either because not offered by them or because they are developed more efficiently by commercial operators. The challenge is to set-up a legal and technical mechanism to integrate these supplementary commercial services into the EOSC hub in order to make them available to the scientists.
Scope:
The action will cover the following activities:
research activities for understanding how various needs from researchers can be aggregated and the complementary commercial services required to maximise the impact of the tools already available in the EOSC catalogue of services which enable inter-disciplinary research;
technical integration of the complementary commercial services into the EOSC catalogue of services, including management of the access rights and establishment of appropriate legal agreements (contracts, service level agreements, etc.) that are necessary to make accessible the commercial services to the EOSC users; due consideration should be given to the use of open standards and interoperability of the services;
provision of access to the services through the EOSC catalogue of services.
Proposals will address the availability of both types of services listed below:
a) Commodity type commercial digital services that are necessary for interdisciplinary research activities including, but not limited to, e.g. cloud services (storage, computing, and applications), software licenses, simulation tools, collaboration and virtualization tools.
b) A wide variety of secure Earth Observation commercial services[1]. Proposals should address commercial services stemming from the use of Copernicus open data accessible through the 'DIAS' platforms and its smart integration into the service catalogue of the EOSC. These commercial services may include other space or non-space inputs.
The proposals should include:
1) an outline of the methods to be used for gathering specifications and requirements from scientists/users that would properly reflect the user-focused perspective of the EOSC;
2) the proposed criteria for the selection of the most relevant commercial services addressing the needs discussed under point (1) above, that can generate positive impact on research activities;
3) the proposed indicators for continuous monitoring of the quality of the service taking into account the feed-back received from the users as well as appropriate criteria for ensuring broad usage of the services.
4) a clear description of how the interoperability and use of open standards will be taken into account during the project execution.
These services will have to be integrated in the EOSC via procurement. A specific target of this action is the development of a value-added capability for procuring and brokering commercial services for the EOSC. Public e-Infrastructures should act as aggregators of demand for such commercial services and provide access to the acquired resources through the EOSC hub for the benefit of the scientific community. The commercial services targeted by this action should complement the service offering of the EOSC catalogue of services. In order to limit the costs of integration into the EOSC catalogue of services, the action should focus on commercial services that are compliant with any available standards and guidelines set for the management of the EOSC services. The access mechanisms to the services proposed in this topic should be based on pan-European identity management and authentication services, aligned with those used in the EOSC framework and build on the experience and outcomes provided by the AARC project and its continuation, AARC2.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 11 and 12 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. A balanced allocation of the budget between the above two types of commercial services is expected (50% each). Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Set-up a value-added procurement mechanism for commercial services that creates economies of scale in procuring and brokering resources for the EOSC and helps optimising investments enabling long-term sustainability for the EOSC;
Enable the creation of new market opportunities and new solutions by facilitating cross-fertilisation of heterogeneous data and services;
Lower access barriers for scientific community to commercial services, including DIAS-supported added value services and enhance industry’s potential to take advantage of scientific market opportunities.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
Open Science
[1]Copernicus is the Union Earth observation and monitoring programme. In this context, the Commission is setting up for Copernicus consolidated Data Access and Information Services (DIAS) platforms primarily addressing open data and other components from the EO Community that will eventually lead to (data-related) EO commercial services. The commercial services based on DIAS would become available to the scientific community also through the EOSC."

","16 October 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Develop an agile, fit-for-purpose and sustainable service offering accessible through the EOSC hub that can satisfy the evolving needs of the scientific community by stimulating the design and prototyping of novel innovative digital services. Innovative models of collaboration that genuinely include incentive mechanisms for a user oriented open science approach should be considered.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions that target gaps in the service offering of the EOSC hub and develop innovative services that address relevant aspects of the research data cycle (from inception to publication, curation, preservation and reuse), for example allowing implementation of new scientific data-related developments and intelligent linking and discovering of all research artefacts.
Whereas initially the new services would have to respond to specific needs of particular scientific communities by the end of the project they should be leveraged to foster interdisciplinary research, serving a wider remit of research needs, as well as new users like industry and the public sector. Scalability of the new solution should be tested by user communities from different disciplines during the project lifetime. These services should be based on systems and technologies that have reached TRL 6 before the start of the project and will be brought to at least TRL 8 by the end of the project. Proposals should demonstrate how the resulting services complement, enrich and could potentially be integrated into the EOSC hub. Proposals retained for funding under this topic should take due consideration of any accessibility requirements set under the projects funded under EINFRA-12-2017 topic that may be available at the time the call will be open, in view of their integration into the mainstream services of the EOSC hub.
Consortia are encouraged to include SMEs that are willing to develop or contribute to the development of new innovative interdisciplinary services with a view of future integration in the EOSC hub.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 6 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Integrating co-design into research and development of new services to better support scientific, industrial and societal applications benefiting from a strong user orientation;
Supporting the objectives of Open Science by improving access to content and resources, and facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations;
Fostering the innovation potential by opening up the EOSC ecosystem of e-infrastructure service providers to new innovative actors.

","Research and Innovation action
","19 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The phase of integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure platforms initiated under the Research Infrastructures Work Programme 2016-2017 (in particular, through the EOSC-hub) as well as the work carried out by other EU funded projects and initiatives[1], has set the ground for the development of the EOSC Portal. Through its main components, the EOSC website, catalogue of services and marketplace[2], researchers and other users can find and use research-enabling services and resources, get technical support, integrated solutions from the EOSC providers, participate in co-design, and be informed about and engaged with, the EOSC vision and policy initiatives.
Building on this work, the challenge is now to consolidate and scale up the EOSC Portal and its underlying service platform in order to: 1) strengthen the EOSC Portal so that it continues to provide an increasing portfolio of high quality standard compliant and interoperable services of proven user interest and scientific relevance from a wide range of national, regional and institutional public research infrastructures in Europe as well as from commercial service providers in its catalogue; 2) reinforce the role of the marketplace as the access channel to integrated, composable and reliable services; 3) attract more users, within the research community and beyond, by enhancing the user experience and seamlessly accommodating their needs; and 4) ensure its long-term sustainability taking into account all the relevant governance and business frameworks.
Scope:
Building on the outcomes of the projects awarded under topics EINFRA-12-2017[3], INFRAEOSC-06-2019 (a), INFRAEOSC-05-2018 (a), INFRAEOSC-04-2018 and other relevant EU funded projects and initiatives[4] (including the thematic clouds), proposals should address the following activities all together:
a. Operation, maintenance and enhancement of the EOSC Portal (the website, the catalogue of services and the marketplace)
Enhance operational aspects of the EOSC Portal: proposals should include tools and activities to ensure the basic functionalities underpinning the portal, such as the support, quality, security, reliability and traceability of services, effective monitoring of usage and evaluation of performance, messaging and usage accounting. A user-friendly interface, offering integrated information on the EOSC vision and process, should be also ensured, encouraging constant learning and alignment in all disciplines and Member States.
Engage with the supply side of EOSC: proposals should provide a framework to interact with all service and resources providers[5], in order to ensure that their services are integrated into the catalogue of services and, where appropriate, the marketplace. They should also ensure the alignment of the providers with future EOSC principles, standards and values including compliance with the Rules for Participation and FAIR principles[6] and the reduction of the complexity barrier to users. Consortia should address issues related to the adoption of common standards by all suppliers, the implementation of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the automatic collection and exchange of information related to service updates, the mechanisms for reporting usage, the support for virtual access accounting mechanisms[7], etc.
Interact with the EOSC end users and provide a highly usable service platform: proposals should foresee the necessary feedback mechanisms (including a user panel) and user behaviours’ analysis within the EOSC Portal environment to allow for constant improvement of the features of the different EOSC Portal components and their usability easing the way users can interact and evaluate the service. The analysis should include gender sensitive issues, when relevant. Proposals should also put in place the necessary mechanisms to elicit users’ needs requiring new services (including commercial ones).
b. Fostering and enabling secure service composability
To allow for a higher level of service integration within the EOSC marketplace, proposals should take due consideration of the need for secure composition of services and resources from different providers. Researchers and other EOSC end users should be able to discover services and combine them to compose new, more complex services, tailored to their specific needs. By enabling EOSC users to compose reliable, secure and scalable services, the EOSC marketplace will become more flexible and adaptable, maximising its impact and benefit for the research community.
In this context, proposals should provide a framework, including specific pilot scenarios, for exposing, integrating and managing a wide-range of standard and policy compliant cross-domain and domain-specific research enabling services and resources from pan-European horizontal and thematic research infrastructures as well as from commercial providers. In particular, they should:
Allow for user friendly discovery, access and re-use of major public research outputs (e.g. publications or datasets) and data processing capabilities, analytical tools or any other added-value quality service from various providers;
Provide and evolve service management tools that support the provider’s participation to the EOSC federation;
Foster secure composability of services and interoperability of datasets and other outputs by supporting the use of common interfaces, standards, ICT specifications and best practices that not only allows for services to be reused in multiple service compositions but also ensures the reliability, flexibility and scalability of those services.
c. User enhanced experience using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques
Proposals should describe how the EOSC Portal would be enhanced with AI-based services in order to exploit usage patterns and to advise researchers and other EOSC users on the most suitable EOSC services according to their research profiles and needs. In this way, researchers that have completed their EOSC user profile (including their affiliation, research interests and needs) can get suggestions based on what services other EOSC users with similar interests and access rights have used to address their research needs. The advice will have to be continuously updated, based on the actual activity of the users at the EOSC Portal enhancing quality and improving predictive response to cover evolving needs and ensure engagement. The quality of the advice of such AI-based services should improve with the increase of the number of EOSC users and services available.
d. Widening the EOSC user base
Proposals should include strategies and well-defined structures for gathering needs from potential new user communities and propose methods outlining the operational requirements to be satisfied by the EOSC Portal to effectively attract and integrate new users. This includes the possibility of federating and/or integrating heterogeneous and hybrid research clouds into the EOSC Portal.
In order to enable users from non-research communities to access EOSC services through the EOSC Portal, the AAI[8] federated architecture implemented in the EOSC Portal should be fully aligned with the legal and interoperability framework set by the eIDAS Regulation[9].
Proposals shall include the development of APIs or any other necessary feature that allow third parties such as Open Data Initiatives or other initiatives under the European Common Data Space to become users of the EOSC services and to access the available services in the EOSC Portal from their own environments.
Proposals should include an outline of the legal, technical and business processes to be implemented through contractual agreements between the EOSC Portal and user institutions that are interested in providing increased accessibility to EOSC services and resources to their affiliated members.
e. Widening the service offer with commercial services
Proposals should address both of the following activities:
Proposals should incorporate commercial services into the EOSC marketplace and expand it, by building further on the work carried out under the topic INFRAEOSC-01-2018[10] and under the EOSC-hub project. In particular, proposals should (1) through the EOSC Portal feedback mechanisms[11], aggregate the various needs of EOSC users for commercial services that are complementary to the services offered by public infrastructures, (2) procure preferably green[12] innovative commercial services addressing the aggregated user demand and (3) make available the purchased services to EOSC users. Proposals will make the procured capacity available for access - together with other capabilities of interest - through the portal access channel. Service capacity shall be allocated to projects and initiatives through a selection process that ensures excellence, fair distribution across scientific communities and removal of digital divides across communities and countries. The procurement mechanism should be compatible with the Green Public Procurement initiative[13]. Examples of commercial services that could be incorporated include commodity type commercial digital services that are necessary for interdisciplinary research activities or secure Earth Observation commercial services stemming from the use of Copernicus open data, etc. The inclusion of such added-value commercial services will enrich the existing catalogue, generate positive impact on cross-disciplinary research activities in the EOSC environment and improve user experience with the overall EOSC service offering. A maximum amount of EUR 10 million of the total budget for this sub-topic is foreseen for this procurement activity.
Building on the work of the EOSC-hub project, proposals should collaborate with private sector entities, in particular with SMEs, in the context of digital innovation hubs initiatives, in order to stimulate an ecosystem of innovation and knowledge transfer that fosters the development of commercial services to continuously cover the needs of EOSC users[11].
f. Support activities
Proposals shall also cover all the following activities aiming at boosting the impact and outreach of the EOSC Portal:
i. Outreach and skills
Leveraging on existing networks and actions for training on and outreach of the EOSC and in strong collaboration with the awarded grants under topic INFRAEOSC-07-2020, proposals should include activities to:
Foster the EOSC initiative’s uptake and spread both geographically and across scientific disciplines and communities (including long tail of science). Moreover, proposals should include measures and dissemination activities for closing the gap between European countries with higher and lower EOSC uptake, including the EU candidate countries and the Western Balkans.
Develop the necessary skills of EOSC users for sharing resources, managing data and applying the FAIR principles in the context of the EOSC Portal, by e.g. providing researchers and data practitioners with consolidated cross-infrastructure training packages for data skills, data science and data stewardship.
ii. Support to the Research Data Alliance’s contribution to the EOSC:
Proposals retained for funding should directly support the contribution of RDA to the EOSC initiative and, in particular, in the context of the EOSC Portal.
Proposals should also provide financial support to third parties wishing to engage and participate in the Research Data Alliance processes and activities, including RDA outputs adoption fostering the interoperability and service composition in the EOSC Portal[15].
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to the actions awarded under topic INFRAEOSC-07-2020. The main purpose of the collaboration agreements referred to in Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement is to describe the terms and conditions for the provision of services through the EOSC Portal.
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to the action awarded under topic INFRAEOSC-06-2019 (a) and should conclude a collaboration agreement.
For grants awarded under this topic, beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming at ensuring exploitation of its results: proposals must necessary state the participants’ commitment to: a) use open source software, b) make tools, standards, specifications and all other relevant outputs generated in the action available, through a well-defined mechanism, to the EOSC governance and any other institution responsible for the continuity of the EOSC Portal beyond the lifespan of the Grant Agreement.
Grants awarded under this topic are expected to carry out an analysis regarding energy consumption and environmental impact of technologies used in the context of the project. The analysis should include an action plan in order to limit the carbon and energy footprint with a specific reference to the standard EN 50600-4[16] together with a timeline for implementation of the defined milestones and KPIs.
As the scope of this activity is to consolidate a single EOSC Portal, at most one single proposal covering all the described activities (a. to f. included) is expected to be funded.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 40.9 million and a 30 months duration would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts and durations.
Expected Impact:
Provide pan-European access to state-of-the-art secure, interoperable and scalable EOSC services and resources enabling the emergence of genuine Open Science, enhancing data skills and boosting data intensive research in Europe.
Enable researchers and other users to compose secure and scalable services that respond to actual and evolving needs, in a secure, flexible and scalable environment.
Build an agile EOSC and increase the uptake of its services by public and private sectors stakeholders, across Europe, exploiting solutions and technologies for the benefit of all areas of economy and society.
Reduce the burden for research organisations and other service users to engage in complex procurement processes, support cross-analysis of data from heterogeneous sources and create market opportunities for innovative research data services.
Increase the overall value of open research data and ensure that EOSC contributes to the global playing field of open FAIR data.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Following the recent communication of the Commission on International Cooperation in Research and Innovation[1], the research infrastructures activity will focus on a number of key third countries seen as strategic for the development, exploitation and management of world-class research infrastructures. The G8+O5 countries plus Australia, singularly or in their entirety, for the purposes of the Group of Senior Officials (GSO) on Global Research Infrastructures, are also included, without excluding the possibility of cooperation with other interested third countries or regional bodies.
Scope: In this context, the research infrastructure action will focus its activities on international cooperation in three different but complementary ways, as required: bilaterally with a single third country at policy level; multi-laterally with different third countries, targeting specific research and innovation aspects of research infrastructures of common interest in one area of science and technology; multi-laterally with different third countries if a specific effort is required in the context of a specific world class research infrastructure. Support to activities decided in the context of the Group of Senior officials on Global Research Infrastructures may fall in the latter two categories.
Proposals will address one of the following areas:
         Facilitate the development of global research infrastructures and the cooperation of European Research Infrastructures with their non-European counterparts, ensuring their global interoperability and reach, and to pursue international agreements on the reciprocal use, openness or co-financing of infrastructures, on the basis of the recommendations of the Group of Senior Officials on Global Research Infrastructures;
         Support bilateral cooperation on research infrastructures with Africa. The proposal will build on the past experience and achievements gained in the Seventh Framework Programme project PAERIP (Promoting African – European Research Infrastructure Partnerships).
         Support bilateral cooperation on research infrastructures with Russia. The proposal will in particular help develop cooperation between European research infrastructures and the Russian Megascience facilities[2], including the underpinning e-infrastructure.
         Support multi-lateral cooperation with European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries and Western Balkan Countries. The proposal will aim at developing regional roadmaps of research infrastructures jointly with stakeholders and policymakers and help them develop closer cooperation with research infrastructures of pan-European interest through training, data management and trans-national access.
         Support multi-lateral cooperation on research infrastructures in one or several of the following areas: Arctic research, marine science, biodiversity, food research and medicine. Particular emphasis will be made on cooperation with USA, Canada (including for implementing the Transatlantic Research Alliance, launched by the Galway Statement on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation) and Russia, without excluding other relevant countries such as Australia and New Zealand.
The proposals supporting bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation with research infrastructures in third countries should in particular:
         Identify and promote opportunities (access and data sharing) available to European scientists in these research infrastructures;
         Help developing better coordination and cooperation of European research infrastructures with their non-European counterparts; ensuring their global interoperability and reach, and to pursue international agreements on the reciprocal use, openness or co-financing of infrastructures;
Exchange good practices between user communities and managers of research infrastructures as regard for instance benchmarking performance of technology platforms, harmonisation of tests, standards, reference materials, interoperability and data handling.
Expected impact:
This activity will help to:
         Develop cooperation with key international partners for research infrastructures;
         Contribute to the development of a competitive high performance ERA in the global research environment;
         Reinforce partnership between the Commission, the Member States and relevant stakeholders in this field;
         Enhance the role of the Union in international organisations and multilateral fora;
         Support progress towards the development of global research infrastructures;
         Contribute to address societal challenges with a global dimension such as climate change;

Specific challenge: Facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs for research infrastructures with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of the Research Infrastructures Part.
Scope: Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the area of research infrastructures. The activities will be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to this Part as well as to gender dimension of Research and Innovation, and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries. The focus throughout should be on issues specific to research infrastructures, and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Science with and for Society’. In particular attention should be given to the promotion of trans-national and virtual access, the synergies with other NCPs networks, and the cooperation with other policy and international cooperation oriented measures for research infrastructures. The proposal should build on the past experience and achievements gained in the Seventh Framework Programme EuroRis-Net+ project.
Only NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries, European Neighbourhood Policy countries (ENP), African countries, Australia, Canada, Russia and USA, which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities, are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action. The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be  eligible for funding by the Commission.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with ENP countries.
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this heading.
Expected impact: 
         Improved and professionalised NCP service across the EU, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
         A more consistent level of NCP support services across the EU.

","07 September 2017","Specific Challenge:
To develop new cross-sectoral industrial value chains across the EU, by building upon the innovation potential of SMEs. The EU needs to support the development of emerging industries, which will provide the growth and employment of the future. The reindustrialisation of the EU's industrial base has to focus on the development of long-term internationally competitive goods and services that require combining different competences and innovative solutions. The development of new industrial value chains calls for the collaboration and integration of different innovation actors, including large enterprises and especially SMEs, across different sectors towards the implementation of a joint vision.
SMEs need help to generate, take up and better capitalise on all forms of knowledge, creativity, craftsmanship and innovation – including for the application of existing cross-cutting or emerging technologies, advanced manufacturing, ICT, eco-innovative and resource-efficient solutions, new business models, service innovation and design. The potential of clusters – that represent favourable ecosystems for innovation and entrepreneurship – need to be better exploited in this respect.
Scope:
Cross-border and cross-sectoral collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship across different regions and value chains shall be promoted. The coordination and facilitation shall be led by cluster organisations and other intermediary organisations, by following a systemic approach that combines different resources, tools and instruments. Innovation actors, especially SMEs with mutually reinforcing competences, shall be supported in view of creating new industrial value chains that foster the development of emerging industries in Europe.
To this end, proposals shall outline a strategic vision for building new industrial value chains across the EU Member States and Associated Countries. They shall specifically focus on integrating and supporting groups of SMEs in collaboration with other innovation actors in addressing specific problems and challenges. Cluster organisations or other SME intermediaries shall be invited to set up collaboration and networking activities for SMEs and create a favourable ""open space"" for cross-sectoral fertilisation and value chain innovation to take place. Each proposal should demonstrate the capacity to:
1) validate ideas for structured innovation projects driven by SMEs from different sectors and countries in collaboration with other innovation actors and facilitate the coordination towards new industrial value chains through this collaboration space.
2) support innovation activities and/or channel a mix of different targeted entrepreneurial and innovation support measures (such as mentoring, coaching, innovation and technical assistance vouchers, etc.) directly to the innovation actors of the validated innovation projects to further support their development, integration and large-scale demonstration in a strategic manner. At least 75% of the total proposed budget shall be allocated to support innovation in SMEs directly, whereby the SMEs benefit by either participating in the consortium or by being supported as third party enterprises.
Background information on the systemic approach and strategic focus to be envisaged is provided to applicants.[1] Synergies with the European Structural and Investment Funds that may further support such large-scale demonstration projects will also be actively encouraged, notably through the engaged SME intermediaries. “Large-scale” does not necessarily refer to the amount of financial support provided for a particular project but to the extent of the roll-out of a staged process of experimentation and implementation with accompanying support that reaches out to groups of mutually reinforcing SMEs. This approach aims at “demonstrating at large scale” the potential impact of innovative solutions to specific challenges, rather than supporting isolated projects or SMEs.
For the first stage of the submission procedure, applicants should provide a concept note (of max. 10 pages), which should include a clear description of the ideas and objectives for an innovation action towards the development of new industrial value chains as well as an explanation of the main activities, implementation modalities (including for financial support to third parties, if applicable) and expected results foreseen. The concept note should further describe how the proposed systemic approach and strategic focus promises significant impact on economic growth and job; demonstrates a European dimension and added value; and has the potential to act as a catalyst by contributing to and/or leveraging other activities supported, for instance, under the European Structural and Investment Funds, e.g. in the context of smart specialisation strategies.
An estimate of the total costs of the proposed action and contribution to be requested from the Commission shall also be provided. Only proposals that pass the evaluation threshold for the first stage will be invited to a second stage of submission for a full proposal with a detailed description of the budget and activities planned to be undertaken.
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.5 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provisions of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
Strengthen industrial leadership in the EU Member States and Associated Countries by reinforcing value chains that integrate innovative solutions in SMEs, along and across existing value chains.
Stimulate the creation of new globally competitive industrial value chains across the EU Member States and Associated Countries to accelerate the development of emerging industries, which will boost industrial competitiveness and underpin future economic growth, jobs, and progress towards a resource-efficient economy.
Further leverage and complement support for innovation in SMEs and other funding, which may be provided by national or regional authorities (including under the European Structural and Investment Funds) and/or by private investors (upfront or as follow-up investments), including in relation to the European Fund for Strategic Investments, Knowledge and Innovation Communities, European Technology Platforms, European Innovation Partnerships etc.
Contribute to regional smart specialisation strategies by capitalising upon concentrated and complementary competences for the development of new industrial value chains and emerging industries with a clear EU added-value.
Provide a clear and measurable contribution to the innovation performance of the supported SMEs in the short-term – as revealed by indicators such as numbers of new or significantly improved products (goods and/or services), processes, new marketing methods, or new organisational methods –, and to its impact on resource efficiency and/or turnover. A wider impact is also expected in the medium-term.
Improve the business environment of the supported SMEs by establishing open collaboration spaces that can involve innovation actors from different sectors and countries. This will lead to the creation of new ideas for innovation and new collaboration partnerships, which will be subject of further development and with the potential for further impact on business turnover.

","11 February 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The lack of access to skills, to latest knowledge and capacity to manage innovation processes effectively, have been identified as major barriers for innovation in SMEs. Individual SMEs are at a disadvantage to recruit specialised knowledge as they do not have the network Europe-wide and do not have as well-known brands as large enterprises. Enterprise-led mobility programmes, supporting enterprises in recruiting expertise, show a high level of satisfaction and return on investment. As this methodology is not currently used at European level, an enterprise-led approach is to be developed and tested through a pilot. This complements Marie Skłodowska Curie actions (MSCA) which focus on developing research careers, by providing additional work opportunities for experienced researchers in innovating SMEs.
Scope:
This SME-led pilot is an innovation capacity building action to provide at European level a grant to visionary[1] SMEs which have experienced difficulty in recruiting the relevant skills nationally. SMEs are supported to employ a highly-skilled experienced researcher e.g an 'associate' for one year from September 2017. With their associate, these SMEs will explore for one year the potential of their innovative idea and turn it into an innovation project.
The action will consist of:
SMEs are encouraged to publish a vacancy notice for highly specialised skills on the EURAXESS portal and other relevant platforms and media. This shall liaise them with interested specialist and be used to assess the attractiveness of the proposed package and help in fine-tuning their application to the pilot. SMEs would indicate in the vacancy notice their intention to apply for support under the pilot action[2] and an eventual conditionality of the job offer to the award of a grant. SMEs are free to recruit immediately interested specialists; this would however prevent them from receiving a grant under the pilot action.
The evaluation will focus on the demonstrated benefits of recruiting transnationally i.e. the impact for the SME to get access to skills not available on the national labour market; the excellence and impact of the innovative idea, as well as the coherence and effectiveness of the recruitment plan.
Once awarded the grant, successful SMEs will be able to advertise their vacancy on EURAXESS and other relevant platforms and media, with clear indication that the pilot grant was awarded..
SMEs will employ for 12 months an associate to identify the potential of their innovation idea and turn it, or not, into a research or innovation project and hopefully further employment.
During these 12 months of employment, every associate is requested to participate in a core training programme on industrial innovation and business management[3]. Also during that period, SMEs get financial support to implement a training and development plan specifically for the associate, tailored to the needs of the associate and the enterprise to make the associate fully operational in the company.
In line with the orientation of the action and with the aim to accelerate the integration of the associate in the company's staff, the following costs shall be eligible for reimbursement under the grant: personnel costs of the associate and cost directly related to company's and the associates participation in the pilot action: in particular relocation costs of the associate, travel subsistence costs to the core training programme and costs, including travel and subsistence) for tailored training (as described in the personal development plan). Other costs like recruitment costs or travel costs to action specific workshops by the supervisor in the enterprise would have to be covered under indirect costs.
It is intended to support up to 90 assignments from the indicative budget.
The following criteria will have to be met by the associate: i) PhD holder, ii) an expertise in line with the job advertisement; iii) transnational mobility as defined in the mobility rule of the Marie Slodowska Curie Actions (MSCA). [4]
The execution of the action will start on the starting date of the associates' employment, in September 2017 (exact date to be determined during the grant preparation phase). In case of non-execution, the Commission reserves the right to terminate the grant agreement according to article 50.3.1.l.ii of the General mono-beneficiary grant agreement for the Horizon 2020 programme.
The associates are expected to be offered employment contracts or equivalent by the hosting SMEs. It is expected that the 'associate' will commit him/herself for a full-time position, for the full duration of the grant.
To promote the pilot, innovating SMEs experiencing skills shortages will be contacted by the Enterprise Europe Network innovation consultants and assisted in formulating a vacancy notice to address the identified skills' shortages.
An accompanying study[5] will evaluate the impact of the pilot action and the satisfaction levels of awarded SMEs and associates as well as of a sample of non-awarded SMEs.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrate that
An idea can be transformed into an innovation strategy and a subsequent research and innovation projects once SMEs have access to the right skills;
Public intervention at European level, can support innovating SMEs to overcome challenges in accessing scarce skills through a transnational mobility mechanism, increase their innovation potential;
Experienced researchers develop appealing career opportunities in SMEs

This action is a continuation of the pilot action, which is part of the Innovation in SMEs work programme 2016-2017. The first ""innovation associates"" supported by the 2016-2017 pilot started working in SMEs as of September 2017 onwards. The detailed provisions and the conditions of the action in 2019-2020 are therefore subject to revision based on the conclusions from the first pilot, including also the findings of the accompanying study to INNOSUP-02-2016 that is conducted in parallel to INNOSUP-02-2016.
Scope:
This SME-led pilot is an innovation capacity building action to provide a grant at European level to visionary[1] SMEs that can demonstrate that the skills required for a particular innovation idea are not within reach for them at national level (for example because the required skills are not available or not affordable for SMEs). SMEs are supported to employ a highly skilled experienced researcher (referred to as an 'innovation associate') for a continuous period of one year. The innovation associate's task will be to explore, during the course of his/her contract, the potential of their innovative idea and turn it into an innovation project.
The evaluation of proposals will focus on the demonstrated benefits of recruiting transnationally i.e. the impact for the SME to get access to skills not available on the national labour market; the excellence and impact of the innovative idea, as well as the coherence and effectiveness of the recruitment plan, which should offer the same opportunities for male/female candidates.
SMEs that will receive a grant will be obliged to advertise their vacancy on EURAXESS, unless a contract with an innovation associate has already been signed in line with the provisions above. They are also encouraged to publish the vacancy notice on any other relevant platform or media, with a clear indication that the grant was awarded.
SMEs that are awarded a grant are obliged to employ an ""innovation associate"" for a continuous period of one year[2]. The innovation associate's tasks shall be to identify the potential of the company's innovation idea with the objective and turn it into an innovation project and - hopefully - a continuation of the employment of the innovation associate. During the period covered by the grant, the Innovation Associate must work exclusively on the project described in the grant agreement.
During these 12 months of employment, every associate is requested to participate in a core training programme on industrial innovation and business management[3]. Also during that period, SMEs get financial support to implement a training and development plan specifically for the associate, tailored to the needs of the associate and the enterprise to make the associate fully operational in the company. Proposals shall outline how the proposed tailored training contributes to this end and why it is necessary within the context of the innovation idea and the tasks of the innovation associate.
In line with the orientation of the action and with the aim to accelerate the integration of the associate in the company's staff, the following costs shall be eligible for reimbursement under the grant:
Personnel costs of the associate.
Relocation costs of the associate, which may include removal cost, travel cost of the associate and his/her immediate family (if applicable) to the new place of employment, visa cost (if applicable), translation cost of certificates (if applicable), a temporary transition allowance to cover extra costs upon arrival in the place of employment, cost for the relocation in the country of origin after the project, as well as other clearly justified expenditure directly related to relocation.
Travel and subsistence costs of the associate to the core training programme and travel and subsistence for tailored training (as described in the personal development plan). Travel cost and subsistence for the supervisor may be eligible for up to two training sessions.
Travel and subsistence cost for the innovation associate and the supervisor in the enterprise to one kick-off meeting in Brussels (one day), organised by the European Commission[4].
External cost for the tailored training of the associate (for example course fees or other cost required to implement the training and development plan). Activities that fall under normal induction training[5] for any new employee in a company will not be eligible under this call.
Personnel cost may include allowances that are in line with the beneficiary’s standard practices (for example child education or housing allowances).
Other costs like recruitment costs, equipment costs or travel costs to action-specific workshops by the supervisor in the enterprise are covered by the flat rate indirect cost.
Any cost not directly related to the employment and training of the innovation associate - for example cost of research, dissemination or promotion activities and other cost relating to the actual implementation of the innovation idea/project - are not eligible under this call.
For the call in 2020, please note that this topic will take the form of lump sums as defined in Commission Decision C(2017)7151 of 27 October 2017[6]. Details of the lump sum funding pilot scheme are published on the Funding & Tenders Portal[7] together with the specific Model Grant Agreement for Lump Sums[8] applicable.
It is intended to support an indicative total number of 80-100 assignments from the indicative budget. These will be spread over two cut-offs, one for projects starting in 2019 and one for projects starting in 2020.
The following criteria will have to be met by the associate: i) PhD holder (or equivalent), ii) an expertise in line with the job requirements as outlined in the vacancy notice; iii) compliance with transnational mobility criteria as defined in the mobility rule of the Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions (MSCA)[9].
SMEs having been awarded a grant for this action at the occasion of previous calls for the European SME innovation associate pilot under the work programmes 2016-2017 and 2018-2020, are not eligible.
The preferred start date of the innovation associates' employment is in September of the year following the call opening in order to align the timing of the action with the academic year. The execution of the action will start on the starting date of the associates' employment (exact date to be determined during the grant preparation phase).
In case of non-execution, the Commission reserves the right to terminate the grant agreement according to the provisions of the General mono-beneficiary grant agreement for the Horizon 2020 programme.
The innovation associates are expected to be offered employment contracts or equivalent by the hosting SMEs. In return, the innovation associates must commit to a full-time position, for the full duration of the grant.
Expected Impact:
Test that an innovative idea can feed into an innovation strategy and can lead to subsequent research and innovation projects once SMEs have access to the right skills;
Test that public intervention at European level can support innovating SMEs to overcome challenges in accessing scarce skills through a transnational mobility mechanism;
Increased innovation capacity for SMEs, including increased participation in R&I projects and staff employed in R&I;
Increased awareness as well as skills of researchers in innovation management and business environment, through the placement and training.

The lack of access to skills, to latest knowledge and capacity to manage innovation processes effectively, have been identified as major barriers for innovation in SMEs. Individual SMEs are at a disadvantage to recruit specialised knowledge as they often lack Europe-wide networking connections and do not tend to have established brands as large enterprises.

","Coordination and support action
","08 November 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Foresight studies show that the massive integration of advanced manufacturing will displace in a few years many of the current traditional manufacturing processes. In particular, energy and resource-efficient and low carbon technologies and the circular economy will be key drivers of innovation in SMEs. To remain competitive, manufacturing SMEs will increasingly need to rely on advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production. These technologies enable the development of new production processes, but also improve the manufacturing of existing products by reducing production costs, the reliance on raw materials and the consumption of energy, while diminishing the adverse impacts on the environment by reducing the generation of waste and pollution.
Currently, only one third of manufacturing companies in the EU has used advanced manufacturing technologies so far and plans to use them in the next year[1]. The challenge is to provide technology support to SMEs who lack resources and/or competences to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production.
SMEs' access to technology services and facilities remains difficult in many regions of the EU (a recent inventory shows that two thirds of the technology infrastructures providing services to SMEs in the field of advanced manufacturing are located in only four Member States[2]). In this context, the High Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) recommended in its report of June 2015 to ensure pan-European access of manufacturing companies to ""premier-class"" technology infrastructures in the field of KETs. As a first step, the Commission has published an inventory of existing technology infrastructures in the EU capable of providing SMEs with technology services and facilities in the field of KETs[3].
Scope:
In order to ensure cross-border access of manufacturing SMEs to technology services and/or facilities enabling them to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production into their production process, the action will consist of all the elements listed below:
Establish one-stop shop access for SMEs to technology services and/or facilities from a network of technology infrastructures in the field of advanced manufacturing for clean production.
The technology infrastructures should have the capacity to deliver services such as prototyping, testing, pilot production, engineering, training as well as expertise and advice (in technology but also on the overall innovation process) in order to assist SMEs to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production into their production processes. The service provided to the SME should be driven by its business needs and the implementation should be flexible and fast to cope with the pace of innovation and the SME requirements. The consortium will define capacity and quality criteria and the network should be open to all technology infrastructures able to deliver services in compliance with these criteria. Criteria for monitoring the quality and impact of the services provided to the SMEs should also be established.
Proposals should outline how the network will develop a common coherent methodology to support SMEs in integrating innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production into their production process, including how to reach out to SMEs across Europe.
Proposers are encouraged to link to existing or emerging regional and national networks in the field of advanced manufacturing for clean production, in particular in the context of smart specialisation.
Using the established network with one-stop shop access, provide cross-border services to a critical mass of manufacturing SMEs, over a period of maximum 3 years, to enable them to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production into their production process and make informed decision for further investment. The services should bring together all relevant actors and the experts necessary to enable SMEs to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies into their production process and assist them in customising and applying these solutions in their respective environments.
The action is expected to include financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. The third parties are expected to be SMEs willing to integrate cutting-edge advanced manufacturing technologies into their production process in an innovative way which requires the purchase of a technology service and/or access to specific technology facilities. The consortium will define the criteria for selecting the proposals submitted by the SMEs (such as expected substantial improvement of the environmental performance, innovativeness, expected significant competitive advantage) as well as the criteria for identifying the technology infrastructures capable of providing the necessary services to the SMEs. The consortium will also define the process to select the best offer from the technology infrastructures within the network to provide the required services at the best value for money for each proposal submitted by SMEs. Grants awarded to third parties shall be provided as a lump sum not exceeding EUR 60,000 and should not cover the full cost of the service provided to the SMEs.
Activities and measures to achieve the long-term sustainability of the scheme, including governance and dissemination. This includes the development of a business plan. Collaboration with national and regional authorities in charge of innovation support programmes is encouraged.
Proposals should cover advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production from a circular economy perspective. This can include advanced manufacturing technologies allowing reduced energy, materials and water consumption, reduced waste generation and emissions, the use and re-use of recovered and recycled materials, biomass and/or other renewable inputs, the making of modular products and easier disassembly and separation, as well as process control technologies.
Proposers are encouraged to link with ongoing activities in relevant Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) such as the Sustainable Process Industry (SPIRE)[4] and the Factories of the Future (FoF)[5] and their stakeholders.
Proposers are encouraged to liaise with the Enterprise Europe Network, and cluster organisations, in particular for dissemination activities and identification of the. manufacturing SMEs having a big potential and willingness to adopt innovative advanced manufacturing solutions for clean production.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4.9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Attract a significant number of new SMEs users of innovative advanced manufacturing technologies in the manufacturing sector, leading to significant and quantifiable increase in their productivity, environmental performance and/or in market shares due to increased quality and innovativeness of products;
Creation of a self-sustainable ecosystem gathering technology infrastructures, SME users and suppliers of innovative advanced manufacturing technologies, and providing access to technology services and facilities through a marketplace, covering a large number of regions and their smart specialisation;
Deployment of a critical mass of innovative solutions to apply advanced manufacturing technologies into the production processes of SMEs.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) enable parties who are geographically distant or have no particular trust in each other to interact and exchange value and information on a peer-to-peer basis with fewer to non-existent central intermediaries. Beyond well-known applications in the financial sector, new developments are emerging in other fields. The broader potential of DLTs to change how businesses operate at industrial and market levels for instance, in particular how they produce and deliver goods and services, is swiftly becoming a tangible reality.
DLTs' ground-breaking properties allow immutable, near-tamper proof, decentralized and real time mechanisms for enabling, storing and securing nearly any type of data-based transaction or process. DLTs provide opportunities in terms of communication, efficiency, security, reliability and transparency, such as helping to reduce fraud and counterfeiting, lowering operational costs, enhancing safety and efficiency of transactions, or automating digital manufacturing operations.
Some applications are already being developed in the fields of B2C (business to consumer) and B2B (business to business), where they are illustrating the potential of radical organizational shifts towards more collaborative and automated processes. But, at the same time, such deployments within these and other business or industrial fields are also presenting a number of challenges which may impede the uptake of DLTs by SMEs, ranging from interoperability, standards and intellectual property to liability, data protection, algorithmic accountability and reliability of automated systems.
Scope:
The Action will be a piloting scheme for the uptake of DLTs by SMEs. It will aim at testing in real conditions the opportunities, challenges, risks and necessary conditions associated with DLTs in different context and sectors. Thereby it will stimulate (i) the uptake of DLTs by SMEs and inspire others to follow, and equally (ii) it will sensitize intermediaries to develop their expertise in this respect and (iii) it will help draw lessons for policy makers and regulators.
It will include and make use of financial support to third parties to allow for 20-30 SMEs to test concrete applications of DLTs in their respective field with technology suppliers (budget for each third party not exceeding EUR 50,000). The selection of entities involved in the pilots, the match-making process, the monitoring of each case as well as the management of the financial support to third parties will be ensured by the coordinator. At least 50% of the total proposed budget shall be allocated to financial support to third parties (please refer to the grant conditions for this topic).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
More SMEs take advantage of the opportunities offered by DLTs.
More intermediaries are familiar with DLTs and equipped to assist SMEs in this field.
Improved framework conditions for the uptake of DLTs and the mitigation of related risks."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Workplace innovations are non-technological innovations related to business structure and organisation, employee engagement and Human Resources management, managing internal process and decision making, development and planning of organisational strategies and methods, relationships with clients and suppliers, the work environment itself.
Workplace innovations improve motivation and working conditions for employees, both men and women, which leads to increased labour productivity, innovation capability, market resilience, and overall business competitiveness. Workplace innovation helps companies to anticipate and adapt faster and better to changing economic environment. This type of flexibility is even more important in the context of a new industrial revolution and quickly changing technologies and business models. Being able to react to changes rapidly requires continuous feedback from customers and users. Employees working at the customer interface have an important role in producing this information. Workplace innovation also improves learning capabilities and diffusion of knowledge, which are important for keeping workers' skills up-to-date. Finally, non-technological innovations are an integral part of the successful implementation of technological innovations.
Despite obvious benefits still not many companies, especially SMEs, implement this type of innovation. Implementing workplace innovation and facing challenges related to new industrial revolution requires right managerial skills. That is often not the case for SMEs, which do not have enough knowledge resources.
The experience of the 2013-2016 European Workplace Innovation Network pilot project shows the difficulties in promoting one specific model of workplace innovation. Successful implementation of this type of innovation depends on the national, economic and cultural context (related e.g. to the entrepreneurship and managerial culture).
Scope:
The Action will be a piloting scheme for the uptake of workplace innovation by SMEs. It will aim at creating interregional networks gathering national or regional innovation support agencies[1], which will work together to create pilot schemes supporting the uptake of workplace innovation in SMEs. The composition of the networks should reflect similar needs of SMEs and a comparable entrepreneurship culture in the area covered by the network. This approach will enable the creation of new, context-based workplace innovation support schemes.
Those new pilot schemes will be tested in companies selected by the interregional networks, by using financial support to third parties (at least 75% of the grant will be used for this purpose). The total number of supported companies will be taken into account in the evaluation of the proposals (please refer to the grant conditions for this topic).
The Action, by looking at existing tools, exchange of best practice and creation of new pilot schemes will help to create new, context based, long term mechanisms supporting the uptake of workplace innovation by SMEs across Europe. It will also give concrete support to SMEs interested in looking for new sources of growth through the competitive edge provided by workplace innovation related opportunities. Thereby it will stimulate: (i) new forms of work organisation and working (including the gender dimension); (ii) stronger employee participation in innovation processes (creation of new products, services and their production); (iii) improvement of the managerial techniques; (iv) it will help draw lessons for innovation support agencies.
A budget of EUR 1,5 million should allow to address this challenge (budget for a single network not exceeding EUR 300,000).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 0,3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
New, context based mechanisms supporting uptake of workplace innovation by SMEs.
More SMEs take advantage of the opportunities offered by workplace innovation.
New, context-based forms of workplace innovation are created.
Improved framework conditions for the uptake of new technologies.
Better skilled workforce and more resilient companies.

The PRO-INNO Europe 'INNO-Partnering Forum' (IPF, 2009-2012) has made some significant contributions to formulating the requirements for a permanent learning mechanism for SME innovation support agencies[2]: learning activities have to be based on clear methodologies and they have to be demand driven, launched at the moment agencies themselves recognise the need to revise programme formats. Furthermore peer learning activities need to benefit from a secretariat or an animation structure that assures horizontal flow of information among interested agencies. In a collaborative exercise the IPF has developed two methodologies in this respect: a quality management system implemented through a peer review system based on the EFQM methodology and a 'twinning+' methodology that combines elements of traditional peer reviews and twinning in small learning groups of interested agencies.
It is the objective of this action to make available to national and regional innovation agencies these two methodologies as elements of a permanent peer learning environment and to give incentives to the agencies to engage more frequently in peer learning activities.

Facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs focused on the Horizon 2020 specific objective ""Innovation in SMEs"" and ""Access to Risk Finance"" – including those established in countries associated with Horizon 2020 and interested third countries – with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of the research and innovation-driven SME community, and complementarity with other support entities and networks, for instance the Enterprise Europe Network.
Scope:
Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the areas of ""Innovation in SMEs"" and ""Access to Risk Finance"", and support to SMEs in Horizon 2020 at large. The activities should be tailored according to the nature of the areas, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, and specific training sessions linked to Access to Risk Finance, Innovation in SMEs and SMEs in Horizon 2020. Special attention should be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to ""Innovation in SMEs"" and ""Access to Risk Finance"" and supporting SMEs in optimising participation to Horizon 2020, while ensuring complementarity with activities of other NCP networks and the Enterprise Europe Network in the domain of SME support. The project should promote coordination with other NCP thematic networks, in particular in relation to the NCP network project for quality standards and horizontal issues. The proposal should show how this will be achieved.
Only NCPs who have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, participation of NCPs from third countries is welcome.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs. Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic, for an initial duration of 30 months.
Expected Impact:
An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe and in connection with the rest of the world.

","13 November 2018","Specific Challenge:
Innovation support agencies, i.e. the regional and national agencies that design and/or implement innovation support programmes for SMEs are important intermediaries for SME innovation. Focus, design and delivery mechanism of innovation support programmes determine to a large extent the economic impact from the supported actions and the satisfaction of the beneficiaries with the support provided.
With new business models and technologies emerging, it is more important than ever that innovation support agencies constantly adapt and innovate in the way that they provide support. Yet, innovation support agencies rarely engage in policy experimentation - for lack of funds, time pressure to deliver new support, and the fear of a backlash against 'money wasting'.
At the same time, there is a linked problem that evidence on the effectiveness of both existing and proposed new support mechanisms is limited and inconclusive[1]. Schemes are continued or introduced with no adequate way of testing their effectiveness. However, there is evidence that SMEs benefitting from support programmes are often dissatisfied with the services received[2].
These two linked issues need to be addressed: growing pressure on public budgets demands that the support schemes become more innovative, effective, efficient, and evidence-based and that scarce resources are allocated to schemes with the greatest impact.
These two issues can be addressed jointly by combining policy experimentation and innovation with the introduction of a more evidence-based approach to the support schemes provided by innovation support agencies, i.e. rigorously measuring the impact of interventions using randomised control trials (RCTs) - a method successfully used in other fields most notably medicine. This would encourage them to experiment more, reconcile 'trial and error' attitude with existing expertise, to design and pilot innovative support schemes for new challenges, and scale-up the most successful ones.
Scope:
To incentivise innovation agencies to engage more in policy experimentation and to use RCTs to evaluate the impact of their schemes, and to encourage ""innovating the innovation support system"" through brand new schemes or significantly improved ones[3], the European Commission proposes two types of grants to innovation agencies which wish to innovate their innovation support schemes addressed at SMEs and start-ups. Both types of grants should include testing using RCTs. Financial support to third parties as a direct support to SMEs is possible if required for RCTs (please refer to the grant conditions for this topic).
Strand 1: Grants for small-scale experimental pilot projects which aim to investigate, including small-scale RCTs, either a feasibility of a promising idea for a brand new SME innovation support scheme ('proof of concept'), or test different options of significantly revising an existing support scheme. Funding for grants awarded under this topic will take the form of a fixed lump sum of EUR 60.000[4].
Strand 2: Grants for large-scale experimental pilot projects which aim to test on a larger scale, with RCTs, new SME innovation support schemes. The Commission is looking for proposals to test promising scalable innovative new schemes in support of innovation in SMEs to provide clear evidence of their impact. Proposals requesting a grant of around €300.000 - €500.000 should allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Given the budget involved, a pre-condition to get funding under this strand (unlike under strand 1) would be that the schemes to be tested had either been piloted at a small-scale first or a feasibility study had been done (or both).
Since 2014, the action ""Peer learning of innovation agencies"" (""INNOSUP-5"") has supported national and regional innovation agencies to engage in peer learning on all topics relevant for improving design and delivery of innovation support programmes for SMEs using 'Twinning+' methodology. A deliverable is a Design Option Paper (DOP) on the challenge investigated. Beneficiaries of INNOSUP-5 may apply to this call to test the ideas described in DOP.
Only innovation agencies may apply (including applications from single innovation agencies). For the purpose of this call an 'innovation agency' is defined as an entity entrusted by national or regional government to develop/or implement innovation support programmes for SMEs.
For the first stage of the call applicants should provide a concept note (of max. 5 pages), which should include: a clear description of the idea, including a rationale and expected impact of a new/improved SME innovation support scheme, what makes it innovative compared to existing schemes, and information about the applicant(s). In addition, proposals for Strand 2 should include preliminary budget and evidence that the scheme in question had either been piloted at a small-scale or undergone a feasibility study. This may be evidenced by supporting documents for example on the pilot outcomes or feasibility study results.
Only proposals which pass the evaluation threshold for the first stage will be invited to a second stage to submit a full proposal including timeline, CVs of the project and research teams, and full budget. Moreover, all the applicants should include a letter of intent signed by the president of the applicant innovation agency or its governing authority indicating intent to scaling up the scheme to be tested, if proven successful.
Considering that the use of RCTs in innovation support is not a common practice, a background note with information on RCTs will be made available on the call page at the Participant Portal under ""Topic conditions & documents"". Moreover, an event or webinar will be organised for the applicants invited to submit stage 2 proposals to explain how RTCs could be organised.
The beneficiaries of the action will be assisted from the onset of their projects by a contractor in design and running of RCTs (see Other action 7 'Support to design and running of randomized controlled trials under INNOSUP-06-2018').
Given that one of the objectives of the action is to make new or improved support schemes available to the innovation support, beneficiaries are requested to make the results of the pilot projects publically available.
Expected Impact:
The number of innovation agencies engaged in policy experimentation significantly increases.
Use of RCTs in design and testing of innovation support schemes significantly increases.
A broad range of new or significantly improved SME innovation support schemes are investigated and developed and their impact rigorously tested. Pilot agencies scale up these new schemes.
[1]For example, 2013 ""Compendium of Evidence on the Effectiveness of Innovation Policy Intervention Project"" by Manchester University; or What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth's analysis of around 1700 innovation support evaluations from the UK and OECD countries discovered that only 3% credibly investigated what would have happened to the beneficiaries without the intervention, for example by using the control group. And only a miniscule number of 0.3% found that the impact of an intervention under evaluation had been positive.
[2]See for example “Making public support for innovation in the EU more effective”, Commission staff working document SEC(2009)1197
[3]A ""new scheme"" means ""new to the world"", not just new to the applicant agency; ""significantly improved"" refers to adapting an existing scheme – either making more effective a scheme already in place in the agency, or adapting to local specificities a scheme successfully used in another country.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Creating a higher societal impact from innovation support requires increasing its efficiency. In the recent past innovation support agencies recognised that successful innovation is not originating only from scientific research and technological development, but from new business models, the uptake of technologies, design and organisational changes. Furthermore 'internationalisation’ of business activities is seen as a case of business innovation in some countries.
A better understanding of business innovation opportunities led to an even broader array of innovation support measures put in place for SMEs. But the question arose how to better identify and target those SMEs that can create highest impact from the specific support measures; and how to offer viable alternatives to those enterprises not yet ready to implement the most ambitious projects. Representatives from innovation agencies were describing this process of matching design and delivery of support schemes to the needs, potentials and ambition of their client SMEs as ‘segmentation of the client base’.
Processes of value creation from innovation differ between industrial sectors. For example between capital intensive - but low-speed – innovation in the mining industry; the high speed innovation software development for example for gaming which is realised in networks; pharmaceutical industry with a dominant role of patents and industries with long and complex supply chains like automotive or aerospace.
Many regions try to identify potential high-growth SMEs and orient their support towards realising their full growth potential, yet the methodologies to identify high potentials vary substantially and innovation support programmes put in place are hardly designed taking account of the economic fabric or of the smart specialisation priorities of the region. Instead often a standard portfolio of innovation support measures is put in place.
Scope:
The above describes three interwoven aspects of a challenge to segment the (SME-) clients of public innovation support in order to achieve a higher societal return from the investments into innovation support. The action shall contribute to documenting and analysing existing and potential new approaches to provide innovation support in a more effective and efficient way. Successfully segmenting 'innovating SMEs' – the clients of innovation agencies – is a key in that respect.
To address the described gaps proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:
Develop methodologies to identify segments within the group of innovating SMEs (including SMEs that are not yet innovating but have innovation potential or need) and describe portfolios of innovation support measures that typically address well their needs along innovation cycles. To that end the proposed project should rely on existing datasets (Community Innovation Survey [CIS] or others) or conduct own targeted surveys.
Analyse existing approaches to segment innovating SMEs and analyse existing portfolios of innovation support measures in how far they respond to the needs of important segments in the region.
Analyse in how far popular innovation support instruments like tax credits, vouchers, grants are biased towards certain innovating SMEs or provide opportunities to overcome existing biases.
Projects to be supported are encouraged to conduct specific communication activities targeting the relevant associations of regional development agencies and innovation support agencies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.30 and 1.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The result of the research action shall strengthen the capacity of national and regional ministries, innovation agencies and providers of innovation support, such as cluster organisations, science and technology parks or development agencies, to:
better understand the patterns of innovation opportunities and activities in different segments of the SMEs according to age, size, business activity, industry sector, organisational features and other relevant aspects;
better understand the impact of specific types of innovation support with low entry requirements on different segments of the SME population – of particular interest in this context are tax credits for RDI expenditure, voucher and small grant schemes to strengthen management capacity and technology uptake;
target existing measures better to those SMEs that can create highest economic and societal impact;
design new measures for specific segments of the SMEs to start or diversify innovation activities which create highest impact for their competiveness."

The Long Term Investment Working Group set up by DG Research and Innovation of the European Commission during the Greek Presidency of the Council Conference that took place in Athens on 12 and 13 June 2014 has shown that the lack or dispersion of available data on innovation, of existing analysis of their market potential, as well as the expensive costs to access to both of them, are strong obstacles to assess the technological and financial viability of innovative projects and enterprises for investors.
The Horizon 2020 InnovFin Advisory report on ""Access-to-finance conditions for KETs companies""[1] published and discussed on 31 March 2016 in Den Haag during the ""Innovative Enterprise – Financing Ideas from Europe"" conference of the Dutch Presidency of the Council, confirmed this outcome and allowed to understand more in depth the difficulties faced by innovative SME while attempting to access finance. The report shows the difficulty of the decision making for investors when confronted to high growth potential innovative companies, especially those led by disruptive market-creating innovation. Indeed, enhanced technology and market expertise is needed but not always available to assess the technological viability of projects. Complex technology and ""asymmetric knowledge"" between the companies and lenders/investors worsen the general risk aversion of the latters. Indeed as shown by Nobel Price Akerloff, asymmetries leading to a single price equilibrium mixing different qualities dynamically converge to a market collapse. The transaction cost related to the technological assessment is relatively higher for smaller funding needs. As a consequence Innovative SMEs, and in particular those providing/driving breakthrough/disruptive market-creating innovation, struggle to access to finance.
Scope:
A core solution to improve access to risk finance for innovative enterprises should target these informational asymmetries at their source to help investors decision making by signalling positively technologically rigorous and promising projects, and avoiding a mixed equilibrium between non-viable and viable projects leading to higher interest rate and to the migration of very promising projects outside the EU. Hence, such a solution would lower the risk premium as well as the administrative cost for technological assessment that are ultimately paid by innovative project managers, and therefore should reduce the cost of financing for innovative project managers. Such tool could help improving EU Access to Finance conditions for innovators by better selecting projects, making a better allocation of resources, and a better use of EU private existing fundings by channelling them to companies in position to succeed in their projects, therefore participating to the creation of growth and jobs. Such tool could also help improving the reputation of investing in EU and AC innovative companies by increasing the success probability of such investments which could ultimately lead to attract new investors in the field.
The action will therefore consist of:
The design and development of (a) methodolog(y)(ies) and relating tool(s) providing (a) technological assessment(s) / rating(s) of technologies (being) developed / carried out by EU and AC [2] innovative SMEs seeking for investments for their growth, the methodology should account of the diversity of the strengthes and weaknesses of EU and AC SMEs (supply chain, collaterals, IP, sectorial positioning...);
The testing of the above-mentioned technological assessment / rating methodolog(y)(ies) and relating tools with different group of investors (e.g. business angels, VC, banks (including promotional banks); …). The testing must also target different type of EU and AC innovative SMEs;
The development of a deployment plan of the above-mentioned methodolog(y)(ies) / tool(s).
The action, of an expected length of 3 years, could involve, if relevant, participants from third countries.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Reduction of the financial risks perception and higher confidence/trust for investors supporting EU and AC innovative SMEs;
Easier access to finance for EU and AC innovative SMEs, in particular those providing / driving breakthrough/disruptive market-creating innovation;
Increased investments in EU and AC innovative SMEs, in particular those providing / driving breakthrough/disruptive market-creating innovation;

Innovative European businesses, including start-ups and SMEs, face a real problem to attract suitable financing solutions. Adequate access-to finance is widely considered a key precondition to ensure further growth and development of these companies. One of the major weaknesses of Europe with regard to innovative SMEs lies on the lack of focus on developing intellectual property (’IP’) portfolio strategies to protect their R&D investments and make them more attractive to investors, raise growth capital and remain competitive in Europe and globally.
Access to finance requires a long and costly work of promotion and exploitation of their innovations to inform and secure commitments by investors.
Companies tend to suffer from lack of financing and the decoupling between business strategies and the generation of IP assets protecting their R&D.
This leads to three major challenges for innovative SMEs:
Without a sound IP strategy, investors will ask for higher risks premia, due to information asymmetries and the difficulty to assess the technological risk
These companies often face the trade-off between keeping control of the capital of the business and scaling up at the price of an equity dilution;
Delayed IP protection or liquidity shortages can result in innovations and skills flowing outside the EU
The development, protection and exploitation of the IP portfolio of innovative European SMEs, including start-ups, is a key element to reduce this information asymmetry. It should lead to ensuring alignment of interests between innovative SMEs and start-ups, IP advisory service providers and, ultimately, secure investors commitments.
An integrated approach to address this market failure in providing finance to innovative companies for protecting and exploiting their innovations in early development stages, without equity dilution, remains to be developed at European level. This is meant to encourage SMEs and start-ups to design and implement their IP strategy in order to facilitate access to finance.
Among EU and national level schemes, available support to companies is mainly financial. However, there is a clear need for significantly improving the effectiveness of the available counselling support through a more joined-up approach at EU level. The lack of coordination of existing schemes is a key driver of these informational asymmetries, causing duplications of assessment costs, and missed economies of scale.
Scope:
The proposed action aims at encouraging innovative SMEs and start-ups to better exploit and promote their innovative assets, as well as building a strategic vision based on their first results that should be easily assessable by the funders.
To achieve this goal, proposals should aim at designing and running a support platform, offering smart online assistance tools that may serve as a pilot test for future bound measures of InvestEU-Advisory Hub and beneficiaries of the European Innovation Council. The platform should team up experts from different backgrounds such as patent engineers, lawyers, industry specialists, finance experts, including National Promotion and Investment Banks, in an attempt to pool their offer.
The platform could contribute to this goal by:
Identifying highly innovative European SMEs and start-ups and help them to define the most value-creating business strategy to better value and protect their intangible assets;
Identifying and mobilizing European, national and regional funding programs, public and private, to facilitate the access of these SMEs and start-ups to the shared pooled or strategic support services for the protection and enhancement of intellectual property;
Help identify financial guarantees, at regional, national and European level, to reduce risk levels for the financing of SMEs by European, national and regional funding programs or National Promotion and Investment Banks and financial intermediaries;
Create a specific database of highly qualified experts and develop (pre)certification programs for them;
Create a specific smart online tool that start-ups and SMEs may use to access pooled resources, consolidated expert database, funding programs information and smart online assistance tools;
Offering individualized support services integrating, beyond the core aspects of support (legal aspects, financing dimensions…), coaching and mentoring trough highly qualified experts and smart online assistance tools, paying special attention to women-led SMEs;
Reducing the cost and increase the quality of IP-driven support services offered to start-ups and innovative businesses;
Fast-tracking the repayment capacity of the beneficiary start-ups and SMEs by increasing investors’ interest through the acceleration of the protection of their R&D and strategic intangible assets;
Reducing the risk profile and increase the financial attractiveness of start-ups through the perspective of commercial exploitation of protected and intangible assets;
Increasing the leverage effect of intangible assets for public investors (European, national and regional funding programs) and private investors (Business Angels, VCs, banks, etc.);
Helping identify other financing schemes, like blended finance combining grants and financial instruments.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Accompany at least 15 start-ups or innovative SMEs established in at least 10 EU member states or H2020 associated countries.
Enable European start-ups and innovative SMEs to protect and enhance the value of their innovations and the attractiveness for investors.
Contribute to de-risking access to strategic IP financing for start-ups and SME businesses by decreasing informational asymmetries.
Increase the leverage effect of intellectual property assets of the supported SMEs and start-ups."

","Coordination and support action
","05 February 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Open innovation is a paradigm that assumes that companies can benefit from external ideas/technologies (Outside-In) and valorise internal ideas/technologies with external partners (Inside-Out) to reduce the financial risks associated to innovation, and quickly get a competitive advantage. Open Innovation implies accelerating internal R&D and innovation along value chains through collaboration between the technological supply - and demand - side[1] within networked, multi-collaborative ecosystems.
Open innovation today is a well-known concept in large companies. However, SMEs are less aware of the opportunities offered by open innovation. Innovation intermediaries such as technology centres can help SME solution providers get closer to large industrial users to co-create[2] new products/services through a better anticipation of their needs.
One major role of technology centres is ""to bridge the gap between internal and external know-how"".[3] They are thus well-positioned as innovation intermediaries in an open innovation context. Technology centres help companies move technologies (such as digital and other key enabling technologies) from lab to market. They often achieve innovation by adapting existing ideas and concepts to other industrial ambits and usually collaborate with both large companies and SMEs.
Scope:
The action will consist of:
The setting-up of a European Open Innovation Network in advanced technologies with a central brokerage service point, aimed at matching innovation needs/requests from large industries with innovative solutions from SME technology providers.
The central brokerage service point will use the network of innovation intermediaries (e.g. technology centres) to help matching innovation needs/requests and solution offers. The consortium will define the capacity and quality criteria applicable to innovation intermediaries for joining the network. The network should span across the EU.
The brokerage services aim to liaise SME providers of solutions based on advanced technologies with potential industry users such as large (multinational) companies having specific technological challenges. The services are expected to include support and advice to companies to define their innovation requests/offers and identify possible solutions/usages (technology scouting). The services could include for example translating innovation requests into technical descriptions, technology scouting, disseminating requests through the network, proactively identifying existing solutions and providers, actively promoting solutions from SME providers towards potential users etc. The services should also include the identification of any technology services required to make the collaboration between the SME provider and the industry user successful (e.g. engineering to customise the technology solution to the customer's needs), including the identification of the technology centre(s) and expert(s) for providing these.
The services should be flexible, quick and efficient to match business needs and ensure effective matchmaking between SME solution providers and large industrial users. The brokerage services should be free of charge for SMEs.
The brokerage services should lead to a critical mass of collaboration projects between SME solution providers and (large, multinational) industry users. The network is expected to work towards financial sustainability and remain active after the end of the project.
Proposals should outline a strategic vision for building a European Open Innovation Network in advanced technologies with a central brokerage service point. The network should be open to all innovation intermediaries complying with set capacity/quality criteria. The platform should improve SME access to large industrial users and address challenges associated to Open Innovation, such as confidentiality and IPR, entry costs and proactive search for innovation partners. The impact of the brokerage services should be monitored (e.g. contracts signed by companies as a result of the brokerage services). Synergies will be sought with relevant EU and other initiatives supporting innovation in SMEs, such as the INSPIRE initiative[4] as well as the Enterprise Europe Network, in particular for making best use of existing tools for matchmaking (such as the Enterprise Europe Network database[5]) and outreach to SMEs. Synergies with the European IPR Helpdesk are also encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Critical mass of collaboration projects between SME solution providers and (large, multinational) industry users.
Sustainable network ensuring effective matchmaking, at pan-European level, between innovative solutions from SME providers and needs/usages of (large, multinational) industries.
Positive business impacts (e.g. increased sales) for SME providers having benefited from the brokerage services.
Increased provision by SMEs of innovative solutions based on advanced technologies matching the needs of industrial users.

","Innovation action
","25 July 2014
","09 September 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: The challenge is to develop new cross-sectoral industrial value chains across the EU, by building upon the innovation potential of SMEs. The EU needs to support the development of emerging industries, which will provide the growth and employment of the future. The reindustrialisation of the EU's industrial base has to focus on the development of long-term internationally competitive goods and services that require combining different competences and innovative solutions. The development of new industrial value chains calls for the collaboration and integration of different innovation actors, including large enterprises and especially SMEs, across different sectors towards the implementation of a joint vision.
SMEs need help to generate, take up and better capitalise on all forms of knowledge, creativity, craftsmanship and innovation – including for the application of existing cross-cutting or emerging technologies, ICT, eco-innovative and resource-efficient solutions, new business models, service innovation and design. The potential of clusters, that represent favourable ecosystems for innovation, need to be better exploited in this respect.
Scope: Cross-border and cross-sectoral collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship across different regions and value chains shall be promoted. The coordination and facilitation shall be led by cluster organisations and other intermediary organisations, by following a systemic approach that combines different resources, tools and instruments. Innovation actors, especially SMEs with mutually reinforcing competences, shall be supported in view of creating new industrial value chains that foster the development of emerging industries in Europe.
To this end, proposals shall outline a strategic vision for building new industrial value chains across the EU and Associated Countries. They shall specifically focus on integrating and supporting groups of SMEs in collaboration with other innovation actors in addressing specific problems and challenges. Cluster organisations or other SME intermediaries shall be invited to set up collaboration and networking activities for SMEs and create a favourable ""open space"" for cross-sectoral fertilisation and value chain innovation to take place. Each proposal should demonstrate the capacity to:
1) validate ideas for structured innovation projects driven by SMEs from different sectors and countries in collaboration with other innovation actors and facilitate the coordination towards new industrial value chains through this collaboration space.
2) support innovation activities and/or channel a mix of different targeted entrepreneurial and innovation support measures (such as mentoring, coaching, innovation and technical assistance vouchers, etc.) directly to the innovation actors of the validated innovation projects to further support their development, integration and large-scale demonstration in a strategic manner. At least 75% of the total proposed budget shall be allocated to support innovation in SMEs directly.
Further background information on the systemic approach and strategic focus to be envisaged, will be provided to applicants. Synergies with the European Structural and Investment Funds that may further[1] support such large-scale demonstration projects will also be actively encouraged, notably through the engaged SME intermediaries. “Large-scale” does not necessarily refer to the amount of financial support provided for a particular project but to the extent of the roll-out of a staged process of experimentation and implementation with accompanying support that reaches out to groups of mutually reinforcing SMEs. This approach aims at “demonstrating at large scale” the potential impact of innovative solutions to specific challenges, rather than supporting isolated projects or SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.5 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         Strengthen industrial leadership in the EU and Associated Countries by reinforcing value chains that integrate innovative solutions in SMEs, along and across existing value chains.
         Stimulate the creation of new globally competitive industrial value chains across the EU and Associated Countries to accelerate the development of emerging industries, which will boost industrial competitiveness and underpin future economic growth, jobs, and progress towards a resource-efficient economy.
Further leverage and complement support for innovation in SMEs and other funding, which may be provided by national or regional authorities (including under the European Structural and Investment Funds) and/or by private investors (upfront or as follow-up investments).
Contribute to regional smart specialisation strategies by capitalising upon concentrated and complementary competences for the development of new industrial value chains and emerging industries with a clear EU added-value.
Provide a clear and measurable contribution to the innovation performance of the supported SMEs in the short-term – as revealed by indicators such as numbers of new or significantly improved products (goods and/or services), processes, new marketing methods, or new organisational methods –, and to its impact on resource efficiency and/or turnover. A wider impact is also expected in the medium-term.
Improve the business environment of the supported SMEs by establishing open collaboration spaces that can involve innovation actors from different sectors and countries. This will lead to the creation of new ideas for innovation and new collaboration partnerships, which will be subject of further development and with the potential for further impact on business turnover.

","08 November 2016
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
According to the OECD, the US and Japan dominate R&D stocks for technologies ready for uptake by industry. 40% and 28% of the R&D stock held in OECD countries are located in the US and Japan respectively. Korea further contributes a significant share as a result of an active technology development policy followed for decades.
Technologies are however hardly accessible for European SMEs – while multinational companies face less challenges in this respect. Access to technologies overseas is hampered amongst others by a mismatch of institutions and methodologies for technologies transfer. The friction from differences in approaches to technology transfer becomes evident in the daily work of the Enterprise Europe Network in which overseas entities became members on a self-financing basis. These network partners adopt the network’s working methods but face the challenge that direct interaction is hampered by the geographic distance, as a result, real hand-on cooperation with overseas partners in the Enterprise Europe Network remain limited.
Scope:
A limited number of experimental projects between the network sector groups and overseas partners of the Enterprise Europe Network shall be supported by grants. The objective is to better capitalise the industrial R&D stock of overseas OECD countries in the context of sector groups of the Enterprise Europe Network in collaboration with clusters. The action should develop and test new service formats by taking up elements of the technology and knowledge transfer practices of the network partners in the US, Japan and Korea – and other countries as appropriate - to assist SMEs to tap the pool of industrial knowledge and technologies in these countries.
Project partners shall be partners in the Enterprise Europe Network; collaborating or supporting entities overseas do not have to be partners in the Enterprise Europe Network – cluster organisation in Europe shall be included as collaborating / supporting entities.
Expected Impact:
The projects to be supported shall mainly achieve a structural impact by:
Better integrating overseas partners in the sector groups of the Enterprise Europe Network, further developing the methods used by the Network for collaboration with overseas partners, and thereby providing a lasting better access to the results of applied industrial research in the US, Japan and Korea for European SMEs.
From the supported actions a significant number of European SMEs will get into contact with the developers of technologies ready for application overseas and possibly conclude cooperation agreements.

","Coordination and support action
","04 August 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Many SMEs struggle to embrace the Industry 4.0 revolution and the uptake of advanced manufacturing technologies and systems remains a challenge: only one in five manufacturing companies have already used advanced manufacturing solutions[1]. A recent study[2] shows that for nearly three quarters of the firms, the most important barrier to the uptake of advanced manufacturing technologies and systems is the high cost of investments in advanced manufacturing acquisition and the lack of financial resources. About half of all firms also indicate difficulties in assessing the performance and the potential business return of such technologies and/or the lack of skilled personnel required to adopt relevant technologies and business models.
Only few public initiatives today offer advisory services to manufacturing SMEs to help them assess the performance of advanced manufacturing investments and embrace advanced manufacturing solutions for turning their company towards a next-generation factory with more competitive, smarter and sustainable production ('factory of the future' concept). Besides access to such advice and expertise, also retraining and up-skilling of personnel are vital for the uptake of advanced technologies by industry, and SMEs in particular.[3]
It is demonstrated that the skills required by SMEs to deploy and innovate with advanced technologies are best acquired through practical trainings in environments where advanced technologies can be demonstrated and tested by engineers and other relevant professionals (e.g. learning by doing, learning factories, fab labs)[4]. Such environments are often an underused source for training activities. Some technology centres[5] in Europe are providing technology facilities and services to SMEs including trainings, but these centres are not evenly distributed across Europe. Besides practical trainings, the curricula in the vocational education is insufficiently addressing advanced technologies and collaboration with other relevant actors, including technology centres.
Scope:
The objective is to reinforce the competitiveness of manufacturing SMEs by providing easy and pan-European access to advanced manufacturing advice and expertise as well as training programmes. The services to be provided to the SME should be driven by its business needs and the implementation must be flexible and fast to better cope with the speed of innovation in advanced manufacturing and the SME requirements.
The action will consist of the two elements (which can be combined) listed below which will continue and expand the activities of the Advanced Manufacturing Support Centre[6] :
The roll-out of a pan-European advanced manufacturing assistance programme helping SMEs with the ambition to turn into a factory of the future: Reaching out to companies and assisting a critical mass of manufacturing SMEs with a view to transform their business towards a factory of the future with modern and sustainable production.
The coherent EU methodology, developed on the basis of good practices and existing initiatives within Member States and regions and tested through a small-scale pilot by the (virtual) European Advanced Manufacturing Support Centre, should be used as a basis for assisting companies to transform their organisation into a factory of the future.[7] SMEs will be offered assistance to elaborate a transformation plan for their company and will also be coached and guided during the implementation phase of the plan to turn their company into a factory of the future. The transformation plan should take an integrated approach to advanced manufacturing and address the innovativeness of processes and products as well as the environmental and social sustainability of manufacturing, as outlined in the EU methodology.
The roll-out of an advanced manufacturing training programme which will consist of (1) Cross-border training services to be provided to a critical mass of SMEs in cooperation with technology or training centres capable of delivering training services to SMEs in advanced manufacturing and (2) The development of framework(s) for training programmes ready to be scaled-up under the European Social Fund.
The training services should include practical, ""on-site"" training delivered at facilities where technologies can be tested and demonstrated such as pilot lines (e.g. ""learning by doing"", ""learning factories"", fab labs). Proposals should include solutions to overcome the challenge of both geographical distance and the gender segregation.
The consortium will define quality criteria for the trainings. A quality label compatible with the European quality assurance reference framework for vocational education and training (EQAVET[8]) should acknowledge the quality of the trainings provided.
For this second element of the topic, proposers are encouraged to also build on experiences from actions undertaken under the Blueprint for sectoral cooperation on skills and the identified pilot sectors identified in the Communication on a New Skills Agenda for Europe[9] which could allow a smoother roll-out of the specific frameworks for training programmes.
The consortium should be formed by a group of partner organisations with proven track records in providing innovation and training services directly to SMEs in the area of advanced manufacturing. The involvement of vocational education and training centres will be necessary to ensure the long-term impact of frameworks for training programmes.
The projects should aim to achieve critical mass and to better exploit EU-added value. The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the criteria for selection of users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted.
A minimum share of 65% of the total budget shall be allocated to provide direct assistance and trainings (two elements listed above) to SMEs.
Wherever appropriate, actions could seek synergies and co-financing from relevant national/regional research and innovation programmes, or from structural funds addressing smart specialisation. Actions combining different sources of financing should include a concrete financial plan detailing the use of these funding sources for the different parts of their activities.
Proposers are encouraged to liaise with the Enterprise Europe Network and cluster organisations, in particular for outreach to SMEs having a potential and willingness to adopt advanced manufacturing solutions and/or with specific training needs. Liaison with the relevant regional and cluster partnerships set up in the context of the Smart Specialisation Platform for Industrial Modernisation and the European IPR Helpdesk is also encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5.7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Provide a clear and measurable contribution of the advanced manufacturing assistance and training programme to the innovation performance and environmental and social sustainability of the supported SMEs, as revealed by indicators such as: numbers of new or significantly improved production processes, products or services or new organisational methods; its impact on resource efficiency; its impact on productivity, production lead times, investments and/or turnover; number of SMEs that prepared a concrete plan to upgrade their manufacturing processes during the action; its impact on technical and non­technical competences acquired and workers involvement; a wider impact on job creation is also expected to be measured in the longer term.
Frameworks for training programmes related to advanced manufacturing, ready for implementation within the duration of the action. These should propose a pathway on how to facilitate a further scaling-up under the European Social Fund.

The present Call for Proposals aims at funding projects on preventing and countering radicalisation leading to violent extremism in the area of one of the following priorities:
1. Increasing awareness, protecting, strengthening resilience of individuals and in particular vulnerable groups (such as children, youth, etc…) to polarisation.
2. Developing targeted exit programmes enabling radicalised individuals to deradicalise and disengage and rehabilitate based on an integrated multi-agency approach.
Projects must be aiming to achieve for the priority chosen one or more of the following outcomes:
1- Polarisation
- increasing awareness and capacity of first-line practitioners (e.g. police, teachers) to understand the dynamics, recognise and respond to the phenomena of polarisation at grass-roots level especially through awareness-raising and training activities;
- strengthening polarisation detection and response capacities through for example the setting up of mechanisms such as monitoring and polarisation management systems. This could enable to assess the causes and develop appropriate response to changes in community tensions and social unrests for the police and local authorities;
- promoting interaction and cooperation between different local actors from public sectors (law enforcement social services, etc) and NGOs that specialise in working with vulnerable groups and prevention of extremism as well as religious communities and other community-based organisations through the development of cooperation models;
- promoting the views of moderate voices, which are too often muted by more extreme voices through offline channels like organising debates and workshops, supported by online communication activities;
- developing and promoting concrete tools targeting vulnerable groups (e.g. via new media, application) on preventing polarisation.
2- Exit programmes
- setting up and facilitating the implementation of exit programmes building on existing programmes and offering practical assistance to individuals who want to deradicalise, disengage and rehabilitate within society. In particular, it could be done through local actors based on the development of methodological approaches and of quality and assessment criteria for interventions;
- setting up and facilitating the implementation of exit programmes that ensure continuity between interventions in the prison and probation context and further rehabilitation efforts into community in particular through local actors;
- setting up and facilitating the implementation of approaches that sow doubt in the mind of those individuals still not convinced to leave extremist groups and can lead to participation in exit programmes taking into account in the programmes, the ideology dimension (far, left wing, jihadism) but also practical and social living conditions of the individual in an integrated multi-agency approach."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: In view of fostering economically viable and sustainable development in agriculture, forestry and rural areas it is essential to close the research and innovation divide. The Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) are very different between countries, regions and sectors and generally don't fully meet the challenge to increase simultaneously productivity and sustainability in agriculture and rural areas. Despite the continued generation of knowledge through scientific projects, research results are often insufficiently exploited and taken up in practice, and innovative ideas from practice are not captured and spread.
The AKIS Collaborative Working Group of the Standing Committee of Agricultural Research advocates the distinction between science-driven research and innovation-driven research, which are governed by different incentives. Cooperation between research and extension services or farmers and other actors in the supply chain is crucial for innovation-driven research and should be promoted, notably through the EIP. Therefore, mechanisms and networks, which stimulate this interaction and knowledge exchange, should be developed in view of optimising resource use and enhancing the transition to innovation-driven research. Making available science and practice based information is an essential condition for the setting up of EIP operational groups.
Scope:Projects should involve actors from science and agricultural practice and facilitate the exchange on existing knowledge on innovative approaches in agriculture, the supply chain, and rural areas. They should help to put existing research into practice and capture creative ideas from the grassroots-level. Methods for generation of innovation-driven research should be promoted taking into account the diversity of European regions, farming and agro-food systems.
Two types of networks are foreseen: (1) a network focusing on innovation support services, whose activities would include exchange and development of methods for innovation brokering and advisory activities with a focus on innovation, and (2) a number of networks on specific themes. Activities of these networks would include synthesising, sharing and presenting best practices and research results that are near to be put into practice, but not known or tested by practitioners. The resulting innovative knowledge and easy accessible end-user material should feed into the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' for broad dissemination to farmers and other actors in the agricultural innovation chain.
The networks shall involve a wide range of actors concerned by the specific themes, including scientists, farm advisory services, innovation support services,  farmers/farmers' groups,  various groups operating in the context of EIP, SMEs, etc. Up to one network on innovation support services shall be funded in 2014; all other projects should be networks dealing with specific themes. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million per network would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Improved flow of information and knowledge between academia and practitioners in particular on agricultural and forestry practices and innovations
increased exchanges between European regions on innovative matters; new funding formats enhancing innovation-driven research; more efficient methods for innovation support services
successful deployment of the vast reservoir of existing scientific and practical knowledge
focused collection of innovative knowledge on specific themes, a greater user acceptance and intense dissemination of solutions for a more competitive and sustainable agriculture and forestry to farmers and other actors in the agricultural innovation chain
thematic networks delivering accessible and long-term available end-user material on the themes which should also generate a better targeted and shared research agenda for innovation-driven research and multi-actor projects
improved skills and education material on innovation approaches and on specific thematic areas
         Support to implementation of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability'.
Type of action: Coordination and support actions

The networks shall involve a wide range of actors concerned by the specific themes, including scientists, farm advisory services, innovation support services,  farmers/farmers' groups,  various groups operating in the context of EIP, SMEs, etc. Up to one network on innovation support services shall be funded in 2014; all other projects should be networks dealing with specific themes. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[1].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million per network would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
Improved flow of information and knowledge between academia and practitioners in particular on agricultural and forestry practices and innovations
increased exchanges between European regions on innovative matters; new funding formats enhancing innovation-driven research; more efficient methods for innovation support services
successful deployment of the vast reservoir of existing scientific and practical knowledge
focused collection of innovative knowledge on specific themes, a greater user acceptance and intense dissemination of solutions for a more competitive and sustainable agriculture and forestry to farmers and other actors in the agricultural innovation chain
thematic networks delivering accessible and long-term available end-user material on the themes which should also generate a better targeted and shared research agenda for innovation-driven research and multi-actor projects
improved skills and education material on innovation approaches and on specific thematic areas
         Support to implementation of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability'.

","Research and Innovation action
","22 April 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: In a global perspective Europe can gain from effective knowledge-based decision-making, widening its knowledge base beyond science, not the least with regard to science, technology and innovation (STI) governance itself. This requires a combined effort of a) establishing national capacity for knowledge-based policy advice across Europe, b) establishing common methodological frameworks, and c) increasing the volume and effectiveness of cross-European collaboration in order to create European added value. Initiatives have been taken towards such a development, including Mobilisation and Mutual Learning Action Plans (MML) and research in Responsible Research and Innovation frameworks, methodologies, participation. However, the potential of developing on-line services for such goals is yet unexplored.
Scope:The on-line dimension of knowledge-based decision-making should involve different mechanisms, such as Science 2.0, e-Science approaches and other collaborative functions for policy analysis, forward looking studies, technology assessment, data exchange for research etc.; trans-European collaboration tools focusing on EU level policy advice; work-flow management systems for specific methods; participatory citizen and stakeholder consultation systems; services supporting Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) methods and frameworks, including gender equality; Web-services for the project life-cycle - project definition, method choice, evaluation and management. The proposals shall probe the potential and feasibility of on-line services and develop and demonstrate on-line services that will strengthen European capacity for knowledge-based policy analysis and advice, with special emphasis on Science, technology and Innovation (STI) governance. Emphasis shall be put on a well-documented demand-side, on targeted user-centred solutions, and on usability across languages and among different institutional structures in the advisory domains. Innovation height shall be found in the functions provided, and the use of known and well tested enabling ICT technologies is to be preferred.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impacts:In the short term, open and wide-spread access of citizens, end-users stakeholders to on-line services providing processes and methods for knowledge-based policy advice, enhancing the innovation process. In the medium term, enduring organisational structures that can maintain the services after the end of the research. In the long term, greater trans-European collaboration on knowledge-based policy advice. Promotion of the objectives of citizen engagement in policy making postulated in the Lisbon Treaty.
Type of action: Research and Innovation Actions.

Specific challenge:
This action aims to empower and draw on the collective intelligence of citizens to examine the role of research and innovation via future scenarios and visions of desirable sustainable futures. It will connect scientists, stakeholders and citizens (including youth) in building shared understanding.
Scope:
This action, which follows on from the Seventh Framework Programme VOICES initiative[1], shall develop and implement methodologies for pan-European and multi-lingual face-to-face participatory and inclusive workshops with citizens (including youth, women) and other stakeholders, to devise scenarios, visions and storylines in relation to desirable sustainable European research and innovation futures. The visions and scenarios shall consider future expected advances in science and their impact on technology, society, economy, gender, health, and the environment. The deliberations shall target at least three Societal Challenges of Horizon 2020. The use of support tools for the interactive exploration of ""what if"" questions, resulting trade-offs and scenario building, are encouraged. This should include a mix of participatory multi criteria analysis, virtual reality techniques, collaborative Geographical Information System (GIS), and integrated assessment modelling, to enhance citizen understanding and exploration of desirable futures. The methods shall take on a pan-European and multilingual dimension through their deployment in 28 Member States (and some selected Associate Countries). In parallel to the face-to-face workshops, a dedicated participatory on-line consultation shall be launched (building e.g. on relevant Eurobarometer studies). The outcomes of the consultations shall be compared with those from other expert-based foresight and prospective studies to assess the relative merits of citizen focussed consultations for inspiring research and innovation policy development and implementation. The outcome of this topic shall provide inputs to the 2017 and beyond Horizon 2020 Work programmes and other relevant EU policy initiatives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.
Expected impact:
In the immediate future, this action will generate further engagement of citizens and scientific stakeholders in envisioning socially desirable futures, with a view of inspiring future research, innovation and public policies as a means to achieve these futures. In the medium term, it will contribute to enhanced understanding of the likely effects of scientific progress, to increased scientific literacy in society, and will enhance policy-makers' ability to set scientific courses in line with societal needs and aspirations.

The present work is mainly aimed at developing experimental features able to properly characterize the flow field and the aerodynamic efficiency of a turbine module to validate the specific technologies and solutions adopted for a high speed turbine. In particular, the acquired data should be able to characterize the unsteady 3-dimensional flow field developing inside the different blade rows of the rig, in order to further explain the loss production mechanisms, responsible for the efficiency of the module (measured by means of standard measurements at the shaft of the turbine) and to achieve more understanding of the effects of adopted specific design features. Furthermore, since the unsteady data acquired in the high speed test rig will include complex flow features, due to the unsteady interaction of a multi stage turbine, innovative (ad hoc developed) post-processing routines are requested in order to simplify and understand the problem. For example, proper orthogonal decomposition or time-space Fourier transform or ad-hoc modal reduction techniques should be applied to the unsteady results in order to reduce the order of the problem. The results will be adopted in order to establish design criteria for the optimization of high efficiency turbine blades for new concept aeroengines, as well as to verify different technology solutions tested in more simplified facilities."

The great challenge to validate our understanding of how flow control works during flight testing is driven by the necessity to get a clear view on a very complex 3D flow field close to the very critical aircraft stall. State-of-the art techniques like flow-cons and pressure taps give a limited view in terms of time and space on the surface. In addition time-resolving flow-field information is required near to the wall of the wing surface. For this, pressure sensing fiber-optic sensors have shown considerable potential to fulfil this need. For skin friction measurements, hot film sensors seem to be a good approach. This CfP should develop, mature, pre-test, apply these sensors for the flight test demonstration and post-process the data required to show technical readiness of flow control.

Prevention of radicalisation in prisons, in particular concerning:
choice and organisation of prison regimes to prevent radicalisation (e.g. how inmates are housed, whether they are segregated from or integrated into the general prison population);
development of de-radicalisation, disengagement and rehabilitation programmes to be used in prison;
role of religious/ethical/moral counselling of inmates to help creating a counter narrative and to promote and provide support for individual de-radicalisation processes;
development of tools providing assistance of prison staff dealing with radicalised offenders.
Promotion of alternatives to detention and exploration of the role of probation at EU level in the fight against radicalisation leading to violent extremism, in particular concerning development of de-radicalisation, disengagement and rehabilitation programmes which could be used outside the prison context (e.g. during criminal proceedings as a condition to drop prosecution before a court, as a condition to release from pre-trial detention, as a condition for a suspended prison sentence, as part of a prison sentence or in case of conditional release).
Development of risk assessment methodologies which could be used by prison administrations and judges and prosecutors (e.g. how to detect signs of radicalisation, how to distinguish between different types of terrorist suspects and their motivations, how to collaborate with law enforcement authorities, intelligence services and probation services in this respect).
The role of juvenile justice systems in the counter-terrorism context.
The cooperation between prosecutors of different Member States for the application of certain judicial cooperation instruments on issues related to counter terrorism and organised crime will be covered by JUST/2015/JCOO/AF/CRIM call.

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
This call aims to establish 4-year Framework Partnership Agreements with European networks whose statutory aims are to facilitate effective access to justice for all, including the promotion and protection of the rights of victims of crime and the rights of defence. The annual operating grants to be signed on the basis of these Framework Partnership Agreements will enhance the capacities of these networks to contribute actively to the development and implementation of the EU policies in this area.
1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will support networks whose activities contribute to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme and which will implement among others: analytical activities, training activities, mutual learning, cooperation, awareness-raising and dissemination activities with EU added value.
The activities to be carried out by these networks in the given period must contribute to the understanding and the implementation of the Directives on the rights of victims[1] and on procedural rights of suspected and accused persons[2].
In the field of victims 'rights, the activities to be carried out include, practical application of the relevant EU rules, notably the Victims 'Rights Directive, but also application of the EU rules related to compensation to victims and to increased protection of victims in cross-border cases. The activities should focus on exchanging of best practice, including best methods of implementation of the EU rules and on mutual learning. The overall objective should be to foster the cooperation among the Member State and among the responsible national authorities (national experts) and the relevant practitioners who come into contact with victims (including police, prosecution, judicial authorities, lawyers and support services).
In the field of procedural rights of suspected and accused persons activities of particular importance are those supporting the correct implementation of the Directive on the right of access to a lawyer and the Directives adopted in 2016. Activities could cover practical aspects of the implementation process of all procedural rights directives. They should provide guidance and outline best practices, and they should foster the cooperation between Member States to improve the rights of defence. Activities could also cover pre-trial detention (in particular the use of alternatives to detention) and other areas in the field of procedural rights, such as remedies.

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The objective is to contribute to achieving the objectives of the European e-Justice Strategy 2014-2018. It will support the implementation of e-Justice projects at European and national level, insofar that they have a European dimension.
The first priority will be given to support of the implementation of a platform for Mutual Legal Assistance requests regarding e-evidence, in line with the Conclusions of the Council of the European Union on improving criminal justice in cyberspace, adopted on 9 June 2016.
Secondary priorities concern project applications aiming at joining or enhancing existing or ongoing e-Justice portal projects, in particular:
Interconnection of National Insolvency Registers (IRI)[1];
Find a Lawyer (FAL);
Find a Notary (FAN);
Find a Bailiff (FAB);
Implementation of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) in case law repositories and interconnection with the e-Justice Portal;
Land Registers Interconnection (LRI);
European Court Database;
Other e-Justice portal projects related to development of the relevant EU policies, such as victims' rights, rights of suspects and accused in criminal proceedings, and projects which are in advanced stage of development or already live on the Portal at the moment when the call is published.
In addition, the Consumer Law Database, an e-Justice project being developed in 2016-2017, will receive funding for content update from the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme.
Transnational projects will receive a higher priority than national ones. Other projects which support the implementation of the e-Justice Strategy 2014-2018[2] and its Action Plan will not be excluded, subject to available budget. Applications related to projects having an A-priority under the Council e-Justice Action Plan[3] will be given priority over those having a B-priority.
1.2. Description of the activities
Project activities under this call would in principle include analytical, conceptual, design and elaboration work, IT software development, quality assurance and related auxiliary measures necessary for the establishment of new IT systems, as well as the expansion and adaptation of existing national and transnational solutions towards addressing the objectives of the call. In addition, activities related to hosting, deployment, configuration and operational support can also be considered for funding as appropriate.
Where relevant, the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation, and particularly the use of CEF Digital Building Blocks[4], should be given preference over competing or new approaches.
Activities relating to project management, content preparation, editorial work, communication, promotion and dissemination are also eligible for funding.
1.3. Expected results
implementation of a platform for Mutual Legal Assistance requests regarding e-evidence;
improved participation with the aim of achieving full EU coverage concerning all voluntary e-Justice interconnection projects – Find a lawyer, Find a notary, ECLI, LRI, etc.;
reduced risks and possibility to allow Member States to achieve early compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings;
possibility to launch potentially innovative projects and best practices concerning access to and the administration of justice at a national and in a cross-border context;
improved awareness of on-going and future e-Justice activities
[1]Given the focus on achieving compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2015/848, applications aiming at joining the current Interconnection of National Insolvency Registers operated on the e-Justice Portal on voluntary basis are no longer considered a priority.

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
The priorities of the call broadly follow the political objectives set as part of the various multiannual Council Action Plans that have been adopted to date on e-Justice. At the same time, the call aims to encourage the conception of new and innovative initiatives in the e-Justice domain.
In 2019, the objective is to support the European e-Justice Strategy and Action Plan for the 2019-2023 period[1]. More specifically, it aims to support the implementation of e-Justice projects within the European e-Justice Portal and at national level, so long as they have a European dimension. Priority will also be given to projects aiming to join or enhance existing or ongoing e-Justice Portal projects.
Against this background, the topics for 2019 are set out below:
Projects that support the implementation of the e-Justice Strategy 2019-2023 and its Action Plan. Applications concerning projects on the main list of the Council e-Justice Action Plan will have priority over other projects indicated in the Action Plan;
Find a Lawyer (FAL);
Find a Notary (FAN);
Find a Bailiff (FAB);
Implementation of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI[2]) in case law repositories and interconnection with the e-Justice Portal;
Land Registers Interconnection (LRI);
European Court Database;
Other e-Justice portal projects related to development of the relevant EU policies, such as victims' rights, rights of suspects and accused in criminal proceedings, and projects which are in advanced stage of development or already live on the Portal at the moment when the call is published.
Project applications in other areas clearly linked to e-Justice are not excluded, but will be evaluated with a lower priority in terms of relevance to the call’s objectives. e-CODEX project proposals are also not excluded insofar as they do not concern joining existing cases in the scope of the planned Telecom 2019 e-Justice DSI call (European Order for Payment, European Small Claims Procedure and other use cases defined under the e-Justice Action Plan 2019-2023).
Transnational project proposals will receive a higher priority than national ones. National projects will be funded as long as they offer clear EU added value.
2. Description of the activities
Project activities under this call would in principle include:
analytical, conceptual, design and elaboration work;
IT software development,
quality assurance including related auxiliary measures necessary for the establishment of new IT systems,
expansion and adaptation of existing national and transnational solutions towards addressing the objectives of the call.
The requirements and the application of the eIDAS Regulation[3], as well as the use of the CEF Digital Building Blocks[4] should be taken into account if relevant.
Activities relating to project management, content preparation, editorial work, communication, promotion and dissemination are also eligible for funding.
Activities must take place in countries participating to the Justice Programme to be eligible for funding.
3. Expected results
Improved participation with the aim of achieving full EU coverage concerning all voluntary e-Justice interconnection projects;

1. Priorities
The aim of this call is to contribute to the effective and coherent application of EU criminal law in the area of the rights of victims of crime (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/victims/index_en.htm).
The first and main priority is the implementation and practical application of the following instruments:
Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime;
Directive 2011/99/EU on the European Protection Order;
Regulation (EU) 606/2013 on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters;
Directive 2004/80/EC relating to compensation to crime victims.
Project proposals should be focused on actions that ensure maximum practical benefits and impact for victims of crime, including:
development and testing of efficient methods and tools for providing information to victims about the type of support they can obtain and from whom, the procedures for making complaints, how and under what conditions they can access compensation, as well as all other information about victims' rights depending on the specific needs and communicated in a manner taking into account the personal characteristics of the victim.
development of secure communication channels allowing for referral of victims by the competent authority that received the complaint (or other public services that come into first contact with victims) to the relevant support organisations with full respect of victims’ wishes, privacy and protection of personal data;
development of practical methods of cooperation among the relevant actors in cases of cross-border victimisation, including facilitating the exchange of information to ensure that cross-border victims get access to information, support, protection and to compensation;
development of procedures, protocols or other tools for carrying out individual assessment of victims' needs in practice;
actions to improve the cooperation between the relevant assisting and decising authorithies as well as central contact points established by Directive 2004/80/EC to facilitate victims' effective access to compensation.
development of methods aimed at strengthening victims' protection, including the promotion of the use of protection orders, training of professionals about the conditions for issuing protection orders and the applicable procedures for requesting mutual recognition of protection measures in another Member State, and the promotion of benchmarks and practices established by the research already funded by the Commission. (The POEMS Study ""Mapping the legislation and assessing the impact of Protection Orders in the European Member States"", http://poems-project.com/).
Proposals whose main purpose is to assess the transposition of the above-listed instruments into national law are not a priority of this call.
The second priority of the call is the identification of possibile gaps and needs to improve the current EU legislation in the area of victims’ rights.
2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will cover the following activities:
mutual learning, exchange of good practices, development of working methods which may be transferable to other countries, including those countries that do not participate in the call;
exchange and provision of information and development of information tools;
capacity building for professionals;
facilitating cooperation between competent authorities and other agencies or organisations coming into contact with victims such as legal practitioners and/or service providers (including multi-disciplinary networks at international, national, regional or local levels);
analytical activities, such as data collection and creation of data bases, surveys, research etc;
dissemination and awareness raising activities.
Regarding the first priority of the call, projects focusing on research and other analytical activities will be considered. Nonetheless, such actions should have a strong element of knowledge sharing across the European Union between different actors and stakeholders working on victims’ rights.
Under the second priority, projects could include analytical activities, such as research, surveys and data collection and include the analysis of the current legal situation, including its possibile deficiencies in responding to practical problems encountered by victims of crime and/or suggesting best methods for ensuring victims access to their rights.
Training activities can also be funded under this call, as long as they are of ancillary nature and not constitute the main purpose of the project."

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
1. Priorities
The objective is to contribute to the effective and coherent application of EU law in the areas of civil law, criminal law and fundamental rights, judicial ethics and the rule of law, by helping to address the training needs of justice professionals in these fields. It also targets the specific training needs of court staff and bailiffs, as well as prison and probation staff.
The 2019 priorities will focus on training activities and tools for training providers to:
1. tackle gaps in training for:
court staff and bailiffs, for example by cross-border training activities or exchanges of good training practices, in all areas of EU civil, criminal and fundamental rights law relevant for their judicial work;
prison and probation staff, for example by cross-border training activities or exchanges of good training practices, on EU law and fundamental rights relevant for their work, including on countering radicalisation to violent extremism in prison, on the minimum standards laid down by the Council of Europe or on rehabilitation programmes;
2. support the training of justice professionals, in particular via:
seminars with easy linguistic access (e.g. by providing interpretation in the languages of all participants, national breakout groups or linguistic programme components) to attract legal practitioners that are reluctant to participate in a seminar in a foreign legal language and therefore have not yet participated in from cross-border training activities;
cross-border training activities for multipliers, such as judicial trainers or EU law court coordinators, where there are guarantees that the multipliers will pass on their knowledge to other legal practitioners in a systematic way;
training activities with participants from at least two different justice professions, such as judges/prosecutors, judges/lawyers, lawyers/notaries, courts staff/bailiffs, court experts/court interpreters, prison/probation staff, to stimulate discussions across judicial professions about the application of EU law and contribute to a European legal culture across professional boundaries.

Proposals not in line with these topics, may still be awarded grants if the applicants can justify their training topics by a convincing evidence-based training needs assessment, demonstrating that more training is needed for the proper application of EU law in the suggested field.
Target group
This call supports training of members of the judiciary and judicial staff, i.e. judges, prosecutors, court officers, other legal practitioners associated with the judiciary, such as lawyers, notaries, bailiffs, insolvency practitioners and mediators, as well as court interpreters and translators, prison and probation staff.
Distribution of financial support between different topics
Priority will be given to projects that do not duplicate existing training material or on-going projects but that are complementary or innovative.
A fair balance between topics and/or target audience may be sought.
2. Description of the activities
The training activities implemented by each project must include participants (trainees) from different eligible countries.
This call will fund training activities such as:
the organisation of interactive, practice-oriented seminars (including implementation of training modules created by the European Commission on EU legislation in civil law[1]);
multilateral exchanges between justice professionals (except for judges and prosecutors whose training bodies are members of the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN) and may thus take part in the exchanges organised by the EJTN);

Projects should cover the legal terminology used in the work environment of practitioners;
Knowledge of the legal systems of the Member States;
Once it is released, the use of the search tool of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) to identify foreign judicial decisions, notably in the context of the ""acte clair"" doctrine of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU).
Proposals outside of these priority topics
Since the assessment of European judicial training needs cannot be solely conducted at EU level and is mainly done nationally and even locally, policy priorities mentioned in the annual work programme are indications of possible topics of supported projects. Regarding proposals not in line with these priorities, they may still be awarded funding if applicants can justify the suggested training topics by an evidence-based needs assessment, showing that more training is needed for the proper application of EU law in the field to be covered.
Target group
The training should target members of the judiciary and judicial staff, meaning judges, prosecutors and court officers, as well as other legal practitioners associated with the judiciary, such as lawyers, notaries, bailiffs, probation officers, mediators, court interpreters and translators, who are involved in the application of the relevant instruments.
Distribution of financial support between different topics
When deciding on the allocation of grants, a fair balance between topics and/or target audience may be sought.
Moreover, priority will be given to projects that do not duplicate existing training material[1] or on-going projects but that act in complementarity or that innovate.
2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
The training activities implemented by each project must include participants (trainees) from different participating countries. Ideally, they should be trained together without a majority of participants from one country.
In the priority areas defined above (including those identified by a needs assessment), this call will fund activities such as:
Organisation of interactive, practice-oriented training activities;
Multilateral exchanges between legal practitioners (except for judges and prosecutors whose training bodies are members of the EJTN and may thus take part in the exchanges organised by the EJTN);
Creation of training content, whether for presential learning, blended learning or e‑learning, either ready-to-use by trainers or by practitioners for self-learning;
Tools for training providers (for example: train-the-trainers events, tools to support the organisation of training in other Member States, etc.).
Projects that roll out training modules created by the Commission on European legislation can also benefit from funding.
All these activities can take place in the context of initial training (induction-period) or continuous training of the participants (for example: training activities to familiarize newly appointed legal practitioners with EU legislation and judicial cooperation instruments; or more specialised training activities for practicing legal practitioners).
Projects targeting ""Knowledge of the legal systems"" should cover the legal systems which have particular relevance for the participants and involve experienced legal practitioners who will be able to compare experience and practice of application of EU legal instruments.
Projects should also aim at encouraging practitioners to follow training in a foreign language, either by providing simultaneous high-quality interpretation into their native language or by easing the participation with foreign language training (for example with an introduction to the relevant legal terminology of the topics covered prior to or at the beginning of the training activity, or with a linguistic warm-up by actively involving participants at the beginning of the training activity, etc).
Training methodology
Applications should notably take into account recommendations resulting from the Advice for training providers[2] or expand good practices[3] revealed by the EU pilot project on European Judicial Training to other Member States or legal professions.
The learning methodology must be practice-oriented and interactive for all types of training, whether face-to-face or online or otherwise. Different methodologies may be used during a training activity.
Face-to-face training activities should give room for and incite exchange of experiences of participants, possibly also outside the classrooms. They should pay particular attention to cost effectiveness.
The projects shall comprise evaluation of the training activities. They should also comprise evaluations some time after the training, assessing if and how the knowledge and/or know-how acquired has been used in the daily practice of the participant (impact assessment).
Dissemination strategy
The funded projects are expected to have a clear dissemination strategy of their results, including for example dissemination of ready-to-use training material for practitioners or trainers on the European e-Justice Portal[4].
If training material or modules are developed, attention should be paid to the language in which they are developed (and/or translated) in view of their re-usability and how future up-dates of this material can be ensured. Training material that cannot be understood by itself must be complemented with explanations during the dissemination phase in order to help other training providers or trainers to re-use it.

1. Priorities and activities to be funded
1.1. Priorities
The objective is to contribute to the effective and coherent application of EU law in the areas of civil law (including consumer law), criminal law and fundamental rights, to judicial ethics and the rule of law, by covering training needs' gaps in these fields. It also targets the specific training needs of court staff.
The priorities of 2017 will concentrate funding on training activities and tools for training providers described below:
1. tackle gaps in cross-border cooperation of training providers, mainly by
a) setting up or expanding a network of contact points of training providers (or similar cooperation mechanisms) for lawyers, notaries, court staff/bailiffs, prison and probation staff with the aim of exchanging information on training needs in EU law or implementation of sanctions in respect of fundamental rights and countering radicalisation, opening national training activities to foreign participants, exchange of trainers, finding partners for regional training activities and/or collecting information on training possibilities for the European Training Platform,
b) start cooperation among private training providers for legal professions (in particular lawyers), aiming at expanding the offer in EU law training, the implementation of the advice for training providers by DG Justice and contributing to the yearly report on European judicial training by DG Justice,
c) preparatory work that will facilitate more recognition of foreign training activities to fulfil training obligations for lawyers (e.g. analysis of gaps of current recognition practice and development of a system to close them),
d) cross-border initial training activities (face-to-face activities or exchanges), covering as many Member states as possible, to create a common European legal culture from the start of entering a legal profession (except for newly appointed judges and prosecutors for whom the equivalent activity is funded via the operating grant for the EJTN),
e) organising joint study visits to EU courts by legal practitioners (other than judges/prosecutors, already covered by the operating grant for the EJTN) from as many different Member States as possible;
2. tackle gaps in training on EU law for court staff and bailiffs by cross-border training activities on all areas of EU civil, criminal and fundamental rights law relevant for their judicial work;
3. support the training of mainly judges, prosecutors, lawyers and notaries on EU civil, criminal and fundamental rights law, legal systems of the Member States, judicial ethics and the rule of law, knowledge of cross-border IT tools and linguistic skills of legal practitioners in areas with particular added value, in particular via
a) seminars with easy linguistic access (for example, by providing interpretation in the languages of all participants, national breakout groups or linguistic programme components) to attract also legal practitioners to cross-border training activities that are reluctant to participate in a seminar in a foreign legal language and therefore have not been reached by previous cross-border training activities,
b) cross-border training activities for multipliers, such as judicial trainers or EU law court coordinators, where there are guarantees that the multipliers will pass on their knowledge to other legal practitioners in a systematic way,
c) training activities with participants from at least two of the profession areas judges/prosecutors, lawyers/notaries, courts staff/bailiffs, court experts/court interpreters, prison/probation staff, in order to stimulate discussions across judicial professions about the application of EU law and so to contribute to create a European legal culture across professional boundaries.
For priority area 3), the topics of the training activities could cover EU legislation that recently entered into force and / or demonstrate the interconnection of the different EU instruments relevant in a specific field, such as: family matters, commercial matters, recovery of assets, procedural criminal rights, mutual legal assistance, etc. An evidenced-based needs assessment for the topic of the training activity is essential.
Target group
In general, this call supports training of members of the judiciary and judicial staff, meaning judges, prosecutors, court officers, other legal practitioners associated with the judiciary, such as lawyers, notaries, bailiffs, insolvency practitioners and mediators, as well as court interpreters and translators, prison and probation staff. For each priority it is indicated which part of the target group is addressed.
Distribution of financial support between different topics
When deciding on the allocation of grants, a fair balance between topics and/or target audience may be sought. Grants addressing the priorities 1.a and 1.b are preferred.
Moreover, priority will be given to projects that do not duplicate existing training material or on-going projects but that act in complementarity or that innovate.
1.2. Description of the activities
Projects must be transnational and involve organisations from at least two participating countries. In addition the training activities implemented by each project must include participants (trainees) from different participating countries.

Tools for training providers (for example: train-the-trainers events, tools to support the organisation of training in other Member States, etc.).
If nothing else is indicated in the priority, the activities can take place in the context of initial training (induction-period) or continuous training of the participants (for example: training activities to familiarize newly appointed legal practitioners with EU legislation and judicial cooperation instruments; or more specialised training activities for practicing legal practitioners).
Projects targeting ""legal systems of the Member States"" (in priority 3.) should cover the legal systems which have particular relevance for the participants and involve experienced legal practitioners who will be able to compare experience and practice of application of EU legal instruments.
Training methodology
Applications should notably take into account recommendations resulting from the Advice for training providers by the DG Justice and Consumers[2] or expand good practices[3] revealed by the EU pilot project on European Judicial Training to other Member States or legal professions.
Duration
The initial project duration should not exceed 36 months.
Dissemination strategy
The funded projects are expected to have a useful strategy of disseminating their results to other training providers and/or potential participants.
1.3. Expected results
Increased knowledge of EU civil, criminal and fundamental rights instruments among legal practitioners;
Improved mutual trust between legal practitioners in cross-border judicial cooperation;
Improved cooperation of training providers of the different legal professions;

The aim of this call will be to implement actions included in the European Agenda on Security [http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/basic-documents/docs/eu_agenda_on_security_en.pdf] adopted in April 2015 regarding the criminal justice response to prevent radicalisation leading to terrorism and violent extremism, and in particular the actions set out in the JHA Council Conclusions on enhancing the criminal justice response to radicalisation [http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/11/20-conclusions-radicalisation/] of 20 November 2015, as follow up to the High level Ministerial conference on the criminal justice response to radicalisation organised in October 2015 by the European Commission [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/response-radicalisation-2015/index_en.htm].
Priority will be given to the following actions:
1. De-radicalisation/disengagement/rehabilitation programmes in prisons. Projects should be tailor-made to prevent violent radicalisation and terrorist recruitment. Proposed actions should ideally build on or replicate existing successful programmes and models for this purpose while being adapted to national or local circumstances and the needs of the individuals involved. The projects could include one or a combination of (but not be limited to) the following elements:
- developing risk assessment tools and tools to detect early signs of radicalisation among detainees, and strengthening information sharing between prison administrations and the various actors in the criminal justice chain;
- involvement and training of religious representatives in prisons, social workers and counsellors;
- enabling a secure prison environment to operate effective rehabilitation and reintegration programmes to avoid any risks of radicalisation or recruitment to terrorist groups, with due attention to the level of respect and interactions between prison staff and detainees;
- preparation of release, and programmes during probation or post-release, to promote reintegration of individuals at risk of radicalisation or willing to disengage;
- development of a multi-agency approach for the efficient implementation and follow-up of de-radicalisation/disengagement/rehabilitation programmes;
- evaluation of de-radicalisation/disengagement/rehabilitation programmes in prisons (new or existing).
2. Risk assessment tools for the judiciary. The Council Conclusions, mentioned above, call on Member States to consider alternative or additional measures to prevent, as far as possible, radicalisation and terrorist recruitment in prisons. Such measures may include, where appropriate, alternative or additional measures to prosecution and/or detention in all stages of the procedure, among which rehabilitation, including as a condition for probation or suspension of prison sentences. To enable national judicial authorities to determine such appropriate measures, proposed actions should develop risk assessment tools, which should be based on an individual approach and include the possibility to re-evaluate the risk at regular intervals, while taking due account of security and public safety concerns. Actions could also include one or a combination of (but not be limited to) the following elements:
- Putting developed risk assessment tools (new or existing) in practical use, preferably in a multi-disciplinary and holistic way, including, where appropriate, sharing of relevant information between law enforcement, security services and prosecution and, where applicable, with local authorities and social workers; this could be done by setting up multi-disciplinary bodies or working methods or otherwise ensuring that the follow-up of the cases is done in an integrated way.
- Evaluation of risk assessment tools (new or existing) and their practical use.
3. Training of professionals (in particular prison management and staff, probation officers, prosecutors, judiciary, prison chaplains/imams, counsellors) involved in dealing with radicalised violent extremists or those at risk of becoming radicalised, in a sustained and multi-disciplinary way. The training programmes should use and/or replicate, to the extent possible, the support, tools and materials available at EU and international level to avoid duplication and build on existing best practices. A special focus should be given to the use of risk assessment tools, implementation of de-radicalisation/disengagement/rehabilitation programmes, the use of alternatives to detention, counselling and the development of counter narratives to violent radicalised ideas. Training programmes could be offered in a variety of methods (traditional courses, webinars, exchange of staff for capacity building, study visits etc.). Beneficiaries should also be ready to share or disseminate training materials at EU or international level.
Description of the activities to be funded under this topic
This call will cover the following activities:
analytical activities, such as data collection, surveys, research activities, evaluations etc;
mutual learning, identifying and exchange of best practices, development of working methods which may be transferable to other participating countries;
exchange and provision of information and development of information tools;
training activities;
capacity building for professionals;
facilitating cooperation between competent authorities and agencies, legal practitioners and/or service providers (including multi-disciplinary networks at international, national, regional or local levels);
dissemination and awareness raising activities.
Beneficiaries should be ready to share project results and best practices at EU level and to contribute to the discussion on how to best prevent radicalisation."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe is strong in research capabilities, the ability to industrialize products and competences in terms of material research related to battery chemistry. However, the step towards large-scale mass production of competitive battery technology (mainly Li-ion / advanced Li-ion) has not been established so far and still requires fundamental research. Especially when moving to cell materials beyond conventional Li-Ion battery for mobility applications, it is no longer possible to rely on classic cell design methodology to achieve the ambitious goals set for cell technology after 2025 (both generation 3b and generation 4). As such, advanced modelling and simulation tools are required that specifically target the electrode and cell level and addressing the fundamental understanding of materials and cell behavior. These tools are vital to support future cell development, but require significant advancements in order to meet this challenge. Not only the material characterization must be considered, but in particular the validation of the models and simulation tools must be of utmost priority.
These efforts will require sufficient prototype manufacturing of cells to measure and validate, and is expected to result in a key cornerstone in the overall framework needed to improve European competitiveness in cell design and manufacture. Via a highly dynamical iterative exchange process between prototyping, simulation and newly developed analytical tools an accelerated development process can be established, leading to a significantly accelerated adoption of new battery technologies to the market.
Scope:
Proposals should address all of the following items:
Advanced modelling approaches based on different physical domains correctly describing the behaviour of micro-structures in advanced Li-ion cell chemistries and 3D structure, but also considering packing conditions under arbitrary usage scenarios. The new model approaches should be able to take into account the behavior, performance and both homogeneous and inhomogeneous/heterogeneous ageing
Systematic measurements of basic input parameters for modelling (like heat coefficients, diffusion coefficients, conductivity etc. ) to establish a reliable data base for these parameters. This may require measurement techniques and methodologies that may not even currently exist, in order to sufficiently confirm that the simulation data, results and predictions to match the actual cell behavior observed (this could also include new measurement tools to monitor changes in electrode structure or cells, for example mechanical stresses, changes in porosity, microstructure) including complete cell behavior (with respect to formation and cycling) needed for the simulation models and future progress with new advanced modelling approaches.
Manufacture of prototype cells or cell components with distinctive features to allow 1) generating input parameters to initialize the model, and 2) validating the usability of the simulation models and, at the same time, being clearly conform with future industrialization efforts. Cooperation with projects in LC-BAT-5-2019 can provide support to design, manufacturing and sensitization aspects.
Demonstrate sufficient correlation between cell measurements and simulation, especially for all relevant cell design needs, as well as the validity and robustness of the models for multiple test variations which account for the relatively big state-space of electrochemical systems. (models should not be just optimized for one particular test case, but also show good correlation with valid test variations).
Additionally some specific aspects can be also considered, such as:
Sensitivity analysis on model parameters to assess governing parameters and model robustness can also be performed to allow an efficient calibration method and experimentation.
Investigation of tolerances for cell production by means of simulation, study and prediction failure propagation and consequences on ageing and safety.
Assessment of EOL properties of newly high optimized (>300Wh/kg) developed cell chemistries based on combined simulation / experimental validation approach, referring to automotive standards & requirements.
Investigation of new methodologies and procedures to shorten the endurance validation of cells, in terms of functionalities, ageing and safety.
For future battery industry collaborative round-table approaches would achieve a considerable gain, bringing together the whole value chain from academia to the OEM. Furthermore, this can bring together representatives from experimental & simulation fields of expertise, exchanging their knowledge via a structured approach.
The activities should thus focus on a multidisciplinary approach from fields of expertise in simulation and experimental field, investigating battery chemistries most relevant for the automotive field in the next 5-10 years and oriented on the specific ERTRAC energy density targets for advanced Li-ion technologies (generation 3b). By means of such a round table approach; at least TRL 5 level or above is aspired. The synergetic development approach by combining simulation and rapid prototyping on the experimental side is expected to speed up the development processes of battery technologies relevant for cell production in Europe, targeting the automotive market.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The final simulation solution should not increase significantly computing costs and should be compatible with available computing resources in modern engineering workplace, while providing the following benefits:
Reduce the development time and cost for battery cell up to 30% each.
Get a better optimum of the design thanks to the analysis based on different physical domains.
Demonstrate the potential for reduction of number of experiments by factor 3, for the overall development process.
Reduce battery R&I cost by 20%
It is expected that progress in the area of new and innovative measurement technologies would lead, at some point, to standardized measurement procedures."

Awareness of the need for a competitive European knowledge base in Li-ion cell technology and manufacturing processes has led to the establishment of a multitude of non-industrial pilot lines all around the EU, recently. Many of these activities are focussed on highly specific systems or processes, and can each alone hardly keep up with the immense advancements of battery cell production, particularly in Asia. In order to maximize the benefits of the related investments, mutual exchange of data, expertise, and access rights between these pilot lines would be desirable. Therefore, a network of Li-ion pilot lines shall be built, which should include industrial stakeholders, thus establishing the competencies, value chains, and unique selling propositions of the arising European innovation and production ecosystem for li-ion cell technologies. It will be of particular relevance to jointly develop strategies for scaling up the impact of the network and to support the market access of European cell production companies in view of international competition and standardization. Availability of industrial scale or pilot scale production lines can be challenging within Europe. Li-ion battery is an emerging technology established on know-how of the specific companies. There will be difficulties to having a common approach on pilot production facilities due to information security reasons.
Scope:
Proposals should address all the following issues:
Determine the competence profiles of EU Li-ion battery cell pilot lines regarding technologies, production scale, testing & validation, expertise and specialisation;
Analyse skill and equipment gaps the pilot lines are suffering from in view of arising technology paradigms and worldwide competition;
Outline a standardized data exchange platform to further the Li-ion cell production know-how in Europe;
Develop models for the shared access to the pilot lines and for the collaboration of academia and industry including the access of observers as well as for solutions regarding IPR-management ensuring the ownership of IP within the collaboration;
Develop a common type of contract for ensuring information security of the pilot lines beneficiaries;
Identify opportunities for the network to exchange results and to work on energy- and resource efficient production processes;
Following establishment of the above points, a round-robin of parameter measurements in European Li-ion cell pilot lines who allow external access to compare qualification method and match results and to analyse sensitivity of cell properties to production effects;
Organize joint workshops and conferences within the network and create platforms for mutual learning and focussed training;
Develop a roadmap of joint strategies for the network to scale up pilot processes from small batch testing towards processes of industrial dimension. This shall outline recommendations and harmonize actions regarding funding, accelerated technology transfer, IPR, roles and responsibilities as well as for business models;
Carry out dissemination actions to build the network incorporating public and private stakeholders along the value chain and conceptualize formats to increase visibility of the network.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 to 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The established network of Li-ion cell pilot lines should lead to:
Further the production of Li-ion cells towards industrial scale in Europe
Better utilize synergies of mutual collaboration of pilot lines
Increase the basis of trained Li-ion battery cell experts in Europe
Ensure fair competition, open source and access within the network and stakeholders
Establish a Unique selling proposition (USP) for efficiency in Li-ion cell production
Create visibility of the network

Stationary applications such as utility grids and industrial sites require storage applications that have the ability to combine high power and heavy use, going through multiple deep cycles per day, with a long lifetime and maximum safety. In addition, future battery systems should have optimal sustainability throughout the entire supply chain, including the substitution of critical raw materials, second-life, and recycling. Current generation Li-ion batteries, despite their success in e-mobility, may not be the ultimate solution for stationary storage; in addition, the growth of Li-Ion battery market is not enough to meet the demand for stationary and e-mobility applications. Interest in next-generation Li-ion and non-Li-ion batteries (for example molten salt, metal-air, lithium-sulphur, sodium, flow batteries, solid state, new ion-based systems) for these applications is growing, but many fundamental and technological obstacles remain to be overcome. This challenge is in line with the identified priorities in the context of the SET-Plan.
Scope:
The objective is to develop and validate or demonstrate innovative next-generation battery technologies for stationary energy storage that have a low cost, high safety, high depth of discharge, and high cycle life and efficiency. Development must include the integration of sensors and/or battery management electronics in the cell, and the potential for upscaling the battery systems. The battery systems should have optimal sustainability throughout the entire supply chain, including the substitution of critical raw materials. A key issue is the design of an efficient production process with minimal environmental impacts across the whole life-cycle, including recycling. Solutions must be validated or demonstrated in a relevant environment. Since cost is the most important driver for grid scale electricity storage, targets for key performance indicators such as capital cost, storage cost and end-of-life cost should be set. ""Balance of plant"" components should be included in cost estimates.
The activities are expected to bring the technology from TRL 3 to TRL 5 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Project results are expected to contribute to:
Assure best possible performance and lifecycle for the next-generation battery technologies for stationary energy storage at lowest cost, in particular by putting the energy storage cost on the path to fall below 0.05 €/kWh/cycle by 2030;
Reduce the pressure on limited natural resources due to longer battery lifespan, improved recyclability and the use of more abundant and less harmful materials;
Speeding up development and subsequent deployment of batteries for energy storage applications.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Redox flow batteries (RFB) are considered prime candidates for grid-scale stationary energy storage due to their ability to store large amounts of electrical energy for extended periods and release it quickly when needed. Their extended lifetime and reasonable efficiency are additional benefits. The redox couples and the electrolytes are the most important component in redox flow batteries, as they largely determine system energy density and cost. Currently used RFB rely on metal-based redox pairs that are non-indigenous to Europe, and can be highly corrosive and sometimes toxic. In addition, these systems are mostly water-based, which can potentially result in water electrolysis at high voltage, and membrane cross-over. Mining and extraction of metals can have substantial social and environmental impact. These issues all affect the cell's efficiency, cost, safety and sustainability. The challenge is to identify suitable redox pairs and electrolyte chemistries for low-cost, high-efficiency and sustainable stationary RFB systems that are optimised in terms of redox potential, electrochemical reaction reversibility, chemical stability, solubility and material availability. Since extensive laboratory testing is both time consuming and costly, modelling and simulation is needed to prioritise promising redox species for further analysis and testing. This challenge is in line with the identified priorities in the context of the SET-Plan.
Scope:
The objective is to develop mathematical models for numerical simulation and high-volume pre-selection of multi-species electrolyte flow and electrochemistry. Models should allow the characterisation of new chemicals and designs, the related charge, mass and heat transport mechanisms, identifying cell-limiting mechanisms, forecasting cell performance and optimising the design and scale-up. Of particular interest are performances in terms of cell voltage, energy and power density, reliability and cost.
The simulation models should be validated with experimental examples from known chemistries and representative prototypes, and show how new chemistries can be explored.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposed action should allow to significantly enhance research and engineering processes, and accelerating the search for new non-rare and non-toxic redox couples and electrolytes. These would allow reducing production costs in materials and component development, contributing to optimising the design and performance of full-scale low-cost and environmentally sustainable RFB systems for balancing intermittent renewables on a grid scale. Project results should in the medium to long-term term contribute to reach the targets set in the SET Plan and stimulate investment in the low-carbon energy sector, with the long term aim to boost innovation-driven growth and industrial competitiveness in stationary electrical energy storage.

Redox flow batteries (RFB) are considered prime candidates for grid-scale stationary energy storage due to their ability to store large amounts of electrical energy for extended periods and release it quickly when needed. Key features include their scalability, independent sizing of energy and power rating, room temperature operation and potential long cycle life. However, currently used RFB rely on redox couples that are non-indigenous to Europe, not widely available and therefore relatively costly. In addition, the voltage and energy density that can be achieved in aqueous flow batteries are constrained by undesired water electrolysis and the low solubility of the active species. This challenge is in line with the identified priorities in the context of the SET-Plan[1].
Scope:
The objective is to develop and validate RFB based on new redox couples and electrolytes (such as organic or earth-abundant substances) that are environmentally sustainable, have a high energy and power density, maximise lifetime and efficiency, while minimising their cost. Validation of new designs must include testing of full-size prototypes in pilot facilities.
Specific issues to be addressed include:
Long-term stability of the redox couples under repetitive voltage swings, and their enhanced solubility and reversibility;
Low membrane resistance (or even membrane-free systems);
Improved electrode reaction kinetics;
Upscaling (especially increasing the reaction surface);
Improved battery control systems;
Environmental sustainability; and
Safety aspects (toxicity, flammability).
Since cost is the most important driver for grid scale electricity storage, targets for key performance indicators such as levelised cost of energy (€/MWh), cost per surface power density (€/Wm-2) and capital cost (€/kWh of capacity) should be set.

The high growth rate of electrified vehicles (xEV) with substantial unit forecasts is driving the demand for electrochemical battery cells. To achieve a significant market share for European suppliers, global competitiveness for xEV batteries has to be achieved.
For the future it is important that European industry and research have the system knowledge in next generation lithium ion battery technology (generation 3b) covering the full value chain and the capability to provide the most essential parts of them both at cell and at the system levels: the cells and their constituent components (anode and cathode materials, separators, electrolytes), the control and sensor systems and the assembly know how. At the same time competitiveness in terms of performance, safety, cycle and calendar life has to be achieved.
With the intended research the development of a strong European industrial base in this field has to be supported. In addition to this topic, topic LC-BAT-1-2019 of this call addresses solid state battery electrochemistry issues, in a longer term perspective..
Scope:
The activities will be based on a multidisciplinary approach that includes the system knowledge for the most promising electrochemistries to achieve possible production-readiness by two to three years after the end of the project. The whole system performance for batteries has to be addressed and related monitoring systems / smart management have to be developed (TRL 5-6 achievement at the project end). The advanced performance parameters critical to customer acceptance (low cost per unit of energy and power capacity, safety, resistance to high-power charging, durability), environmental sustainability (energy-efficient manufacturing, recyclability and 2nd life usage) and aspects for large scale manufacturing solutions have to be considered.
At least one of the following bullet points has to be addressed (although a full integration of the three bullet points would provide the best impact):
Research in cell chemistry, cell morphology & cell architecture to:
a) maximise energy and power density;
b) reduce critical raw materials (in particular cobalt) use per unit stored energy;

Europe is leader in the development of components for buildings retrofitting. Its leadership is based on the use of high-efficient insulation materials including concrete, steel, glass, composites, wood and hybrids, which should lead to achieving recyclable, nearly zero-energy building envelopes (roofs, façades) when applied to new buildings. However, these components do still not allow for the integration of smart energy storage and for an equal performance in existing buildings. This has proved to be very challenging, in terms of complexity, weight control and overall retrofitting costs. Therefore, work is required to advance the technology readiness level. Activities should include the demonstration of new hybrid-enabled prototypes for selected non-residential buildings.
Scope:
The development of lightweight components based on high-efficiency insulation materials needs adding active energy management capabilities without increasing weight. Proposals should cover all of the following:
development of lightweight components for the construction of building envelopes with integral means for combined active/passive management of energy transfer, i.e., for active insulation, heath diversion, storage and directional transfer;

modelling of the materials and components as well as to the development of novel testing methodologies oriented towards assessing the long-term performance of the elements. This should include the estimation of durability and service life;
reduced maintenance costs, possibility of use in a wide range of environmental conditions, favour renewable resources, respect of sustainability principles (International Reference Life Cycle Data System - ILCD Handbook), and the possibility of reuse at the end of service life.
This topic is likely to contribute to standardisation and certification activities.
Resources should be envisaged for clustering with other projects funded under the call, in order to facilitate research cohesion and inter-consortia cooperation.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
When compared to state of the art, the newly developed solutions should bring:
Improvement by at least 25% of the insulation properties at component level for a given weight, when in isolation (passive) mode;
10% improvement in energy-storage capability when in active mode(s);
Water and air tightness should be at least 10% higher than existing solutions (when it is proposed a controllable solution);
Cost increase of less than 15%, in order to allow market uptake across Europe and contribute to social affordability.

The Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools developed so far are adapted mainly to new buildings (all types). In order to offer easy, practical, operational tools for all stakeholders, including constructing companies, designers, architects and service companies, we need to deploy attractive tool kits also for existing buildings. A particular important challenge will be to produce compatible tools that would allow collecting of data from existing buildings (e.g. geometric data) and exploit data from different sources. This will also contribute to more accurate knowledge of the existing building stock by providing methods and tools to generate data for existing buildings. Such BIM tools will be exploited first and foremost in existing residential buildings.
Scope:
Proposals should develop advanced solutions, including all of the following:
To harmonise and provide common data exchange formats regarding the components and equipment of a building (e.g. the type of materials and the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in relation to the most actual standards);
The modelling of the building energy should include existing parameters, as well as the environmental and GIS data;
Be flexible in coupling the overall BIM system with other additional types of models (e.g. buildings acoustics; including calculator for economic evaluation of various renovations scenarios);
Be flexible to adapt to work planning, as-buildings documentation and procedures to process changes;
Allow the development of applications to benefit from inputs of inhabitants;
A close cooperation with standardisation bodies is required in order to validate the new BIM tools.

Proposals should achieve all of the following:
A reduction of the renovation working time of at least 15-20% compared to current practices with the baseline defined in the proposal;
Acceleration of the market uptake across Europe, by speeding-up industrial exploitation, in particular amongst constructing/ renovations companies with a target of 50% of their renovation business based on BIM;
Creation of best practice examples for the construction retrofitting sector with benefits for the operators and associated stakeholders (architects, designers, planners, etc.).

Energy Efficiency targets set at EU level by legislation are currently being reviewed. The related SET-Plan rolls out concrete steps how research and innovation could further reach these targets by 2025. However, the current practice to construct nearly zero-energy houses will be insufficient to reach the CO2 emission reduction targets for 2050. Therefore, it is necessary to develop further the concept of ""Plus Energy Houses"", producing more energy than they use. Buildings have long life cycles until they are replaced. Therefore, it is essential to speed up the development of the required technologies.
Scope:
New designs, making use of already developed and validated materials and components and smarter control systems ready to treat vast amounts of data are needed. The surplus of energy should come from renewable sources (geothermal heat, photovoltaics, wind, etc.), obviously optimizing the dynamic character of the energy balance all along the year.
Each proposal should be expected to involve pioneer cities (demonstrations in a multi- storey apartment building situated in each of the 4 climatic zones in Europe). Such buildings should be properly managed and connected to the neighbourhood grid. Proposals should take the lead by levering funding with other energy efficiency schemes, including the private sector. Erecting buildings at such pioneer cities should not encounter regulatory problems. For this reason, the proposal will identify any bottlenecks in the existing regulations and standards concerned by the locations chosen.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects; to enhance user involvement; and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the project.
Activities should start at TRL 5 and achieve TRL 7 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should achieve all of the following:
Similar costs as compared to the 2020 nearly zero-energy buildings as an incentive to erect energy-plus-houses;
Increase of the share of plus-energy houses with the view of 10% market uptake by 2030;
Contribute reducing of CO2 emissions in the residential sector by 88% in 2050 compared to the 1990 levels;
Improved indoor environment leading to higher rate of users' satisfaction based on their demand and behaviour.

Greening of industrial and energy production, storage and distribution[1] by use of CO2 emissions from industrial processes.
The challenge is to sustainably convert CO2 emissions from industrial processes into synthetic fuels and chemicals utilising renewable energy driven processes with novel, highly optimised and energy efficient catalytic systems. This has the potential e.g. to reduce by over 30 % the current ~665 Mt of CO2 emissions per annum[2] related to the Energy Intensive Industries in Europe. However, it is necessary to demonstrate the industrial and economic feasibility of producing synthetic fuels and chemicals by scaling-up the developed technologies to reach industrial production levels and validate the industrial exploitability and circularity.
Scope:
Develop and deploy highly innovative and recyclable catalytic material systems to facilitate the production of synthetic fuels and chemicals from industrial flue gas emissions: mainly CO2 (but also CO and H2), aiming at 50 % increase in the overall efficiency compared to the State-of-the-Art;
Develop innovative, renewable energy driven, catalytic processes, to produce synthetic fuels and chemicals, at a sufficiently large scale to demonstrate its cost effectiveness, while reducing the use of critical raw materials;
Demonstrate the full value chain for industrial production (including SMEs) of synthetic fuels and chemicals, whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions;
Address financial, regulatory, environmental, land and raw material (including critical raw materials) constraints, as well as public acceptance issues and socio-economic impact related to the proposed technological pathways.
Proposals are expected to bring the core technology from TRL 4-5 up to TRL 7 at the end of the project. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 40 million and with a duration of up to 5 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.
Expected Impact:
Industrial scale demonstrator operational by 2026 based on Industrial Symbiosis and novel, highly optimised and energy efficient catalytic systems.
Significant reduction of industrial CO2 emissions (~200Mt p.a. reduction by 2050) with the potential to achieve a carbon intensity below 20g CO2eq/MJ.
Enhance the effectiveness of renewable energy sources (i.e. solar, wind) by enabling the production and transmission of a flexible high energy density storage medium in the form of chemicals and synthetic fuels to be used for specific industry segments (e.g. aviation, chemical, shipping, defence) and validated through Techno-Economic and Life Cycle assessment (TEA/LCA).
Demonstrate and validate the industrial feasibility and cost effectiveness of the technologies, at pilot plant level with a minimum chemical production capacity of 4000 tons per annum, while enhancing Europe’s sustainable competitiveness in accordance with the Commissions Industrial Strategy[3].
Significant indirect impact on air quality and citizen health through the filtering of flue gas emissions from large industrial plants (e.g. energy, cement, chemical, non-ferrous metals and steel).
Foster a cross-sectorial European innovation eco-system to deploy sustainable alternatives to fossil resources and create demonstration capacity for sustainable catalytic systems of superior efficiency towards 2030 and 2050.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
With rising focus on the building sector (e.g. the ‘renovation wave’ initiative of the European Green Deal) in view of the full decarbonisation by 2050, the built environment remains a strategic domain for R&I. The priority is the design and construction of new or retrofitting of existing buildings as zero-emission/zero-pollution[1], positive energy-houses in sustainable green neighbourhoods. There are two major components in this transition. Firstly, a transition in designing and constructing buildings to reduce their embodied emissions and to increase the energy efficiency of their operation; the same applies to retrofitting existing buildings to increase their efficiency. Secondly, a transition to energy positive buildings (producing electricity, covering their heating and cooling needs and contributing to the energy grid stability) with sustainable, renewable energy technologies. These two components are closely linked, since greater building efficiency can reduce demand for heating and cooling and allow a greater range of zero emission technologies to become viable. It also means, reducing demand through effective building designs, including those that are adapted to their local environments (bioclimatic architecture conditions) and use. Spreading such building concept allows the creation of green neighbourhood “living labs” (including social housing and non-residential buildings such as hospitals, schools, public buildings, commercial buildings, etc.) with additional urban functionalities (e.g. shared EV charging facilities).
Scope:
Proposals are expected to deliver at least two (residential and non-residential, new and/or retrofitted) large-scale, real-life demonstrations of promising technology, process and social innovations, in different regions of Europe. The demonstrations should address the following aspects:
Scalable design of green, positive energy neighbourhoods well embedded in the spatial, economic, technical, environmental, regulatory and social context of the demonstration sites.
Energy and resource efficient, seamless industrial construction/renovation workflows from design to eventual offsite manufacturing, installation and post-construction monitoring:
With recycling/reuse of construction materials (or industrial by-products) or reduction of the amount of materials and components used, in order to reduce the embodied energy of buildings;
Demonstrating high replicability, reduced maintenance costs and long-term performance, as well as socio-environmental performance (e.g. air quality/natural ventilation, natural lighting, etc.) and potential for adaptation, reuse or deconstruction in the future;
Ensuring that proposed solutions do not influence negatively the fire and seismic safety of the buildings;
Minimizing disruption for building’s occupants and the time spent on site;
Delivering post-construction/renovation monitoring of both operational energy performance (minimizing design-built performance gap) and durability of the construction/renovation components.
Sustainable and highly energy-efficient building designs adapted to local environments and climatic conditions, including active-passive solutions, with:
Digital and EGNSS[2] based methods of design and construction, smart monitoring and tracking of building and renovation processes (e.g. Building Information Modelling, digital twins and augmented reality, robotics, etc.);
Innovative and more energy efficient Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) converting the building envelope into electricity-producing surfaces, while satisfying building functions in addition to architectural and aesthetic considerations.
Sustainable, innovative zero-emission and more cost and energy efficient, renewable energy generation in the buildings combined with urban service facilities (e.g. charging facilities) and heating-ventilation-air conditioning (HVAC) solutions :
Renewable power generation and H&C systems (e.g. highly performant Photovoltaic solutions adapted to the conditions of use; BAPV where BIPV is not an option; micro-CHP);
HVAC solutions (e.g. reversible heat pumps with refrigerants that are not greenhouse gases, or less developed clean heating options such as hydrogen).
Energy storage systems (e.g. using second life batteries from electric vehicles) with bidirectional charging functionalities, that do not limit the use of living space (e.g. neighbourhood optimized storage including management systems for optimal integration, flexibility and interoperability with the grid).
Highly energy-efficient building operation at reduced maintenance costs and long-term performance with the help of digital technologies to optimise energy generation, consumption, storage and flexibility at neighbourhood scale, as well as digital solutions to increase the usability, energy efficiency and secure operation of building systems and appliances, ensuring optimal comfort for users and a healthier living environment:
Optimal dynamic matching of on-site renewable energy generation and building/neighbourhood consumption; integrated demand-response, considering also non-energy benefits (e.g. occupant security; indoor/outdoor air quality, etc.);
Smart home services, advanced automated controls, i.e., smart meters, smart water control, smart EV charging, smart elevators, smart security etc.; based on inclusive design, understanding the occupants preferred usage of the building and harmonising the building - occupants interaction;
Integration between building energy management systems/building automation control systems, renewable electricity/energy generation, storage, urban service facilities and the grid;
Potential for local flexibility to be aggregated and bundled; possibility to trade and commoditise energy flexibility creating new services and revenue streams for building owners/tenants;
Citizen awareness raising activities linked to green neighbourhood “living labs” (led by “green schools” where relevant), to facilitate social innovation, promote education and training for sustainability, conducive to competences and positive behaviour/good habits for a resource efficient and environmentally respectful energy use.
Coordination on standards and regulatory aspects to ensure operational efficiency of buildings and HVAC technologies also addressing the design-built performance gap.
The objective of the demonstrations is to test, in view of scaling up and wide replication, the proposed innovations across the whole value chain (from planning and design through manufacturing and construction to end use, including all relevant players, governance and financing institutions, planners, owners, architects, engineers, contractors, facility managers, tenants, social partners, etc.). The objective is also to adapt this value chain to new operation patterns resulting from the innovations (new business models and services, new usages, changed behaviour). Therefore, the validation of the market and consumer uptake potential should be carried out in the form of real life “living-labs” and under conditions that are open to innovation and promoting affordable access to housing. On this purpose, the project will set up (or use existing) innovation clusters in different regions of Europe, where relevant with a link to other initiatives (e.g. R&I partnerships). Such innovation clusters need to include the local/regional/national value chain(s), to demonstrate, evaluate and ultimately replicate the innovative solutions in different environment and market conditions, with due consideration of social, business and policy drivers. This will also ensure the validation of the innovations for different building types - residential (e.g. social housing) and non-residential (e.g. hospitals, schools, public buildings) - and various climatic zones.
Proposals are expected to bring the technologies from TRL 5/6 to TRL 7/8 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 to 20 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actors along the construction and renovation value chains are qualified and have integrated the innovative technologies in their business models and operations. Strong innovation clusters are able to accelerate the spread of green building and renovation concepts to provide momentum to the ‘renovation wave’ that will be politically underpinned.
When compared to the state of the art the innovative technical solutions further developed and demonstrated by n the projects are expected to bring the impacts listed below:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Demonstration sites that go beyond nearly-zero energy building performance;
High energy performance (nearly zero-energy level within the meaning of Directive 2010/31/EU for retrofitted / positive-energy level buildings for new constructions);
Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions towards zero (in tCO2-eq/year) for the total life-cycle compared to current situation shown through cradle-to-cradle Life Cycle Assessment;
Reduction of the embodied energy in buildings by 50 % without concessions with respect to energy consumption and comfort;
Reduction of air pollutants towards zero (in kg/year) for the total life-cycle compared to current situation shown through cradle-to-cradle Life Cycle Assessment;
Demonstration of high potential for replicability using new or existing innovation clusters incorporating the whole value chain;
Shortened construction/retrofitting time and cost by at least 30%, in order to allow market uptake and social affordability;
Improved final indoor environment quality by at least 30% and reduction of dust and noise during retrofitting by at least 30%, leading to higher rate of users’ satisfaction, demonstrated according to the relevant CEN standard (or equivalent).
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A clear commitment of the European Green Deal is that “transport should become drastically less polluting”, highlighting in particular the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in aviation and waterborne transport. In aviation, traffic volumes are expected to increase significantly by 2050 and the sector is already generating 14% of the EU GHG emissions from transport. At the same time, waterborne transport accounts for approximately 90% of global trade and 13% of EU transport GHG emissions, while also experiencing continuous growth. In this context, airports, maritime and inland ports play a major role, both as inter-connection points in the respective transport networks, but also as major multimodal nodes, logistics hubs and commercial sites, linking with other transport modes, hinterland connections and integrated with cities. As such, green airports and ports, as multimodal hubs in the post COVID-19 era for sustainable and smart mobility have a great potential to immediately contribute to start driving the transition towards GHG-neutral aviation, shipping and wider multimodal mobility already by 2025. This topic therefore addresses innovative concepts and solutions for airports and ports, in order to urgently reduce transport GHG emissions and increase their contribution to mitigating climate change.
Scope:
Building on best practices (technological, non-technological and social), as well as ongoing projects and planned initiatives in European airports and ports, actions should address the activities EITHER under area A) Green Airports OR under area B) Green Ports. Proposals should clearly indicate which area they are covering.
Area A: Green Airports
Actions should perform large-scale, real-life high TRL (6 or above) demonstrations of green airports, addressing all of the following four headings, collectively describing the various airport aspects to be considered: 1) Transport, 2) Terminal, 3) Energy and 4) Cross-cutting aspects.
1. Transport
Actions should cover all of the following aspects:
access and multimodal connections to the airport (e.g. from cities or other nodes);
from the airport terminal to the aircraft (airside);
at the airport landside (logistics, ground handlings and operations, as well as green energy production/supply of sustainable alternative fuels or electricity).
Actions should also cover at least three of the following, as appropriate:
demonstrating low-emission energy use (electrification or sustainable alternative fuels) for aircraft, airports, other/connected and automated vehicles accessing or operating at airports (e.g. road vehicles, rolling stock, drones), as well as for public transport and carpooling, with re-charging/re-fuelling stations and use of incentives;
showcasing the use of innovative de-icing and anti-icing procedures and infrastructures;
applying innovative digital and EU satellite-based solutions, including new tools and traffic optimisation mechanisms for multimodal access, passenger and freight flows into and out of the airport, as well as between airports, facilitating airport access and reducing traffic from/to the city or other nodes;
promoting the development of production facilities for sustainable alternative fuels, as well as the necessary underlying infrastructure (for distribution, fuel handling logistics and blending operations) to facilitate the conversion of waste to sustainable alternative fuels and the delivery of the fuels to the airport, for small and medium airports, and scalable to large airports, therefore allowing deployment at a significant number of airports;
promoting intermodal mobility (e.g. in the context of mobility/logistics as a service or transport-on-demand), including efficient rail interconnection solutions and innovative train-airport station concepts;
conceiving, developing and preparing for future implementation of a new autonomous, integrated and operational EU Clearing House for Sustainable Kerosene (EU-CHSK). The EU-CHSK would undertake testing for new value chains of renewable kerosene in Europe, involving relevant laboratories for the analyses of fuels and facilities to carry out testing in jet engines, in compliance with existing or newly developed standards.
2. Terminal
Actions should cover at least two of the following, as appropriate:
demonstrating integration of new solutions with operations, green and smart logistics and infrastructures;
developing the built environment (construction/demolition) using more ecologically-friendly materials and processes and incorporating these improvements in the procurement processes to sustainably decrease the ecological footprint;
improving the energy efficiency of buildings; optimising services such as lighting, heating, natural ventilation and air conditioning (taking into account strict public health criteria), water/energy usage and efficiency;
enhancing biodiversity, green land planning and use, as well as circular economy (e.g. repair, reuse and recycling of buildings and waste, in the context of zero-waste concepts).
3. Energy
Actions should cover at least two of the following, as appropriate:
addressing the entire energy value chain from supply to use: demonstrating energy efficient facilities for green energy production (e.g. electricity, advanced biofuels, synthetic kerosene, mixture SAF/Jet A1, green hydrogen) to power/electrify the built environment and infrastructure, transport and airport ground operations;
envisaging industrial scale pilot advanced biofuels refineries or retooling of existing fuel refineries, as a means of producing sustainable alternative fuels and generating additional heat and power in an efficient manner and minimal environmental impact;
identifying effective incentives to address challenges in the sustainable alternative fuels system (e.g. fuel producers, fuel distributors, airport operators, airline operators) and promoting the penetration of sustainable alternative fuels within the aviation sector;
assessing the scalability of solutions – e.g. enabling sustainable alternative fuel producers to cover investment risks and promote advanced technology, while securing buy-in of end users (air operators).
4. Cross-cutting aspects
Actions should cover at least three of the following, as appropriate:
air quality (indoor, outdoor, including decontamination from microbiological pathogens) and noise trade-off;
impact on the existing legal framework covering operational and environmental aspects, eco-labelling, certifications (robust certification and green standards setting) and measurement, reporting and verification (MRV);
use of ICT and, among others, EU satellite-based solutions to effectively manage resources and assets, including management of information and production of knowledge, taking into account all the related safety and security aspects of the solutions developed and proposed;
sustainable evolution of airports, also in the context of circular economy (e.g. activities linked to aircraft decommissioning and collection/sorting of recyclable waste), considering institutional and governance aspects, ownership, regulation, performance indicators and balance of force between regulators, airlines and airport operators;
feasibility of a market-based instrument to prevent/reduce Food Loss and Waste (FLW) and to valorise a business case of transformation of FLW into new bio-based products. This includes FLW measurement and monitoring methodologies and the subsequent mapping of FLW total volume at stake in the considered airport;
assessing non-technological framework conditions, such as market mechanisms and potential regulatory actions in the short and medium term, which can provide financial/operational incentives and legal certainty for implementing low-emission solutions;
developing and promoting new multi-actor governance arrangements that address the interactions between all airport-related stakeholders, including authorities, aircraft owners and operators, local communities, civil society organisations and city, regional or national planning departments.
Area B: Green Ports
Actions should perform large-scale, real-life high TRL (6 or above) demonstrations of sustainable maritime and inland ports, addressing the first aspect below and at least five of the following ones :
demonstrating integrated low-emission energy supply and production at ports (e.g. electricity, green hydrogen, advanced biofuels and bioliquids) and supply systems (on-shore or off-shore), with storage, distribution and power/re-charging/sustainable alternative fuel re-fueling infrastructure for ships and other vehicles operating at/to/from ports, as well as for other uses (e.g. port equipment/machinery, on-shore power supply systems for vessels mooring in the port, etc.);
demonstrating sustainability and innovation beyond energy supply and demand at ports, particularly the integration with green and smart logistics and operations at/to/from ports, energy-efficient buildings, innovative construction, dredging and infrastructure activities, effective and green land use;
demonstrating seamless and highly efficient logistics operations, for integrated sea/river-port-hinterland connections (e.g. between sea/river, rail and road), to enable modal shifts and system-wide door-to-door multimodal passenger mobility and freight transport;
performing pilot activities to showcase the positive environmental effects of digitalisation (incl. EU satellite-based solutions) in ports, particularly with clean (e.g. electrified/hydrogen) connected and automated vehicles and cranes, as well as intelligent port systems and dynamic vessel traffic flows for improved routing and scheduling, to minimise ship time at port, enabling efficient and automated logistics chains and multimodal inter-connections;
delivering new tools and optimisation mechanisms for multimodal access, passenger and freight flows into and out of the port, as well as between ports, facilitating port access and reducing traffic from/to the city or other nodes;
assessing non-technological framework conditions, such as market mechanisms and potential regulatory actions in the short and medium term, which can provide financial/operational incentives and legal certainty for implementing low-emission solutions (e.g. considering first-mover advantage, best-equipped-best-served principles and port market share effects);
developing and promoting new multi-actor governance arrangements that address the interactions between all port-related stakeholders, including port authorities, ship owners, local communities, civil society organisations and city, regional or national planning departments, in order to accelerate the production and use of sustainable energy;
delivering a Master Plan for the future Green Port, with a bold vision and a roadmap with milestones to achieve GHG neutral shipping and minimal pollution in maritime and inland port areas (incl. ships in and approaching port) by 2030, 2040 and 2050; as well as addressing the associated investment/cost implications (incl. operational and capital expenditures). This master plan should also address:
a wider socio-economic perspective, covering sustainable and smart mobility, technical, operational, economic, environmental and social aspects, relevant to shaping the green ports of the future and their integration with other sustainable transport modes, the hinterland, cities and urban mobility;
solutions with the highest potential for emission reduction at ports, focusing on CO2 and noxious pollutant emissions (SOx, NOx and particulates), as well as water pollution and noise, but also on improving biodiversity, the soil and the aquatic environment, while considering climate change effects (e.g. sea/river-level rise, new tourism patterns, etc.);
analysis of the various alternatives for the provision of power supply at the port, such as fixed land energy grid vs. mobile power production and supply (e.g. LNG generators/containers) and mobile storage, for instance through the use of barges or trucks bringing energy/batteries, etc.;
assessment of whether existing fossil fuel, LNG or other/chemical infrastructures in the broader port areas could be used to facilitate the transition towards low-emission shipping and bunkering of carbon neutral fuels;
a holistic sustainable port design concept, leveraging green construction, demolition and dredging activities, with energy-efficient or renovated buildings, optimising land and sea/river use, improving biodiversity and circular economy;
scalable solutions that can be replicated/gradually scaled-up to larger or scaled-down to smaller ports, together with the demonstration of their environmental sustainability and technical, operational, and economic viability;
governance, business, deployment models and plans, including internal/external costs;
collaboration models across multiple stakeholders, paving the ground for large-scale deployment of the demonstrated innovative solutions across European ports;
a comprehensive report of all project findings in detail, including the identified proposed suitable pathways for European ports to achieve GHG-neutrality, by use of standardised tools for assessing the comparative emission reduction of different ports;
a handbook on how to move from planning, to implementation, replication and scaling-up the deployment of the demonstrated solutions, for different sizes and locations of ports across Europe.
Applicable to both Area A: Green Airports and Area B: Green Ports
Actions for both areas (Green Airports and Green Ports), in addition to addressing the aspects described above should, where appropriate, incorporate field performance monitoring with a view to assessing the effectiveness of the deployable solutions. This should be determined by measuring the performance difference (for comparable activity levels) between the initial status, considered before the innovative solutions are applied (baseline), and the status at a point in time at 2-3 years into the project, after a number of the solutions produced by the project have been applied.
Actions should also provide a quantified assessment of the expected improvement in airport or port energy consumption, as well as in greenhouse gas emissions and air quality.
In order to enhance synergies and impact, proposals should foresee a work package for cooperation with other actions in the same area and earmark appropriate resources for coordination, communication efforts and relevant research work with other projects and initiatives.
Each consortium should include a leading “Lighthouse” airport or port, which will demonstrate the novel concepts and solutions and a further three (at most) “Fellow” airports or ports that will be actively associated in helping to define and incorporate their specificities in the more general approach and solutions, follow closely the demonstration actions and are committed to implement the best practices identified and results produced by the project. For Green Ports, each consortium should include at least one inland port. All consortia should also be multidisciplinary in nature by including partners with the appropriate complementary knowledge and skills (e.g. industry, consultancy, airport/port authorities, academia). All participating airports or ports must be from different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 and 25 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Typically, projects should have a duration of 48 to 60 months. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts or durations. A maximum of 20% of the requested EU contribution should be for the Fellow airports or ports.
Grants will be awarded to proposals according to the overall ranking list. However, in order to ensure a balanced portfolio of supported actions, at least the two highest-ranked proposals in each area will be funded (i.e. two proposals for area A) Green Airports and another two for area B) Green Ports), provided they attain all thresholds.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
accelerated deployment of sustainable alternative fuels (including advanced biofuels), green hydrogen and electromobility in transport, as well as sustainable energy supply and storage and waste heat recovery in airports and ports;
clean energy/fuel production and distribution (particularly green hydrogen and electricity) and increased alternative (bio-) fuel supply, with re-fueling and re-charging capabilities;
green airports and ports as multimodal hubs, optimising passenger and freight flows for low emission mobility, in a context of much stricter public health criteria;
energy-efficient and green airport and port operations and buildings, green and smart logistics, integration with other low-emission transport modes (in particular rail) and promoting effective modal shifts;
reduced aviation, waterborne and other transport emissions, as well as improved air quality, biodiversity, contribution to the circular economy and reduction of noise at airports and ports;
reduced emissions for cities and urban mobility, as well as improved city integration for airports and ports;
clear commitments and contributions to Europe-wide take up of technological, non-technological and socially innovative solutions during and beyond the project are expected, which could be in the form of follow-up actions, for instance supported by EU’s Connecting Europe Facility or other funding programmes;
significant, direct and immediate contribution to the achievement of the European Green Deal, as well as other EU transport policy objectives (including TEN-T), while strengthening the competitiveness of the European transport sector.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A recent Eurobarometer survey (2020) showed that a large majority of respondents are worried about the impact on their health of chemicals present in everyday products. There is also solid scientific evidence substantiating health and environmental concerns related to chemicals. The European Green Deal includes a commitment to a zero-pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment. In this context, it specifically mentions the need to rapidly address the risks posed by hazardous chemicals and, more specifically, very persistent chemicals.
Pollution from persistent and mobile chemicals is often a systemic problem, as it is driven by factors closely related to the prevailing ways of production and consumption and is reinforced by missing appropriate technical solutions, including (bio)remediation and monitoring techniques for the environment (including the marine environment). These chemicals also pose challenges for regulatory authorities to develop or enforce effective policies.
An example of these very persistent chemicals is per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of thousands of manmade chemicals that are widely used in various consumer and industrial products (e.g. water- and stain repellent textiles, fire-fighting foams, plastics, food contact materials and cosmetics) and to which citizens and the environment are exposed. They are an increasing concern as they are persistent in the environment, very mobile, toxic and can bioaccumulate. For these reasons, they are found everywhere in the environment and their concentration increases over time, creating additional risks for human health and ecosystems. There are examples of contamination by PFAS of water and soil in most EU countries, which are costly or in some cases impossible to remediate. The overall costs to society from PFAS alone as an example are estimated by one source to be € 52-84bn across Europe (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019)[1], which is likely to be an underestimate, as it includes only a limited range of health effects (high cholesterol, impaired immune system, and cancer). Some studies have shown negative effects of PFAS on the immune system, including a reduced response to vaccines. Similar effects are known also in connection to other kinds of persistent chemicals. This is of concern considering the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Scope:
Taking into account latest policy needs and developments, this call topic aims at establishing new knowledge, exploring the feasibility of new or improved technologies and demonstrating innovative solutions to protect health, environment and natural resources from persistent and mobile chemicals. Selected projects are expected to advance our knowledge on health impacts and environmental effects and to address and preferably prevent a specific pollution problem involving contamination of environmental resources (such as soil, sediments, air, food and drinking water). The solutions developed should lead to cost-effective prevention, monitoring and to, as a last resort, mitigation or elimination of the issues (e.g. mitigation or remediation efforts in particularly affected geographic areas). They should also lead to better understanding of environmental fate and help proactively prevent negative impacts from persistent and mobile chemicals (and, where relevant, their precursors) on humans and the environment. The projects may include appropriate technologies, business, governance and social innovation aspects and the demonstration of innovative solutions in a relevant environment (TRL 4-6). In particular, projects may consider analytical methods and monitoring, enabling to quantify entire groups of persistent and mobile chemicals in food, soil or drinking water. This would allow achieving a higher level of consumer protection, as such grouping methods are essential for regulating groups of harmful substances that have similar structures.
The successful projects should target persistent and mobile chemicals and include elements (one or several), such as
gain insight to the uses, sources and environmental fate of persistent and mobile chemicals
development of new cost-effective high-resolution methods to analyse and model the presence of persistent and mobile chemicals in products/materials and in different media;
environmental and human (bio)monitoring[2] of persistent and mobile chemicals;
gathering of toxicity and toxico-kinetic information (including animal-free approaches such as in vitro and in silico approaches) in order to allow characterising risks to human health and ecosystems, including at low environmental levels and combined/cumulative exposure;
detection and identification of specific pollution problems and their sources[3]
research and development of (bio)remediation technologies of soil and water (including sources of drinking water) contaminated by persistent and mobile substances and their precursors;
development and improvement of models to predict and assess long-term trends and risks for persistent mobile substances and propose preventive solutions
development of best practices for the management and treatment of waste, soil and water containing persistent and mobile substances, in line with the ambitions of the Circular Economy Action Plan[4].
Proposed solutions should be suitable for real life challenges, environmentally sustainable, cost-effective and easily implementable to encourage their uptake. Therefore, close consultation or collaboration with potential end-users of the expected results during the project lifetime is recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 12 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Provide a foundation for prevention and mitigation solutions based on better understanding the sources and distribution of the targeted chemicals, access to models of their environmental fate and degradation pathways and improved understanding of relevance for human and environmental health of the problem of emerging and persistent pollution;
Provide solutions and support decision making for addressing large-scale diffuse contamination of water and soil with persistent and mobile chemicals (including for combinations of pollutants) in an integrated manner;
Contribute to achieving a toxic-free environment through solutions for better load reduction, (bio)remediation and detection technologies, including real time monitoring approaches;
Improve risk assessment to facilitate optimal risk management and preventive solutions;
Support policy development, regulatory action and risk communication with FAIR[5] data of regulatory relevance;
Support actions deriving from several EU documents on persistent and mobile chemicals[6], the upcoming Zero Pollution Action Plan and the aims of the new Circular Economy Action Plan[7] to minimise the presence of substances that pose problems to human and environmental health.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Under ‘Towards a zero-pollution ambition for a toxic free environment’, the European Green Deal will propose a new Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, aiming at better protection of both humans and the environment against hazardous chemicals. In addition, there is growing concern about the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment[1].
Humans, wildlife and domestic animals are exposed to combinations of different chemicals via air, water (including the marine environment), food and feed, consumer products, materials and goods. The scientific understanding of combination effects has progressed in recent years and approaches for risk assessment and management of unintentional mixtures and combined exposures to chemicals are available.
In parallel with the development and implementation of regulatory approaches, there is a need to improve the scientific knowledge base. Current knowledge shows that exposures to combinations of chemicals pose risks to ecosystems and human health that may not be sufficiently managed under existing regulations. There is a need to advance regulatory science to provide policy-makers and risk assessors with validated and practically applicable approaches, methods and tools and to study the effectiveness and efficiency of different policy approaches. The effects of exposure of humans and the environment to combinations of chemicals should also be further explored.
Scope:
This topic calls for applied research studies, demonstrating how new tools and methodological approaches from regulatory science that are workable in a regulatory context and are based on the latest scientific evidence, can be applied to identify, quantify and prevent harmful co-exposures to industrial[2] chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
The applicants can address some or all of the following:
Development of innovative tools and analytical methods to detect and measure complex mixtures in the various environmental compartments[3];
Comparisons of different possible regulatory approaches to manage unintentional chemical mixtures and co-exposures, regarding effectiveness (improved protection of health and the environment), workability, cost-effectiveness and benefits to society and business;
Estimations of the degree to which current and possible future regulatory practices/approaches underestimate (or possibly occasionally overestimate) risks related to chemicals exposure (based on particular case studies, modelling and overall estimations);
Develop and apply modelling, statistical approaches and other relevant methods to identify and study the health impacts on human populations and the environment of exposures to combinations of different chemicals, e.g. through linking results from exposure monitoring with observed health effects;
Scientific case studies to identify safety margins for specific unintentional exposures to combination of chemicals to protect human and ecosystems health, while taking into account chronic exposures over longer time scales;
The possible effects on humans, in particular on vulnerable sub-populations, from combined (chronic) exposure to low levels of pharmaceuticals via the environment, taking account the inherent pharmacological properties and the potential for combined effects from co-exposures with other chemicals;
Combining and analysing EU data sources to generate insights on real-life and potential exposure combinations, typical exposure routes and uses;
Development, improvement and validation of models for predicting (chronic) exposure to combinations of chemicals, which can be applied in a premarket stage (risk assessment, risk management measures, including, e.g. authorisation and restriction of chemicals) and possibly already at the design phase of chemicals and materials as well as retrospectively (e.g. in the setting of environmental quality objectives).
Expected Impact:
Scientific evidence to enable prevention and/or mitigation of co-exposure to pharmaceuticals and industrial1 chemicals in the environment and the technosphere.
Support the implementation of existing risk assessment and risk management approaches to reduce the most critical exposures, including the setting of limit values for exposures taking into account co-exposures..
Support the assessment of new regulatory approaches such as, e.g. Mixture Assessment Factors
Support activities on combined exposures as relevant for the Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment2 and as to be defined in the forthcoming Chemical Strategy for Sustainability[4]
Selected projects under this topic are strongly encouraged to continuously share information and participate to joint activities to optimise synergies to address policy-relevant knowledge gaps.

","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Noise and emissions from transport affect seriously people's health and environmental ecosystems requiring the implementation of mitigation measures to achieve a higher reduction in all transport modes. The fast development of technologies that facilitate connectivity of innovative sensors, -both on-board and on the side of the infrastructure- could allow real-time monitoring and control of transport noise and emissions. Current applications of different mobile systems and measurement methodologies make comparison of data rather difficult. The development of harmonized measurement methodologies will increase the reliability of collected data and the credibility of the consequent awareness/mitigation procedures. Systems embedded in the transport infrastructure can help in identifying vehicles not respecting prescribed limits and would either allow the operator to be informed swiftly of the environmental deficiencies of the vehicle, or would enable authorities to identify and prevent polluting vehicles from entering, hindering their access to specified low-emission zones, thus mitigating the effects of the non-respect of tolerance limits.
The integration in the infrastructure of absorbing materials and the utilization of negative-emissions solutions can also contribute to the reduction of the negative effects of emissions and noise.
Scope:
Proposals should address all the following aspects:
Development of equipment for integration into infrastructure that would be able to detect and identify (plate recognition) in real-time vehicles exceeding the limits of noise (Db(A)) and emissions (CO2, NOx, PM);
Development of related I2V systems aimed at informing the transgressor of the emissions/noise limits being exceeded and preventing access to delimited low-emission zones;
Development of automated tolling systems that take into account the level of emissions from individual vehicles;
Development of new materials and negative-emissions solutions for infrastructure application, apt to mitigate noise and emissions.
Road and rail networks are primarily addressed, but research should not exclude solutions to reduce nuisance coming also from air and water transport.
Potential negative effects from fixed sensors on human health should be carefully considered and avoided.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.[1]
Expected Impact:
Development of measures aimed at reducing the negative effects of noise and emissions. Increased monitoring and detection of transport unacceptable levels of noise and emissions; identification of transgressing vehicles and possible invitation to appropriate revision; limiting access to sensitive zones (e.g. urban centres). Development of technologies to be applied for better calculation of externalities and consequent charging methods. The application of solutions should bring to a reduction of at least 30% in emissions and 20% in noise in targeted zones based on the measured level at the beginning of the project.

","28 June 2018","Specific Challenge:
Batteries are still a hampering factor for a clear market acceptance of Electric Vehicles as they are still not able to deliver the required performance considering driving range, fast charging capacity and safety for a reasonable price. This is mainly due to the limitations of the current Li-ion cell technologies especially in terms of safety – due to the use of liquid, flammable electrolytes – and energy density, which approaches their fundamental limits. New solutions have to be developed that will resolve the above mentioned cost and performance constraints of Electric Vehicle (EV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) batteries, for a real breakthrough in the deployment and market share of these vehicles. New successful technologies will strengthen the whole battery cell related value chain and will help to re-establish European competitiveness also in battery cell production.
Scope:
New or significantly improved materials and/or chemistries have to be developed to optimise the battery cell and its components, with features clearly beyond the state-of the-art technologies that are currently used in commercial cells for automotive applications. These could be based, for example, on high voltage, Nickel- or Lithium-rich cathode materials; Lithium-Silicon, Lithium-Sulphur, Lithium-metal, or metal-air systems; new polymer or ceramic electrolytes, or any other technology that would be able to generate the required impact (including the so called ""advanced Lithium-ion"" and ""post-Lithium-ion"" technologies).
Proposals should in particular investigate phenomena and problems at the interfaces of the components of the battery cell electrode systems that are often not well understood. They should also solve the safety issues encountered by the current Li-ion chemistries, including thermal runaway (e.g. through the use of solid-state electrolytes instead of flammable, liquid electrolytes). Knowledge on the ageing processes in order to know the cell parameters for eventual second life use should be as well gained.
Production aspects should be considered during the prototyping phase. Simulation and modelling for the development phase as well as life cycle assessment, and specially-tailored test procedures for validating the new technology should be included. Scaling-up for production will not be covered under the topic.
Special attention should be given to sustainable materials, the circular economy and eventual second life applications, and as far as possible to materials that are easily available in Europe, in order to avoid market dependence, e.g. of critical raw materials. Recycling should be inherently possible on large scale, thus enabling overall costs that will not hamper market acceptance.
The following aspects should also be considered: prepare for developments in European standardisation and regulation; gain technological and market advantage of a new competitive European technology. Synergies with the stationary battery production sector could be explored.
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The performance levels of the proposed solution(s) should be in line with those specified in the relevant parts of the SET-Plan.[1]
Reduction of greenhouse gases and air pollutants through the enhanced deployment of electric vehicles enabled by high performing, cost efficient and “user friendly” batteries;
Development of a new, market competitive European battery cell chemistry and materials technology that will allow reduction of dependence from foreign supply, and build the knowledge base for the creation of a competitive European automotive cell production;
Strong improvement on the technical performance of EV batteries. Gravimetric energy density at cell level is expected to reach 400-450 Wh/kg by 2030, while power density should be beyond 700 W/kg;
Significant reduction of recharging times compared to current technologies, e.g. by enabling very high charging currents or other design-based solutions, avoiding at the same time battery materials degradation and losses in the longevity as it is currently the case after fast charging;
Cyclability should be suitable for automotive long term application, and ideally reach 5000 cycles for second life-use batteries by 2030;
The new solution is expected to be market competitive in 5-10 years and, by 2030, its costs should be below 75 €/kWh at battery pack level;
Recyclability should be guaranteed with recycling efficiency beyond 50% reaching economic viability (that has to be demonstrated in the project).
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

","03 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
The realisation of the European goals of increased energy efficiency, reduction in CO2 emissions and the circular economy require novel ways of using, harvesting and storing energy. Smart materials and material systems/structures have already demonstrated the potential to reduce energy consumption as well as harvest, generate and store energy. However, implementation has been limited due to the materials' operational reliability as well as issues of recyclability and dependence on rare elements. In addition, cost concerns or lack of efficient manufacturing processes prohibit the wider implementation of such technologies. The next step is the implementation of these technologies in a wide range of commercial applications allowing the exploitation of the characteristics of smart materials. As the application of smart materials and developments in sensor technologies are dominated by SMEs in the EU, extending their innovation potential for smart materials applications is important for maintaining their market position and has a significant impact in improving EU competitiveness.
Scope:
Proposals should cover the following:
The development of new materials and material combinations with energy harvesting and storage capabilities (e.g. lead-free piezoelectric based devices for energy generation and energy storing automotive structural components or magnetic materials systems);
Clearly demonstrate reduction of around 25% in overall materials and processing costs relative to the state of the art and how the implementation of those technologies would be achieved;
Demonstrate the recyclability and reliability of new smart materials, as well as a reduction in the dependence on rare elements;
Integrate sensor technologies (e.g. MEMS based sensor concepts) and the potential linkage with the Internet of Things (IoT);
Assess market perspectives and patents as well as standardisation;

New materials facilitating technology systems for sustainable energy supply allowing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% based on lifecycle analysis;
Reduction of hazardous waste by 50% through efficient manufacturing practices and/or materials selection;
Development of new technologies, applications and services providing direct support for the wider implementation of the DSM and IoT, (e.g. enable the development of wireless sensor networks, or, deployment of energy harvesting powered sensor nodes to monitor remote locations);

So, solar panels and wind generators do not deliver energy when no sun is shining or no wind is blowing. Batteries may not be the best solution to face all energy storage needs, due to cost, safety and environmental issues. Other technologies have to be developed that can respond to these needs, and their readiness for market deployment has to be shown. Specific materials for these technologies have to be developed. Price competitiveness and environmental aspects have to be considered, as well as economic viability.
Scope:
Non battery-based storage technologies, such as Power to Gas, Power to chemicals and power to liquids (based e.g. on ethanol, methanol or ammoniac), or compressed air energy storage CAES, can be suitable solutions for different energy storage needs.
These new technologies will need new or considerably improved materials, with increased performance and reduced total costs with respect to currently used ones. Cost reductions may result e.g. from new materials, in combination with new design/architecture (when applicable or suitable) or reduced service and maintenance needs.
With respect to power to gas and power to fuels or chemicals, innovation will result for instance from the improvement of electrolysers. Advanced materials solutions may be high-capacity, durable proton exchange membranes and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolysers for hydrogen production; or cost efficient materials for tanks for hydrogen storage.
Most technologies are still in an experimental phase and have to be prepared for industrial deployment. Price competitiveness and environmental aspects have to be analysed.
The materials should show its economic viability, also considering the cost related to the necessary overall infrastructure.
Special attention should be given to sustainable materials, the circular economy and eventual second life applications, and to materials that are easily available in Europe, in order to avoid market dependence e.g. of critical raw materials. Recycling should be inherently possible on large scale, permitting overall costs that will not hamper market acceptance.
Materials for thermal storage and storage for hydropower are excluded from this call, as well as the development of fuel cells and supercapacitors.
Activities should start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The performance levels of the proposed solution(s) should be in line with those specified in the relevant parts of the SET-Plan.[1]
Improving technical and economic competitiveness of EU stationary storage production suitable to store large amount of energy;
By enabling low-carbon energy production, help to reach climate goals and CO2 reduction levels as per international agreements as EU 2020 and 2050 targets and COP21; improving indirectly health of EU society;
Significant improvements in the levelised costs of energy while maintaining or improving other properties of the storage solution.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

","14 May 2020","Specific Challenge:
The next generation of large offshore wind energy generators and tidal power generators will help to reach climate goals and CO2 reduction levels and are likely to secure Europe’s technical and economic competitiveness. Accordingly, new challenges related to materials or multi-material architectures must be addressed, to increase operational performance and allow an appreciable reduction of the overall cost of offshore energy generation, taking into account capital expenditure as well as, running and maintenance costs.
The challenge is therefore to improve the operational performance of the next generation of offshore wind energy generators (larger than 8MW) and tidal stream power generators through better performance of their functional (e.g. wind energy generator rotor blades) and/or structural components (e.g. floating or bottom fixed base structure).
Scope:
Develop new and/or improved material solutions or improvements by a combination of materials, technologies and design of structural and functional components. This should result in one or more of the following properties:
Increased durability and reliability and reduced maintenance requirements (e.g. self-cleaning and/or self-healing properties, increased corrosion and/or erosion resistance, increased fatigue resistance);
Smart material functionality and/or the possibility to use embedded sensors for online monitoring of performance and/or structural health monitoring (detection of environmental impact and/or structural and mechanical status);
Lightweight (mainly applicable to wind energy);
Increased recyclability with respect to current state-of-the-art;
Materials should be easy to repair.
Consider advanced manufacturing technologies for the reduction of manufacturing costs applicable to already developed materials and take into account costs of (multi)-materials production as well as the design and manufacturability of the new system or product as a whole. Synergies with projects selected under topic DT-FOF-10-2020 Pilot lines for large-part high-precision manufacturing is encouraged.
Develop and validate suitable models of predictive materials degradation (mechanical and/or environmental), including Life Cycle Assessment and an economic analysis to demonstrate the viability of the solutions.
The materials solutions should profit from existing European advantages in the value chain, such as existing production of high-level materials and/or production technologies;
Consider European standardisation and regulation.
Possible materials for wind generators include for example, polymer based fibre reinforced (glass, carbon aramid, etc.) composites, nanoparticle filled composites, materials with embedded superhard nanoparticles, metal-plastic systems, high strength steels, high strength lightweight alloys, (e.g titanium, aluminium etc.) with improved efficiency and cost.
Materials for the development of gearboxes and related parts of the powertrain are excluded from the scope of this topic, as well as Materials for wave energy generators.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Significant reduction of life cycle costs while maintaining or improving other performance properties of the solution (e.g. obtained by significant reduction of maintenance cost);
Development of materials with optimised materials cost and improved durability, reaching cost reductions for off shore energy production of about 40% of the current value (levelised cost of energy), with cost values;
produced by wind energy system of clearly below 10 ct€/ kWh or
produced by tidal stream generator system of 15 ct€/kWh;
Reduction of environmental impact by 35% (based on life cycle assessment and eco design).
The performance levels and respective impact of the proposed solution(s) should be in line with those specified in the relevant parts of the SET plan (link to be integrated)
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Recent advances in the collection and exploitation of large data sets open the possibility for major industrial and social innovations. The European Open Science Cloud initiative aims to maximise the incentives for sharing data and to increase the capacity to exploit them, to ensure that data can be used as widely as possible.
Increasing aspects of research in the transition to a low-carbon energy system in Europe rely on the collection, analysis and processing of large data sets. Insights, information and knowledge are increasingly extracted from data sets in individual sectors and in the combination of data from different sectors.
The challenge is to promote the opening of research databases for low-carbon energy in Europe, and to support a European-level approach to defining the development of future research data bases; this action focuses on the area of low-carbon energy. As the energy transition combines different scientific disciplines, particular attention has to be paid to agreed metadata in order to allow for the joint exploitation of data from these disciplines.
Scope:
Proposals will develop together with energy research communities several of the items below:
Development and use of data management practices that follow findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable (FAIR) principles, and to the validation of data quality measures;
Coordination of existing data repositories and databases, including those from SETIS and from the IEA;
Access to tools to manage energy data with FAIR principles; promotion of open source access of such tools;
Access to analytics to exploit energy data; promotion of open source access of such tools;
Capacity building of data experts for the domain of low-carbon energy research;
New research topics based on the analysis of large data sets in the energy domain;
Trans-disciplinary research combining data from different domains and at different scales;
Development of partnerships with industry to promote the opening of large datasets of interest to foster research into future technologies and services.
A broad coverage of the issues mentioned above is encouraged.
Recommendations that will be produced by the ongoing study on ""Opportunities and barriers for opening of research databases in low-carbon energy research"" should be taken into account[1].
Proposals should also follow developments of the European Open Science Cloud initiative, and plan to cooperate with and complement this activity.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increasing/extending/widening the use of low-carbon energy research databases, particularly those from publicly financed R&I projects.
Development of a critical mass of open research databases in Europe, and of researchers equipped with the know-how for the deployment, maintenance and exploitation of these.
Easy and open access to these databases and to tools for their elaboration and exploitation, leading to increased efficiency of research investments.
Strengthening of data-intensive research on low-carbon energy in Europe;
Strengthening the development of industrial applications of data-intensive processes.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to Executive Agencies and will be implemented by the Commission services.
