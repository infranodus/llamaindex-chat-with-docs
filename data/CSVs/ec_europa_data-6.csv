Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Better use of process excess/waste heat represents a significant source of energy savings for industries. In a context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and introducing the concept of circular economy in heat management in view of industrial process electrification, European industries have a clear interest in finding new ways to capture the heat produced by their process and to reuse it or to produce electricity. The conversion of excess heat back to electricity would also improve energy efficiency, mitigate the increase of electricity consumption due to industrial electrification and thereby reduce the load on the power grids. This will also facilitate balancing the grid due to intermittent supply of electricity from renewables.
Innovative heat to (mechanical or electrical) power conversion cycles using either organic fluid or supercritical CO2 fluid, present several benefits compared to conventional steam cycles. Organic cycles have the potential to recover waste heat sources as low as 150 °C, whereas steam systems are limited to heat sources above 260 °C. The supercritical CO2 cycle covers medium and high temperatures with drastically reduced footprint, higher efficiency, reduced or eliminated water requirement, reduced operational costs, compared to steam cycles.
These technologies are also transferable to renewable and conventional power generation with higher efficiency and reduced footprint than established technologies.
Scope:
Accounting for the results of previous research[1], proposals will integrate an industrial waste heat-to-power conversion system using one type of fluid (supercritical CO2 or organic) and demonstrate the system operation in industrial environment at an output power level of at least 2 MW, with improved cost efficiency compared to existing solutions. Proposals are expected to bring the technologies to TRL 6 or 7 (please see part G of the General Annexes)
In order to reach this goal all the following development areas need to be covered:
Optimisation of thermal cycles for different temperature levels of recovered heat and constrained industrial environment, in terms of efficiency and economics (capex, opex);
Development/improvement of design tools at components and system levels;
Development/improvement of materials and components: heat exchangers, turbomachinery, waste heat recovery unit, power generator and electronics, etc.
Integration and demonstration of the system in industrial environment;
Technical, and economical life cycle assessment of heat-to-power systems adapted for at least 4 energy intensive industrial sectors, to demonstrate economic viability, define business cases and exploitation strategy;
Dissemination of the technical and economic benefits.
Given the transversal nature of the technology, the potential for transferring the technology to the generation of electrical power from conventional and renewable energy sources should be assessed and disseminated.
In the case of supercritical CO2 technology, the potential for international cooperation[2] to facilitate technology development and market uptake should also be explored, notably to: establish mechanisms for exchange of R&D results (e.g. on materials performance); establish forum on safety issues, on standardisation of performance models; establish standards for instrumentation performance and calibration.
This topic contributes to the roadmap of the Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency (SPIRE) cPPP. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged.
The proposals should demonstrate cycles, components and systems designs that are particularly suitable for industrial use with proven contributions in terms of industrial excess/waste heat use and impact on power distribution networks.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction of this part of the Work Programme.
The Commission considers that optimizing cycles, components and systems and demonstrating the solution in an industrial setting would require an EU contribution of EUR 12 to 14 million. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Actions are expected to make substantial contributions in terms of industrial excess/waste heat use and impact on power distribution networks:
Improved cycles to achieve scalability to higher power levels, higher cost effectiveness, wider input temperature ranges, significantly reduced system size compared to steam turbines, allowing wider take up of heat recovery from more industrial processes;
Primary energy savings (GWh/year) in industry (heat recovery) and potential primary energy savings in the power generation sector, assuming full deployment in EU Member States and (as far as data are available for the calculation of the impact) in Associated Countries.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The energy label is a key driver for innovation in the energy efficiency area. For more than 20 years the tangible results of the transformation of the European market are being observed, where only the products with the highest energy efficiency parameters and innovative solutions to save energy are being commercialised. The energy label stimulates a real competition in innovation among product manufacturers. However the current energy label has a closed scale from A+++ to D, so once the majority of products reach the highest classes, the label no longer stimulates further innovation. Therefore, the Commission has proposed that, in future, labels will be 'rescaled' (as well as go back to A-G scale), i.e. existing products will be re-categorised in lower classes so that the top classes are empty and provide new stimulus for innovation. The ‘empty top-class’ label will be the strongest and continuous innovation trigger. Rescaling of labels would take place approximately every ten years or faster, if technology development and innovation has been faster than expected. This rescaling, will be a challenging operation in terms of organisation and provision of information to the concerned market actors, requiring technical guidance, communication and training campaigns, including during the transitional periods[1] in order that the new scale is correctly applied by manufacturers leaving enough space for future innovations. Customers' confusion should be avoided by replacing labels displayed on the affected products within a short timeframe in order to ensure consumer choice to be directed to the highest class innovative products.
Scope:
The proposed action should cover one or more of the following points:
Raise the capacity of manufacturers and, in particular, retailers (e.g. through a comprehensive training methodology, involving a series of hands-on applications in each Member State) to fulfil their obligations providing and displaying respectively the correct label at the point of sale;
Develop and roll out tailored and effective actions focusing on awareness-raising and information campaigns to alert market actors (businesses, public procurement personnel, consumers etc.) of label rescaling, with a view to increasing understanding of labels and routing purchase decisions towards higher efficiency products. These actions should also address any additional references that may exist on the rescaled label (e.g. QR code);
Exchange of best practices in relation to these campaigns, including through the recommendation of common key messages to the respective target groups.
All relevant stakeholders necessary for the successful implementation of the action should be involved (e.g. manufacturers, retailers, public procurement personnel and consumers).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (million Euro);
Number of stakeholders (e.g. public procurement personnel, businesses and consumers) informed by actions aiming at improving the understanding of rescaled labels, minimising any risk of confusion (at least 5 million stakeholders per million Euro of EU funding);
Number of manufacturers, suppliers and retailers engaged by actions aiming at improving their understanding of rescaled labels, minimising the risk of confusion (at least 5 000 market actors per million Euro of EU funding);
Reduced compliance costs, maximise legal certainty and minimise errors during the transition periods for suppliers and dealers.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy Efficiency services (e.g. Energy Performance Contracting (EPC)) are available on the market already for quite some time. However, there is a big untapped potential in sectors and with actors not yet engaged in services triggering energy, CO2 and cost savings. At the same time, new technologies have emerged opening the door for new types of services which use ICT to better control and steer energy consumption according to market and system needs and to the availability of renewable energy; others are able to integrate energy services with non-energy benefits such as comfort. By bundling various services and benefits, additional target groups, sectors and financial resources can be accessed. Actions are also needed to structure and label the quality of demand side service providers (like ESCOs aggregators and energy cooperatives) and improve their accessibility for end energy users.
Finally, ICT-tools and big data generated by smart meters, smart devices and sensors will help monitor and verify energy savings and flexibility and thus provide for appropriate remuneration of optimised consumption. A particular challenge for energy services of this kind is that while they aim to involve different services (e.g. system services) and benefits (e.g. comfort) towards increasing their viability, they should nevertheless result in real, measurable energy savings and performance improvements of the overall energy system.
Scope:
2018 (Coordination and support action):
Actions should allow different market actors to get together and focus on developing integrated concepts and models which
enhance and refine successful energy performance contracting models and/or;
include pay-for-performance schemes and/or;
include customer individualized energy services as a result of better understanding of customer behaviour and needs derived of new data analytics tools;
engage new sectors and actors and/or;
integrate energy efficiency services with other energy services like distributed generation and demand response and including storage/hybrid energy systems and/or non-energy related services; these should be endorsed by relevant stakeholders and validated (for example tested around existing projects or projects under development);
factor in potential legal and contractual aspects (e.g. in relation to existing contracts or warranty, safety and data security issues linked to existing and newly deployed equipment).
Proposed actions should cover at least two (but not necessarily all) of the relevant areas and aspects identified below:
Energy service models (like EPC) and services that target new sectors and new actors;
Business models which work equally for energy efficiency and other services, building on contractual arrangements across different actors (ESCOs, aggregators, DSOs, energy cooperatives, obliged parties under the Energy Efficiency Obligation Schemes implementing art 7 EED and eventually the consumers) which traditionally cover different use cases business interests and different revenue;
""Pay for performance""-schemes which focus on permanently reducing power consumption in particular at peak times, thus attracting new sources of financing;
The use of 'big data' generated by smart meters, equipment, sensors and tools for standardised processes enabling a more accurate and dynamic measurement and verification of energy savings and flexible consumption, also in order to ex-ante identify and develop business opportunities;
Additional non-energy features that support the up-take of innovative energy efficiency services and technologies;
Improving the accessibility and quality of demand side service providers while enhancing their access to the market.
Proposals are expected to include clear business model development and a clear path to finance and deployment. Key partners should have the capability and interest in making the developed solution a core part of their business/service model to their clients.
The Commission considers that proposals for Coordination and Support Actions requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
2019 (Innovation action):
Projects should focus on demonstrating and testing innovative energy services in a real environment, across several market segments and across different actors in the value chain. To be economically viable, these services need to be able to rely on sound measurement and verification methodologies. They should cover several but not necessarily all of the relevant areas and aspects identified above, blending in innovative manner different revenue streams coming from different market segments and they should in all cases include innovative verification and monitoring measures. Moreover, they should demonstrate how potential legal and contractual aspects (e.g. in relation to existing contracts or linked to the use of equipment) have been accounted for.
Proposals should demonstrate that the tested business models and services are self-sustainable after the end of the project. The upfront investments in energy efficiency measures (e.g. upgrading of building energy performance) and in smart building systems should be paid back at least in part by revenues coming from energy savings and remunerated flexibility.
The Commission considers that proposals for Innovation Actions requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Where possible and appropriate, the actions should cooperate with the projects funded under the topics: DT-ICT-10-2018: Interoperable and smart homes and grids, DT-ICT-11-2019: Big data solutions for energy in the WP 5.i ICT, and LC-SC3-ES-6-2018-2020: LC-SC3-ES-5-2018-2020: TSO – DSO – Consumer: Large-scale demonstrations of innovative grid services through demand response, storage and small-scale (RES) generation.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Improved viability of innovative energy services.
In addition, proposals are expected to demonstrate, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
A growing offer and up-take of services that combine energy efficiency with other energy services, technologies and non-energy benefits;
A growing up-take of innovative data gathering and processing methods in the monitoring and verification of energy savings and flexibility;
The application of methods and concepts to ensure that: (i) innovative energy services are reliable and verifiable, (ii) service providers are trustworthy and accessible.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Mobilising investment in energy efficiency and renewables is key for Europe's energy transition. The European Commission proposed the Smart Financing for Smart Buildings (SFSB) initiative in the recently published Clean Energy for All Europeans winter package.
For the SFSB to succeed it is essential to boost project aggregation and build a substantial pipeline of energy efficiency investment projects across Europe. Cities and communities are the place where economic, social and environmental transformation actually happens. Cities and communities play a key role in aggregating smaller projects into sizable packages and in mobilising the significant amount of finance needed for the energy transition.
However, despite a tremendous potential, too few cities and communities in Europe succeed in developing and scaling up investment packages. A high degree of organisational, technical and financial innovation is needed to reach significant scale. A key gap is the lack of capacity of public authorities, especially of small and medium-sized municipalities to transform their overall long-term strategies, e.g. Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs) or similar, into credible investment concepts. Public authorities have limited resources, in particular, to access financial, technical and legal expertise needed to collect additional data, develop an investment programme of scale (e.g. pooling projects and/or bundling with neighbouring constituencies) and design finance strategies which demonstrate sufficient maturity to enable access to different finance routes, i.e. to develop their 'investment concept'.
These concepts would allow a large number of cities and communities to start the process for mobilising the investments in sustainable energy. When relevant, such concepts could be combined with other EU financing streams and services to trigger the expected investment (e.g. EFSI[1], ESIF[2], PDA[3], National Investment Platforms).
Scope:
Proposals are expected to set up and run a 'European City Facility' which offers financial support and services to cities and municipalities or their groupings:
The European City Facility should offer financial support to develop innovative investment concepts within a limited period of time, covering, inter-alia: a clear identification of the potential project pipeline, legal analysis, governance analysis, a description of how the investments will be financed and a design of the process to launch the investments.
Proposals should foresee to provide support to third parties ('support scheme') as described in part K of the General Annexes of the Work Programme. At least 80% of the budget should directly benefit cities, municipalities or their groupings.
Proposers should demonstrate the ability to run a support scheme at large scale in accordance with Horizon 2020 standards and that they are able to select the most cost-efficient and appropriate city and community applications taking account, inter alia, the scale of the potential investment and the number of inhabitants covered.
Proposers should be deeply rooted in the ecosystems of municipal sustainable energy planning and the challenge of finance of energy efficiency. Proposers should demonstrate that they are able to mobilise a critical mass of cities/municipalities or their groupings and have a sound and inclusive outreach strategy to cities and communities across Europe.
Proposals should foresee services to underpin European added value and earmark appropriate resources (maximum 10% of the requested EU contribution) for common actions that will underpin European added value.
In order to qualify for support through the European City Facility, cities and communities or their groupings should provide proof of political commitment, demonstrate, additionally to existing planning processes and resources, a minimum population covered (single or in groupings of municipalities) and an ambitious scale of potential investment and level of energy savings based on politically approved SEAPs, SECAPs[4] or plans of similar ambition, describe the investment sectors targeted, the type of financial solutions envisaged, the governance to develop the investment concept, and include a plan for long-term capacity building within the public administration, a plan on how they will engage with representatives of the key segments and citizens and a commitment for monitoring for 2 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 16 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Demonstration and documentation of increased leveraging of finance into energy efficiency investments by public authorities;
Overall, the action should trigger for every million Euro of Horizon 2020 support sustainable energy investments worth at least EUR 20 million;
Number of investment concepts delivered, and number of concepts that turned into tangible investments after the provided support;
Number of public authority staff with increased capacity for developing investible energy efficiency projects;
Innovation uptake by potential replicators;
Primary energy savings, renewable energy production and investments in sustainable energy triggered by participating public authorities after the support of the action (respectively in GWh/year and in million EUR of investments).
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

Africa is going through a rapid urbanisation phase and it is anticipated that, by 2030, there will be more people living in urban than rural areas. On the other hand, the housing supply is already far from meeting the highly growing demand in cities and the expectations of home owners, in terms of performance, comfort and health. One of the reasons for this situation is the insufficient use of construction materials and technologies, which are adapted to local climate and economic contexts. Imported materials and technologies, which are not always suitable for local conditions, are replacing the traditional and local building designs, construction techniques and materials. Poor indoor thermal conditions, in particular overheating, and high demand for expansive active cooling, are often the result together with an increased buildings' energy footprint. Use of cheap and low-quality materials to cut down construction costs and lack of knowledge about their performance are other problems related to this issue. There is a need to increase the knowledge about the benefits of using bioclimatic buildings design approaches, local materials, and construction techniques suitable to local contexts.
Scope:
Proposals should study the performance of a selection of European and African local bioclimatic building designs, local construction materials and techniques to determine how they could be utilized to increase the energy performance, living quality and sustainability of buildings in targeted geographical zones in Africa and their climatic and socio-economic conditions. Proposals should promote innovations, including bioclimatic approaches, to enable adaptation of local materials and techniques to current building design and construction practices and lifestyles. They should include maximizing passive cooling, passive ventilation, natural light gains and suitability for specific local climate conditions (e.g. stark rains). They should investigate how sustainable supply chains of local materials could be established or improved to cope with fast paces of construction, contributing to the support of local businesses. They should foster exchange and mutual learning between European and African stakeholders (policy-makers, architects, auditors, building sector private companies) for better regulation and implementation of locally adapted bioclimatic construction approaches.
Proposals should include the following activities:
Identification and documentation of African and European affordable buildings designs, construction techniques and materials suitable for a selection of local climatic and socio-economic contexts in Africa, based on bioclimatic construction approaches.
Exchange activities around the topic of fostering low-cost, high performance, locally adapted bioclimatic construction approaches for African and European policy-makers and on the development of building policies, standards, regulations, certificates and other relevant instruments and support measures in a selection of geographical zones in Africa.
They could also include the organization of one or several study visits to demonstration sites for African policy-makers and other key stakeholder including the construction sector. South-south cooperation is also encouraged.
Investigation of the measures (in particular policy ones) that could effectively support the development of sustainable and cost-effective supply chains of local construction materials, in order to enhance their competitiveness and contribute to the growth of local businesses.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate that they will trigger as many as possible of the impacts listed below:
Increased use of affordable, locally-adapted bioclimatic construction approaches in buildings in Africa with high energy performance and increase living comfort;
Expected (potential for) energy savings (kWh) in buildings thanks to the improved techniques;
Number of documented locally-adapted bioclimatic affordable building design, construction techniques and materials;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive[1], all EU countries have established independent energy performance certification systems supported by independent mechanisms of control and verification. However, current practices and tools of energy performance assessment and certification applied across Europe face a number of challenges.
Assessment processes and certificates have to become more reliable, user-friendly, cost-effective, have comparable good quality and be compliant with EU legislation in order to instil trust in the market and incite investments in energy efficient buildings. They have to increasingly reflect the smart dimension of buildings and at the same time, facilitate convergence of quality and reliability of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) across the EU. The building energy performance methodologies should also ensure a technology neutral approach, be transparently presented making use of International and European standards, in particular the ISO/CEN standards developed under Commission mandate M/480[2] aimed at enabling the presentation of national and regional choices on a comparable basis.
Next-generation energy performance assessment schemes will value buildings in a holistic and cost-effective manner across several complimentary dimensions: envelope performances, system performances and smart readiness (i.e. the ability of buildings to be smartly monitored and controlled and, to get involved in demand-side management strategies). The assessment should be based on an agreed list of parameters/indicators, such as e.g. calculated annual final energy use, share of renewable energy used, past (climate corrected) final energy consumptions and energy expenditure, comfort levels or the level of smartness. The assessment methods should increasingly take into account output measures of performance (actual measured data) making use of available and increasing number of building energy related data from sensors, smart meters, connected devices etc.. These new schemes should contribute to improving the effectiveness of certificates, by demonstrating how these could be strengthened, modernised and best linked to integrated national/regional certification schemes within a framework that aids compliance checking and effectiveness of financial support.
Scope:
2018 (Coordination and support action):
Proposals should involve relevant stakeholders (including national and regional certification bodies) to stimulate and enable the roll-out of next-generation of energy performance assessment and certification, with a view to achieve enhanced reliability, cost-effectiveness and compliance with relevant EU standards and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Proposals should develop strategies to encourage convergence of EPC practices and tools across the EU so as to ensure a comparable level of high quality, independent control and verification. The applicability of assessment and the certification schemes should be assessed through a broad set of well-targeted and realistic cases, featuring various locations, building types, climatic conditions and field practices including existing national EPC schemes. The assessment will aim at demonstrating the potential of an EU-wide uptake of the proposed assessment and certification schemes, along well-defined criteria. Embedding the EPCs and their recommendations in broader concepts such as energy audits, wider-buildings related databases (e.g. national EPC databases, national housing surveys, EU Building Stock Observatory) and one-stop-shops including administrative, financial and supply side information and linking EPCs to related concepts such as buildings renovation passports, individual buildings renovation roadmaps or building logbooks should also be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
2019 (Innovation action):
Proposals should address the definition and demonstration of innovative approaches for the assessment of building energy performance, focusing at first on the reliable assessment of building intrinsic performances (e.g. using inverse modelling) but working also towards output-based assessments using available building energy related data[3]. Proposals should involve relevant stakeholders (including national and regional certification bodies). The proposed approaches should be more reliable as well as cost-effective and compliant with relevant EU standards[4], in order to allow for an EU-wide deployment. Such approaches should rely on the combination of existing and proven technology components (starting from TRL 6-7, please see part G of the General Annexes) with well-structured methodologies and protocols that can lead to the definition of new certification schemes. They could also consider implications when using EPCs in building passports and renovation roadmaps.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive[1], all EU countries have established independent energy performance certification systems supported by independent mechanisms of control and verification. However, current practices and tools of energy performance assessment and certification applied across Europe face a number of challenges.
Assessment processes and certificates have to become more reliable, user-friendly, cost-effective, have comparable good quality and be compliant with EU legislation in order to instil trust in the market and incite investments in energy efficient buildings. They have to increasingly reflect the smart dimension of buildings and at the same time, facilitate convergence of quality and reliability of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) across the EU. The building energy performance methodologies should also ensure a technology neutral approach, be transparently presented making use of International and European standards, in particular the ISO/CEN standards developed under Commission mandate M/480[2] aimed at enabling the presentation of national and regional choices on a comparable basis.
Next-generation energy performance assessment schemes will value buildings in a holistic and cost-effective manner across several complimentary dimensions: envelope performances, system performances and smart readiness (i.e. the ability of buildings to be smartly monitored and controlled and, to get involved in demand-side management strategies). The assessment should be based on an agreed list of parameters/indicators, such as e.g. calculated annual final energy use, share of renewable energy used, past (climate corrected) final energy consumptions and energy expenditure, comfort levels or the level of smartness. The assessment methods should increasingly take into account output measures of performance (actual measured data) making use of available and increasing number of building energy related data from sensors, smart meters, connected devices etc.. These new schemes should contribute to improving the effectiveness of certificates, by demonstrating how these could be strengthened, modernised and best linked to integrated national/regional certification schemes within a framework that aids compliance checking and effectiveness of financial support.
Scope:
2018 (Coordination and support action):
Proposals should involve relevant stakeholders (including national and regional certification bodies) to stimulate and enable the roll-out of next-generation of energy performance assessment and certification, with a view to achieve enhanced reliability, cost-effectiveness and compliance with relevant EU standards and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Proposals should develop strategies to encourage convergence of EPC practices and tools across the EU so as to ensure a comparable level of high quality, independent control and verification. The applicability of assessment and the certification schemes should be assessed through a broad set of well-targeted and realistic cases, featuring various locations, building types, climatic conditions and field practices including existing national EPC schemes. The assessment will aim at demonstrating the potential of an EU-wide uptake of the proposed assessment and certification schemes, along well-defined criteria. Embedding the EPCs and their recommendations in broader concepts such as energy audits, wider-buildings related databases (e.g. national EPC databases, national housing surveys, EU Building Stock Observatory) and one-stop-shops including administrative, financial and supply side information and linking EPCs to related concepts such as buildings renovation passports, individual buildings renovation roadmaps or building logbooks should also be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
2019 (Innovation action):
Proposals should address the definition and demonstration of innovative approaches for the assessment of building energy performance, focusing at first on the reliable assessment of building intrinsic performances (e.g. using inverse modelling) but working also towards output-based assessments using available building energy related data[3]. Proposals should involve relevant stakeholders (including national and regional certification bodies). The proposed approaches should be more reliable as well as cost-effective and compliant with relevant EU standards[4], in order to allow for an EU-wide deployment. Such approaches should rely on the combination of existing and proven technology components (starting from TRL 6-7, please see part G of the General Annexes) with well-structured methodologies and protocols that can lead to the definition of new certification schemes. They could also consider implications when using EPCs in building passports and renovation roadmaps.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Based on results of the BUILD UP Skills initiative, in particular the National Qualification Platforms and Roadmaps, as well as the qualification and training schemes developed in various Member States, the challenge is now to act at market level and to support legislative changes that will stimulate the demand for energy skills.
The objective is to increase the number of skilled building professionals and/or blue collar workers across the building design, operation and maintenance value chain (designers, architects, engineers, building managers, technicians, installers, blue collar workers including apprentices, and other building professionals), with a specific focus on the engagement of SMEs. Recourse to skilled professionals/workers both for renovations and new constructions of buildings and district scale solutions should be made more attractive and easier for companies and home owners alike.
Scope:
The focus of submitted proposals should be on the direct stimulation of demand for energy skills in construction. This is calling for the development, up-scaling and combination of a range of tools and initiatives, e.g.:
Tools facilitating the mutual recognition of energy skills and qualifications in the construction sector: development of sustainable energy skills passports/registers for workers at regional/national level and support for their take up at EU level, mobile applications facilitating the comparison of workers' skills and qualifications between countries (e.g. by enabling the direct comparison of learning outcomes);
National, regional or local initiatives raising awareness of home and building owners and tenants about the benefits of sustainable energy skills and providing financial incentives for renovations done using skilled workers/professionals;
Support to public authorities for the development of new legislative frameworks, e.g. requirements for skilled workers in public procurement;
Partnerships with producers and retailers of construction products (e.g. DIY stores) to raise awareness of the salesforce and of consumers about energy efficient products, skilled workers and good practice in construction/renovation;
Initiatives reinforcing the link between skills/education and energy performance/quality of construction e.g. tools showing the reduction of the performance gap as result of an increase quality of the works.
Proposals need to be focused and are not necessarily required to address the whole range of professions and crafts involved in the building sector. They may however consider the entire design chain (e.g. manufacturers). If the proposal addresses specifically design, material life cycles and embodied energy shall be considered. Adequate consideration should also be given to improved appreciation of the end user's needs including the quality of indoor environment (thermal and visual comfort, acoustics, air quality, etc.) as well as improved operation and maintenance.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Measurable energy savings and/or renewables production resulting from improved skills;
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Increased number of certification schemes for energy efficiency skills;
Improved mutual recognition of sustainable energy skills between Member States and neighbouring countries;
Improved collaboration and understanding across different trades and professional groups;
Increased market acceptance of sustainable energy skills;
Legislative changes stimulating the demand for energy skilled construction workers/professionals;
Demonstrated reduction in the gap between designed and actual energy performance through improved quality of construction.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Medical devices to measure and stimulate brain activity are emerging as tremendously powerful therapeutic tools that could revolutionise the treatment of brain diseases. Anomalous neuronal electrical signals are present in a wide range of disorders including memory impairment (Alzheimer’s), epilepsy, chronic pain, mood disorders, movement disorders (Parkinson’s), ischemic cognitive decline (post-heart attack), sensory disorders (hearing loss, tinnitus), cerebrovascular events, aging related neurodegeneration, traumatic brain injury amongst many others.
Unfortunately, existing devices to restore normal patterns of brain activity by stimulation have serious limitations. Invasiveness, limited miniaturisation, poor resolution (with only coarse measurement and stimulation available), limited spatial coverage (not able to monitor or stimulate a sufficient number of neurons) hamper the therapeutic effect or render these solutions unattractive for clinicians and patients.
Yet today’s state-of-the art microelectronics and microfabrication are potentially conducive to novel neuro-devices with high levels of miniaturisation, ultra-low power consumption, multi-site sensor/stimulator arrays (linear, planar or 3D with a wealth of geometries) and wireless architectures, leading to lower risk, shorter recovery times and better patient acceptance.
Further, progress can also be achieved by the discovery of new physical principles for activity monitoring (invasive or non-invasive) and activity modulation. These could explore ultrasound, light (optogenetics or otherwise), mechanical stimulation, local release of neuroactive compounds, ionising radiation, etc.
It is the right time to explore these opportunities and develop novel neurodevices that can be rapidly accepted by clinicians and patients.
Proposals submitted to this call should tackle at least one of the following two challenges:
A full device with unique features, e.g. targeting a currently untreated disorder, offering unprecedented miniaturisation, low latency closed-loop monitoring-stimulation feedback (if necessary), ultra-low power consumption, low/moderate invasiveness (e.g. compatible with implantation with endoscopic techniques), high-resolution, sustainable, etc.
or
New or nascent physical principles or methodologies that could be the basis for future brain sensing and/or stimulation technologies, with clear and quantifiable advantages. Focus is on techniques that can offer unprecedented data on brain function or that allow unprecedented modulation of brain activity for therapeutic purposes or brain-computer interfacing.
Specific conditions for this challenge
Proposals targeting a full device are strongly encouraged to establish a plausible work plan to realise by the end of the project at least 1) a working prototype device or instrument and 2) pre-clinical data with proof of therapeutic action.
Proposals targeting the discovery of a new mechanism for monitor and/or stimulate are advised to de-risk the work plan by exploring multiple strategies in parallel, merging competing strategies into a single proposal for cost efficiencies and increased likelihood of success.
Consortia considering both targets in a single proposal are advised to carefully analyse whether the high risk inherent to the discovery of new mechanisms or principles could hamper the plausibility of completing a full device hinging on said principles.
All proposals must fully justify the clinical need for the targeted development, and structure the work plan accordingly, towards credible future transition to market. Proposals need to consider the cost-benefit of the targeted technology and demonstrate that the outcome will be acceptable by clinicians and patients.
The gender dimension in research content should be taken into account, where relevant.

Deadline date","Scope:
Cell and gene therapy (CGT) are widely accepted as top biomedical trends for over three years now and continue to evolve in their use for treating human diseases. CGTs are expected to increasingly shape the medical treatment and diagnosis, as we are approaching the era of precision medicine. Cell-based therapy is a promising strategy for effective treatment across a wide range of diseases though the focus so far, has primarily been on cancer, e.g. Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy made from removing T cells from individual patients, engineer them to be able to recognize and kill cancer cells before re-administer them to the same patient. CAR-T cell therapy is widely regarded as having revolutionised the treatment of some blood cancers. Recent research evidence suggests that cell therapy can effectively apply to solid cancers as well.
Gene therapy, on the other hand, is yet far from having revealed its full potential and, therefore, innovative gene therapies remain a top priority in genomic medicine. Some companies believe that, after having achieved a robust proof-of-concept, clinical development and downstream interaction with regulatory agencies will be easy. The reality, however, is that the whole process from concept to commercialisation, from research to commercial grade viral vector under GMP standards, is a very demanding one, with the constant need for technological improvements to successfully overcome challenges such as increasing accuracy/specificity and scaling up the production or the release of tests that must be completed before use in patients. Finally, combined cell- and gene-based approaches in preclinical studies, is a relatively new bio-trend that is increasingly gaining the interest of cell and gene therapy scientists worldwide.
With this Pathfinder Challenge, EIC strategically aims at reinforcing critical components of the European cell and gene therapy community, such as focused research consortia, start-ups and spinoffs, in their ability to compete and sustain in this fiercely competitive field, full of challenges and obstacles all along the way from discovery to the manufacturing step. Proposals submitted to this call should effectively address exactly that, by proposing convincing technological solutions and/or new breakthrough concepts that go far beyond the current state-of-the-art.
Proposers are invited to submit disease-specific or non-disease-specific proposals, focused on emerging technologies or technological solutions aimed to overcome the current cell and gene therapy challenges in one or several the areas listed below, but without being restricted only to these areas.
Advancing cell therapy manufacturing and products to a clinical stage:
Advanced technological solutions that can effectively support the GMP manufacturing step of cell therapy e.g. in terms of speed and cost effectiveness.
Novel cell therapy products, targeted to frequent diseases such as cancer and organ failure but also to less frequent diseases like immunodeficiency disorders, that can be used by clinical stage biopharmaceutical companies.
Cell therapy technological solutions that can improve important constraints in handling highly concentrated and complex formulations of recombinant biologics, such as controlled release of therapeutics and injectability.
Improving adoptive cell therapies (CAR-T, TCR, TIL):
New technological solutions that would help to improve current adoptive cell therapy approaches: i) by lowering the high cost and complexity of the procedure; ii) by overcoming the long known rejection problem observed in the off-the-shelf or allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies; iii) by targeting the CAR into one location, which would take away the variability problem (the CAR randomly goes into the genome of cells resulting in variable levels of potency) and iv) by developing CAR-T based new immunotherapeutic approaches against solid tumours with the use of monoclonal antibodies.
Identifying next generation cell therapies for cancer:
New technological platforms that can contribute to identifying next-generation cell therapies for cancer (finding new targets for the engineered immune cells to home in on, or novel source of cells for new therapeutic approaches) as well as improving existing therapies to make them more efficient and safer. The latter could include naive fully functional T-cells.
Applying cell therapy to treat cancer patients in a personalised manner:
Advanced technological solutions that would enable to apply cell-based therapies to treat patients in a personalised/precision manner. Single cell-based approaches (analysing DNA, RNA, epigenetic marks, proteins, metabolites used in combination with single cell sequencing, single cell imaging and spatial profiling) in particular to allow to map the presence of individual cells in the tumour environment.
New technological solutions including lab-grown cancer organoids or organs-on-a-chip which would allow to test the patient’s response to various cell therapies and drugs, alone or in combination, prior to the initiation of the treatment, are sought.
Improving the effectiveness and lowering the risks of gene delivery systems (vectors):
Novel gene therapy approaches using the power of CRISPR-Cas or other molecular machineries leading to more effective and robust gene delivery systems (vectors) and/or more precise and reliable correction of genetic mutations.
Technological approaches that can tackle long lasting challenges in gene therapy (e.g. the transient instead of stable expression of the transfected gene).
New technological solutions to reduce toxicity, as a result, of administering repetitive doses of viral vector(s) to patients in clinical trials.
New or improved gene delivery vehicles using next generation AAV or other recombinant vectors with the ability to target specific tissue types and persist in non-dividing cells for long periods of time.
Improving gene therapy manufacturing processes and production:
With the first gene therapies on the market and dozens more in trials, the race is on to improve the production and manufacturing processes to deploy gene therapies at scale. Technological solutions are sought to effectively control challenges in the production of viral vectors at the large scales needed to reach the clinical trial step. Speed is critical, yet excessive speed can put product quality, safety, and efficiency at risk.
Specific conditions for this challenge
In order to apply, your proposal must focus on emerging technologies or breakthrough new concept-based technological solution that go far beyond the current state-of-the-art, aimed to overcome cell and gene therapy challenges and obstacles companies are currently being faced with, at the preclinical or clinical level or bio-manufacturing level. Proposers can submit disease or non-disease specific proposals.
Your project must aim to deliver, by its end, at least one of the specific outcomes defined for this challenge. The gender dimension in research content should be taken into account, where relevant.

The EIC Transition Open is twofold, supporting both the maturation and validation of a novel technology, and the development of a business case and business model towards the innovation’s future commercialisation.
EIC Transition projects should address both technology and market/business dimensions where iterative learning processes based on early customer feedback is possible. These activities should include a suitable mix of research, technology development and validation activities to increase the maturity of the technology beyond proof of principle to viable demonstrators of the technology in the intended field of application (i.e. up to Technology Readiness Level 5 to 6) in the attempt to address market readiness towards commercialisation and deployment, as well as other aspects of regulation, certification and standardisation, aimed at getting both the technology and the business idea investment-ready.
The objectives of the EIC Transition are to mature both the technology and business idea to increase the project’s technology and its market readiness. By doing this, the EIC Transition offers its applicants a solid support to deliver on the market a technology that is effective for its intended application, as well as a successful business model and business plan for its development to the market.
The EIC Transition provides a total indicative budget of EUR 59.6 million. The EIC considers proposal with a requested EU contribution of up to a EUR 2.5 million as appropriate. Requesting larger amount is possible if properly justified.
Call deadline for submitting proposals is 22 September 2021 at 17h00 Brussels local time. This should be submitted via the European Funding & Tender Opportunities Portal.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Raise awareness, knowledge and practical use of legal procedures to implement the practices of innovation procurement;
Leverage capacity building, skills and legal knowledge among public and private buyers;
Explore and scale up the best examples of innovation procurement practices,
Contribute to the establishment of innovation friendly legal frameworks, and market-oriented procedures;

Foster public and private partners’ collaboration in the co-design processes to match their needs and identify existing technologies that could result in procurement of innovation.
Scope:
Target group(s): Public and private buyers, public-owned enterprises, SMEs and start-ups, research and technological organisations.
Despite legal reforms and incentives in the area of public procurement of innovative solutions, the lack of awareness, skills and knowledge within public and private buyers remains the important problem obstructing implementation of innovation procurement in practice. While there is an overriding necessity to change traditional procurement approaches, the need for dedicated training and guidance, exchange of best practices and capacity building in this area becomes necessary to reveal innovation procurement potential. The proper design of strategies and procedures, in line with the existing legal frameworks, would define marked-oriented proposals, facilitate the implementation of innovation procurement, and ensure its long-term success. Moreover, it will leverage potential new markets and contribute to tackle societal challenges in a more efficient and sustainable way.
The proposals should focus on the following activities:
accessible dedicated training portfolios, to improve skills and capacities to design innovative procurement;
awareness-raising and enhanced knowledge on innovation procurement legal frameworks for public buyers and evaluators of innovative procurements;
enhanced innovation knowledge and skills within buyers, raising awareness about co-design process between SMEs and buyers (public and private) that may help to discover the most up-to-date innovative technological solutions, and assist in their development and further acquisition;
scale up best examples on the definition of needs and design of programmes, procedures and long-term strategies in the field of innovation procurement;
set up new experts networks and/or local competence centres or advance existing ones, including the coaching services to set up innovation procurement, legal assistance, the support on the definition of resources and tools, and the exchange of best practices;
public and private buyers’ cooperation and partnerships with the innovation deployment actors, particularly innovative SMEs and start-ups community, research institutions and technological organisations in order to tap into the under-exploited innovative potential of these type of companies.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
availability of highly and appropriately skilled professionals enabling the practice of Open Science with adequate knowledge of standards, applications and tools and best practices for delivering, managing, re-using, sharing and analysing FAIR data, as well as other digital research objects;
researchers are able to transform the way they carry out research and exploit research outputs, leading to better quality and more productivity of research;
contribute to the Horizon Europe EOSC Partnership.
Scope:
Development of new support material, curricula and learning pathways for researchers, data curators, and data stewards and new types of professionals. To ensure an efficient uptake and exploitation of data by Public Authorities (e.g. for evidence-based policy making), policy makers should also become skilled in data acquisition, management and analysis. Proposals should therefore cover the following activities:
Engage with the relevant stakeholders at national and institutional level in order to co-create, promote, broker and ensure the recognition of digital career profiles specifically related to Open Science. This includes the development of quality assurance mechanisms for professional training and qualifications.
Promote existing and develop new curricula (at undergraduate, PhD and professional level) that meet the demands of open and data-intensive science, and the establishment of advanced learning environments, in order to train the next generation of scientists, librarians and infrastructure professionals on topics such as the management and integration of diverse data flows and artificial intelligence for FAIR data management.
Foster the development of a distributed pan-European user support network, supporting the collaboration of existing networks of competence and data curation centres, in order to provide expertise on storing, sharing and reusing digital outputs, as well as on the onboarding of EOSC services and the provision of open science resources.
Support the development of a quality assurance and certification framework for learning material taking into account the life cycle of materials to ensure that training is up to date with technology and policy changes, as part of lifelong learning programmes.
Promote the training of civil servants, policy makers and agencies, as well as their engagement with researchers, in order to foster the efficient uptake of relevant scientific data by public administration and encourage its use for evidence-based policy making, building on best practices where appropriate[1].
Proposals should take into account and collaborate with the resulting project/s from the topic H2020-INFRAEOSC-03-2020[2] and building on the results of the projects funded under the topic H2020-INFRAEOSC-05-2020[2] on training, earmarking the necessary resources to do so. In addition, similar collaboration should be envisaged with the resulting grant/s from the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-05. They should establish synergies with national and regional programmes on digital skills and training as well as with other parts of Horizon Europe (e.g. Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, activities of EIT KICs[4]) and other EU funding sources (e.g. Digital Europe Programme (DEP), Erasmus+), and policies (e.g. European Higher Education Area (EHEA)). They should be credible in that the necessary funds for hiring or continuing the employment of staff, such as “data curators and stewards” in universities and research performing institutions, have been ensured at institutional, regional or national level, as these funds are not to be provided by the Commission.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
European researchers can find, access and re-use an increasing amount of research outputs across borders and disciplines through state-of-the-art technologies underpinning discoverability and interoperability of research outputs;
contribute to the Horizon Europe EOSC Partnership.
Scope:
Enable the enforcement and implementation of the EOSC Persistent Identifier (PID) policy[1] by developing tools, processes and additional infrastructure required to support use of PIDs to a maximal extent, for both the management and analysis of data, and also the publication, curation and tracking of research outputs. This should include a PID ‘meta resolver’ for EOSC or tools to support the alignment of PID infrastructure with the EOSC PID Policy. In addition, and building on community efforts on metadata and ontologies and on the work developed under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-05, this topic aims at ensuring the adoption and use of coherent metadata frameworks and deploying a common dataset search to enhance discovery via EOSC. Proposals under this topic should also cover other research outputs, such as software, developing services based on open standards and common practices adopted by the different disciplines.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
Contribute to the consolidation of an interoperable ecosystem of PID Infrastructures based on open specification and standards to support machine actionability and offer sufficient flexibility and capacity e.g. by developing a common PID ‘meta resolver’ and standardised interfaces and open protocols for exchanging information on PIDs to support the creation and use of a PID Graph[2].
Develop EOSC PID services to address a wide variety of applications appropriate to community needs.
Develop schemas and APIs based on open specifications and metadata framework as well as related crosswalks for improved discovery and interoperability.
Develop and deploy a flexible and scalable federated search service across the EOSC repositories, exploiting the aforementioned building blocks (PIDs resolution, APIs and metadata schemas). Such service should ensure customisability of querying (e.g. interfaces, APIs and scripts) and, when possible, ranking of queries results according to FAIRness of data and other prioritisations responding to the users’ needs.
Develop services and tools to archive, reference, describe and cite research software, based on standards and common practices of the different disciplines.
Develop services that build on metadata registries, starting from those that support communities in the uptake of metadata schemas and crosswalks and facilitate their maintenance; services to validate data sources against metadata schemes and to monitor data sharing, notably across communities and disciplines, are also expected.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC. In particular, projects should take into account and coordinate the technical work with the ongoing grants under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-05, earmarking the necessary resources to do so. They should build on the EOSC PID policy from the PID Task force of the EB Architecture WG[3] and FAIR WG[4] and should coordinate with the awarded grants under the topic H2020-INFRAEOSC-03-2020[5] and the future procurement activity under Other Actions[6].

increased availability of (pre)operational services that can be customised and integrated in the existing workflows of researchers across different disciplines, facilitating the cross-disciplinary collaboration, reducing the time to results and increasing productivity.
Scope:
The aim is to provide researchers with a set of highly innovative new services that would exploit, in a structural way, cloud-based EOSC technologies and European compute and data management capacities.
Proposals should cover the following activities:
Development and improvement of existing pre-operational software, tools and open source services, aiming to be integrated to the service-based architecture offered through the EOSC;
Iterative and inclusive development in close cooperation/co-design with the relevant user communities;
Improving the TRL of the components and adding new features based on requirements from research communities, use of open source software and tools for wide availability and uptake;
The application range of these services for data intensive science is wide (e.g. automated extraction of information from scientific literature, experimentation, optimising experimental design, collection and analysis of heterogeneous and/or large-scale data, validation of data quality, repeatability and reproducibility in science, discovery and on-demand provisioning of open science resources and their reuse; storing, sharing and reusing research data, enabling secure data use and transactions, workflow management) making use of various enabling technologies, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning, natural language processing, automation, simulation, big data analytics or blockchain.
To be robust, customizable and scalable, all developments should be tested against 2-3 real life use cases from a variety of scientific domains. The projects should cooperate with other relevant and related projects and e-Infrastructures and large user communities. Joint use cases and testing across individual project boundaries are encouraged.
The services should be integrated in the EOSC core service platform[1] and proposals should include sufficient provisions to address the integration, including, appropriate IPR and licence agreements. The resources that the services will offer should be clearly identified in the proposals. The sustainability model for the long-term availability of services can rely on EOSC. Participation of industry players, including SMEs, is recommended for both the development and further exploitation of the project results.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
improved findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-usability (“FAIRness”) of data and other research outputs by coordinating the implementation of frameworks and the alignment of FAIR data practices on metadata, persistent identifiers, etc.;
wide uptake of and compliance with FAIR data principles and practices by national and European research data and metadata providers and repositories, leading to the development of the Web of FAIR data and related services;
contribute to the Horizon Europe EOSC Partnership.
Scope:
Align and support the development and implementation of common EOSC methodologies, open standards and frameworks to ensure wide uptake and coherent implementation of the FAIR principles, to support the FAIRness of the research digital objects made accessible through EOSC.
Proposals should cover all of the following areas and activities:
a) Persistent identifiers:
Support the creation of a coordination mechanism of EOSC PID Service Providers to respond to the needs of research and Open Science, in a way that ensures sustainability, continuity of services and innovation.
Promote the alignment of PID infrastructures in line with the EOSC PID Policy.
Support the continuous standardisation of resource types and promotion of new practices to expand the range of identifiable objects e.g. instruments, services, organisations and software.
b) Metadata and ontologies:
Support the development of governance structures at discipline level for coordinating the work on metadata and ontologies and ensure overall coordination within EOSC.
Develop EOSC guidelines for a minimum metadata description for data discovery and metadata exchange, based on existing or emerging metadata schemas and tools.
Develop EOSC guidelines for common standards to archive, run, reference, describe and cite research software.
Collect information about existing metadata schemas, ontologies, crosswalks, and tools for metadata management and disseminate best practices amongst EOSC-relevant repository operators.
Support all research communities to develop and adopt disciplinary standards, to generate clear and precise definitions for the terms they use, and to consolidate common metadata and data schemata for use in the EOSC context. Provide support to make these definitions publicly available and referenceable by persistent identifiers for machine actionability.
In carrying out the previous actions, proposals should take into account, and build collaboratively on, existing actions by established initiatives and organisations.
c) Metrics, certification and guidelines for FAIR:
Support research communities to implement existing or emerging metrics and make use of the FAIR data maturity model[1] to develop assessment methods or to assess FAIR digital objects and iterate based on testing. Building on previous and current developments, for instance, by the ESFRI clusters, proposals should engage with new communities to accelerate the uptake of these best practices broadly.
Translate FAIR guidelines and frameworks to make them applicable to other digital objects, such as software, code, data management plans, protocols, etc.
d) Interoperability:
Agree and implement a common set of rules to ensure data and services within EOSC support interoperability.
Promoting the use of already existing common technical specifications, standards or infrastructure, endorsed by the various scientific communities.
Foster alignments with existing frameworks and standards from non-scientific large data sources of interest for research and, where appropriate, promote in such context the implementation of the FAIR principles as means to improve interoperability.
The research communities can be additionally supported through financial support to third parties in the form of grants to carry out or contribute to some of the actions under the areas and activities listed above.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC. In particular, proposals should build on the work developed by the FAIRsFAIR project[2] and by the FAIR Working Group[3] of the EOSC Executive Board. In addition, they should map and incorporate all relevant outputs, services and results produced by the ESFRI Cluster projects, e-Infrastructures and the national initiatives in the above mentioned areas, as well as establish the necessary coordination and bidirectional feedback mechanism with the projects resulting from the Horizon Europe topics HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-06, HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03 and the Other action ""FAIR and open data sharing in support of European preparedness for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases"" under this Work Programme, that will incorporate FAIR to challenge driven use cases. In addition, this topic should aim to develop concrete proposals for the cross-linking of EOSC with the other envisioned European data spaces foreseen in the European strategy for data (COM/20202/66 final). Finally, projects will need to be flexible in order to take into account and coordinate the technical work with the ongoing grant/s under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-03, earmarking the necessary resources to do so.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
researchers, healthcare professionals, cancer patients and survivors contributing to cancer research regularly interact with EOSC to store, share, access, analyse and process research data and other research digital objects from their own discipline, across disciplines and national borders;
open and FAIR data are the new norm for research conducted under this mission area;
EU-wide sharing of research data relevant to this area is shown to be a critical mechanism to facilitate cancer research across Member States and Associated Countries;
contribute to guaranteeing safety of patients’ data while at the same time contributing to research advancement. Engaging with patients/survivors in the sharing, access and use of data;
EOSC grows into a trusted research and innovation data space and service platform in Europe that supports the interdisciplinary community involved in this mission area;
contribute to the Horizon Europe EOSC Partnership and other relevant partnerships related to cancer research.
Scope:
Reuse of research, clinical, epidemiological and socio-economic data within and across disciplines and borders require openness, infrastructure capacity, better handling, careful management, machine actionability and seamless access to services all along the data life cycle. The Horizon Europe mission areas recognise upfront that providing access to data, knowledge and digital services through federated infrastructures is a key enabling condition for success. In addition, European Partnerships tackling complex societal challenges through multi-disciplinary approaches are facing important challenges in the European R&I systems, including poor data interoperability. In recent years, different scientific communities have started developing ‘thematic clouds’ or ‘data spaces’ within their domain of research and innovation. The EOSC provides the enabling framework to share, connect and upscale best practices and services by the communities to implement FAIR principles for (open, when possible) data sharing and management. The development of this framework is advancing rapidly as EOSC enters its second phase of implementation. Access to an initial EOSC federation of research infrastructures and their services is being consolidated and concepts such as FAIR data management and FAIR-by-design digital research outputs (data, publications, software, code, protocols, etc.) become more prominent.
The overall objective of this topic is to accelerate research and innovation under this mission area through better access, management, interoperability and reuse of digital information, to be achieved by using and integrating EOSC resources ranging from EOSC federated infrastructures, services and data to guidelines, best practices, tools and metrics for the management of FAIR and open data. This should be achieved through cross-domain, strategic use cases of direct relevance to the mission areas and the European Partnerships supporting this mission area on cancer.
The use cases should demonstrate the value of sharing FAIR and open research data, help to establish data sharing and management practices within the involved communities and across the Member States and Associated Countries, leveraging European research infrastructures and e-infrastructures. The use cases should provide feedback to the EOSC Partnership on the desired future evolution of EOSC. Special attention shall be put on aspects of data harmonisation, integration of data collection, data quality assurance, data privacy and security, big-data analysis and machine learning methods, as well as on the socio-economic dimension of the use case. Proposals should also foster the creation of user environments that researchers in this field can then use in order to seamlessly interact with digital information in the framework of the EOSC ecosystem.
Proposals should provide for activities to collaborate with relevant European Partnerships. Synergies with Horizon Europe Cluster 1 activities and other relevant initiatives, including actions stemming from Cohesion policy programmes are welcome. The activities should contribute to the consolidation of a European Health Data Space which is well articulated with the EOSC. They should build on results of relevant Horizon 2020 projects, including those providing pilots/models for linking clinical data and samples to cancer research, on initiatives for cancer such as the European Cancer Information System with the European Network of Cancer Registries, the European Reference Networks, the Innovative Partnership for Action Against Cancer (iPAAC) Joint Action and on the lessons learned from the ongoing European COVID-19 Data Platform, the EU Platform for Rare Diseases’ Registration and other initiatives in other disease areas. Proposers should consider already established ESFRI research infrastructures and efforts by relevant ESFRI cluster projects.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the EOSC Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC. In particular, in areas such as data interoperability, metadata and vocabularies, the use of persistent identifiers or Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI), proposals should coordinate and establish a feedback mechanism with the awarded proposal/s from the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-05 in order to ensure alignment with EOSC policies and to identify common useful tools and resources as well as relevant data repositories that comply with EOSC guidelines. Proposals are also expected to engage and/or align where appropriate with projects funded under the Other action ""FAIR and open data sharing in support of European preparedness for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases"" in this Work Programme, for a synergetic development of the area of Health within EOSC.
Grants awarded under this topic should also cooperate with the actions awarded under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-SERV-01-01 to identify and better exploit related synergies, share results and to avoid overlaps. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
very high-bandwidth, end-to-end connectivity among research and education users all over Europe, and cross-border collaboration services that are reliable and secure, enabling Europe to overcome the remaining Digital Divide and to be at the forefront of global Research and Education, attracting data and talent;
secure access to computing facilities and data repositories for European and International research infrastructures (RIs) and paving the way for widespread access to common European Data Spaces;
an integrated portfolio of services for connectivity, collaboration, security, trust and identity;
collaboration with international partners, to foster global RI connectivity in line with Europe’s international cooperation policy objectives.
Scope:
Building on the successful former partnership in this field and the achievements delivered under the Horizon 2020 framework programme, and considering the need for continuing the provision of critical services for the scientific and research community without disruption, the Commission calls for a new partnership with the National Research and Education Networks that would cover the whole duration of Horizon Europe, with the following general objectives:
Provide faster, resilient, agile and secure connectivity services for enabling scientists, researchers and students to access near real-time applications that support development of solutions and evidence-based decision-making for society and a worldwide effective collaboration of virtual research communities. The aim is to provide connectivity in the European Research Area (ERA) in multiples of 100 Gbps, paving the way for Terabit connectivity in certain areas where higher bandwidth is required for both disciplinary and interdisciplinary research collaboration amongst the researchers and scientists across Europe and beyond. Both the cross-European educational dimension and providing ERA scientists and researchers with optimal and secure access to research infrastructures (RI) and data resources worldwide are within the scope of the FPA.
The scope of the partnership activities should be to deliver an action plan on basis of jointly agreed objectives, covering the next 7 years of work. The action plan should cover the following areas of activity:
1. High quality connectivity and collaboration services for excellence in Research and Education
Provide operational excellence by delivering and developing high quality, secure, trusted, interoperable and cost-effective services, connectivity and collaboration services for both Research and Education sectors and align service offering for supporting the policy agenda of ERA[1], EEA[2] and EHEA[3]: to enable borderless collaboration, and attract talent from anywhere in the world to cooperate and exchange data with their peers.
Provide core services on security and identity federation, in coordination with other e-infrastructure and heterogeneous identity providers to enable service interoperability and a trusted and seamless user experience. National and European regulation in electronic identity (e.g., such e-IDAS) should be considered in particular for the development of Trust & Identity service in order to maximise societal impact beyond the research and scientific community.
Innovation of the service portfolio, including possible activities at lower TRL levels, in order to support researchers working on new network and added-value services such as super high transfer speeds, quantum network testing, etc.
Stimulating the development of consortium partners’ human capital (including training, secondment and exchange schemes) will be an important pillar in fostering service innovation and assuring expertise in all Member States and Associated Countries.
2. State-of-the-art connectivity for the wider European Digital Infrastructure
Push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art of the communication commons by constant development of both innovative multi-domain services and their use, and by translating this innovation into a competitive European ICT sector. This can include interconnection with key European data spaces and data repositories, including the Common European data spaces[4] and with a wide spectrum of actors, e.g. industry and SMEs in collaboration with commercial operators.
Adapt to the changing environment by the continuous development of the service portfolio of the European communications commons while maintaining the high level of accountability, security, measurability, transparency and sustainability. Actions should align with and contribute to the regulatory, standardisation and policy framework in order to enable full exploitation of the communications commons.
Progressive upgrade from a Gigabit to a Terabit network as a critical part of the main public digital infrastructures in the EU.
3. International connectivity and collaboration
Services and network architecture shall enable European driven researchers and scientists unconstrained access to data and resources worldwide while attracting data and talent. Activities in the international realm shall clearly foster international cooperation among researchers, contribute to the objectives of other relevant EU programmes and policies, and leverage the existing resources to maximise impact. Capacity building activities will be a crosscutting element in international cooperation.
Wherever necessary in implementing the action plan, the partnership should make recourse to procurement as a fundamental tool for maximising the utility of available resources and broadening the offer of state-of-the-art digital services to scientific, research and education communities. The action plan should specify the main areas where procurement is expected to take place. Whenever the partnership makes recourse to procurement activities, it should explore broader scenarios and business models (including the participation in innovative procurement actions) for the benefit of the research and education community and potentially the wider user base.
The partnership should also develop close synergies with EU Policy and EU Programmes, wherever these are relevant for its activities, for instance with Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) or the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its KICs, for activities related to human capital development, training, and international collaboration. It may also seek synergies with other programmes and funding lines of the EU that demonstrate greater impact potential and or better efficiency in the use of resources in the implementation of the action plan.
The long-term cooperation between the Commission and the selected partners will be formalised within a Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) covering the entire duration of Horizon Europe. The extended duration of the partnership is justified by the need to provide a stable environment for the implementation of a European communications commons and uninterrupted provisioning of digital services.
Through the Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA), the Commission intends to award specific grants to implement the action plan agreed in the FPA, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the FPA (see also section on ""Other actions"").

The services should address different TRLs and they should be relevant for stakeholders along the whole value chain and in view of possible industrial applications. The facilities will provide training for their use including for services such as materials modelling, data mining, and experiment design.
Proposals aim at supporting the provision of trans-national and/or virtual access to researchers as well as training for using the infrastructures, and activities to improve, customise and integrate the services the infrastructures provide, so as to facilitate and integrate the access procedures and to further develop the remote or virtual provision of services.
Access provision activities will also contribute to address the objectives of European initiatives, such as the Circular Economy Action Plan and the EU Strategy for Plastics in the Circular Economy, to tackle critical issues such as materials design, processing, recycling, and recovery in a cradle-to-cradle cycle.
Proposals should adhere to the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures[2].
Proposals should clearly identify research communities and potential industrial users, which can benefit from this pan-European open access to research services and advanced instrumentations offered by internationally renowned facilities and strengthen the cooperation among academic and industrial researchers.
Proposals are expected to take into account relevant major European initiatives, such as the Open Innovation Test Beds, to exploit synergies or to build partnerships. Whenever appropriate, they should foster the use and deployment of global standards.
Data management (and related ethics issues), interoperability, as well as the connection of digital services (e.g. data services) to the European Open Science Cloud, should be addressed where relevant.
Proposals should make available to researchers the widest and most comprehensive portfolio of research infrastructures services which are relevant for the scope. To this extent, they should involve, as beneficiaries or as third parties, the necessary interdisciplinary set of research infrastructures of European interest[3] that provide such services. The inclusiveness of the proposal will be taken into account in the Excellence score. Proposals including only few of the research infrastructures services relevant to the scope will be scored lower.
Research infrastructures from third countries[4] may be involved when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in Europe.
Proposals should include an outreach plan to actively advertise its services to targeted research communities and, if applicable, to relevant industries, including SMEs.
Proposals are expected to exploit synergies and to ensure complementarity and coherence with other EU grants supporting access provision.
Proposals will include the list of services/installations[5] opened by research infrastructures for trans-national or virtual access and the amounts of units of access made available for users. Further conditions and requirements relating to access provisions that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in the “Specific features for Research Infrastructures” section of this Work Programme.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
enhanced and increased society’s long-term and consistent problem-solving capacity and evidence-based policy making in areas of climate-related risks, risk management, health and green transition, including a better understanding of socio-economic implications, through the provision of innovative, customised and efficient RI services;
enhanced and integrated cross-disciplinary R&I capacities addressing climate related-risks in Europe and in particular support relevant R&I objectives of Horizon Europe clusters, missions or partnerships;
harmonisation of data policies and management of IPRs and ethical issues; interoperability across disciplines and with risk management platforms;
researchers in the environment and climate change able to optimally exploit the research infrastructure services relevant for their research.
Scope:
Climate change and land use are increasing the occurrence and severity of natural hazards notably floods, storm surges, landslides, droughts, desertification, cryosphere melting and fires in Europe and their negative impacts. Research to understand the interlinked processes and to develop new knowledge and tools necessary to better predict, mitigate and adapt to these risks requires an integrated and strongly cross-disciplinary approach and access to very diverse research infrastructures (such as observatories, experimental facilities, modelling capacities or data infrastructures). However, necessary research infrastructures, including those prioritised by ESFRI, are often targeting primarily one or few disciplines, scientific communities or risks and cannot, individually, sufficiently serve a truly integrated and cross-disciplinary approach.
Proposals will bring together key complementary and possibly heterogeneous national and European research infrastructures to provide effective access to an integrated wide range of RI services (e.g.: observations, models and experimental platforms) necessary for highly cross-disciplinary research and innovation addressing climate-related multi-hazards risks in Europe including their social dimension. Actions will in particular offer, when appropriate, fit-for-purpose access modalities facilitating the joint selection and or coherent scheduling of cross-disciplinary user project(s) by several research infrastructures, ad-hoc support and training of (new) users, customised RI data, data products, scientific services including joint services by complementary infrastructures. Actions will develop interoperability among the research infrastructures as well as with relevant initiatives and programmes and facilitate the use of external data and services, such as Copernicus services, to further develop their portfolio of multi- and cross-disciplinary scientific services.
Proposals aim at supporting the provision of trans-national and/or virtual access to researchers as well as training for using the infrastructures, and activities to improve, customise and integrate the services the infrastructures provide, so as to facilitate and integrate the access procedures and to further develop the remote or virtual provision of services.
Proposals should adhere to the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures[1].

Actions should design customised and/or new RI services taking into account the needs of ongoing research in the field and of existing disaster risk management knowledge platforms and networks (e.g. the JRC Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre). Due attention to the latest development of Horizon Europe priorities, its Missions and Partnerships will ensure appropriate links and complementarities. Actions should provide for a flexible approach to address ad-hoc R&I specific requests and to respond to long-term or recurrent needs.
Proposals could consider, for their inclusion in the service portfolio, relevant services and expertise offered by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), and in particular by its Molecular Ecotoxicology and Microbiology laboratory [4], for the detection of antimicrobial resistance genes, viral RNA in water by quantitative PCR, metagenomics analysis of water samples, as well as in-house bioassays systems for detection of chemical pollutants’ mixture analysis.

Scope:
This topic aims at providing trans-national access (on-site or remote) and/or virtual access to integrated and customised RI services for curiosity-driven research in wide scientific domains, offered by a wide range of complementary and interdisciplinary top level research infrastructures. Scientific domains are identified on the basis of a Multi-Annual Priority Setting (MAPS) exercise aiming at achieving a balanced coverage of scientific disciplines addressed under the INFRASERV destination as well as complementarities with Horizon 2020 ongoing grants offering access provision. Within identified domains, emerging areas of research can also be served. The MAPS follows the taxonomy used in the ESFRI Roadmap.
In 2021, the scientific domains called under this topic are:
Geosphere, including geo-hazards and geo-resources;
Biosphere: terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems, including Arctic and forest;
Particle and nuclear physics.
Training for using the infrastructures, and activities to improve, customise and harmonise the services the infrastructures provide, so as to facilitate and integrate the access procedures, and to further develop the remote or virtual provision of services may also be supported.
Proposals should adhere to the guidelines and principles of the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures[1].

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Research infrastructures are not only thematically very diverse but also in terms of size, ranging from the long tail of science, often characterised by individual laboratories or small groups of researchers, to large, “big science” collaborations. Scientists and researchers, including the long-tail of science, lack capabilities enabling complex simulations, combining simulations with observations and dealing with very large volumes of diverse data from various and distributed sources. The availability of high-quality Digital Twins[1] across a wide range of thematic applications could fill this gap.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
availability of a pre-operational prototype of an interdisciplinary Digital Twin, using a combination of the latest digital technologies, relevant to addressing challenges where multi-disciplinarity is the defining element of complexity;
availability of latest modelling and prediction technologies in a number of different areas widely serving research communities and supporting interoperability of data and software, integration and collaboration across different scientific domains, disciplines and across the different research infrastructures involved;
a robust framework enabling Researchers to ensure the quality, reliability, verifiability of the data, information and outputs of such Digital Twins and to exploit to the maximum the existing and new data made available through the Common European Data Spaces and the European Open Science Cloud.
Scope:
Actions should develop digital twins that provide advanced modelling, simulation and prediction capabilities to RIs and their research communities through a convergent use of advanced digital technologies such as high performance computing, software, AI methods and big data analytics.
With the advent of big data analytics and supercomputing, AI methods have the potential to allow exploiting the full potential of simulations and observations at significantly enhanced scales and to substantially increase the value, which can be extracted from investments into digital infrastructures and hardware. This fusion of models and real-time data is of crucial importance in many scientific areas, which – due to the complexity of the underlying phenomena – are heavily dependent on converging traditional modelling with the increasing amount of real-time data in order to arrive at more accurate present-state assessments and predictions (e.g. high energy physics, astrophysics, environmental research, security applications, materials research, resource efficiency, econometrics, population dynamics and related global changes).
Achieving this will require a co-design approach with user communities. Target should be the development of more integrated systems and a consistent set of standard methods and protocols in the areas of (a) model and data fusion for optimal synergy between observations and models, including provisions to include information from the entire digital continuum (from smart sensors, IoT, big data to citizen science type of information, high-performance computing; and (b) visualisation and artificial intelligence based knowledge generation from spatio-temporal information.
Given the emerging nature of the Digital Twin concept as applied to more complex phenomena, work should also cover the development of quality measures and trust, development of standard quality mapping and indicators for appropriately communicating differences in qualities of inputs and outputs from digital twins, addressing issues such as data and model pedigree, accuracy and lack of knowledge.
In addition to addressing pertinent priority areas in an interdisciplinary manner, proposals should also demonstrate the following:
Deliver a breakthrough in terms of accuracy and realism
Optimally fuse observations and models
Integrate downstream sectors at the source of data production (adjacent science sectors)
Include a rigorous handling of quality and confidence of information
Develop capabilities of the new digital continuum enabling research communities to continuously learn and update themselves from data and information originating from different sources
Work under this topic should reach a sufficiently high TRL level (6-7) to be considered for integration into operational activities of for example existing research infrastructures, the EOSC platform, and undertaken in related fields.
Work under this topic should link to relevant actions, when appropriate, under Digital Europe Programme (e.g. Destination Earth).

Project results are expected to contribute to some of the following expected outcomes:
improved acquisition, quality, interoperability and analysis of imaging data from different disciplines (e.g.: health & food, climate and environmental research, digital transformation);
wider use of image analysis services based on AI in different scientific areas.
Scope:
The availability of high-performance image analysis tools, including those based on AI, through the provision of RI services, has a great potential to improve the use of image data for research purposes. These services enable better use of imaging data by aligning data formats, ensuring better data quality and noise reduction, improving interoperability, applying advanced data analysis, interpretation and potentially visualisation, as well as by integrating imaging data with other data sets of different types.
Use of artificial intelligence as enabler for better exploitation of data sets for research queries will be an important contribution from research infrastructures to the Commission’s AI strategy proposed in the Commission’s White Paper On Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust (COM(2020) 65 final). Proposals under this topic bring together several complementary and interdisciplinary RIs to provide trans-national access (in-person, when the user visits the infrastructure to make use of it or remote access) and/or virtual access to integrated and customised RI services for challenge-driven research and innovation. Access also includes ad hoc users’ training and scientific and technical support. Harmonisation, customisation and virtualisation of RI services will also be supported.
Successful proposals will offer services, including AI-based services for improved analysis of imaging data in different thematic areas (e.g. environmental monitoring, life sciences, chemistry, physics,...). Appropriate links and complementarities must be ensured with the existing AI4EU platform[1] and relevant activities under Pillar II of Horizon Europe.
AI-based tools and services will make use of the EOSC commons as working environment where these tools, services and relevant data sets will be made findable and accessible for use, thus making EOSC operational for the delivery of research infrastructure data services for thematic research challenges.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
The special Twinning call for Western Balkans will contribute to the wide policy initiative to support of Western Balkan countries. The European Commission adopted on 6th of October a comprehensive Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans (COM(2020) 641, 6/10/2020) , which aims to spur the long-term economic recovery of the region, support a green and digital transition, foster regional integration and convergence with the European Union.
Twinning aims to enhance networking activities between the research institutions of the Western Balkan Countries and top-class leading counterparts at EU level by linking it with at least two research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries. Therefore, building on the huge potential of networking for excellence through knowledge transfer and exchange of best practice between research institutions and partners. Twinning actions intend to help raise the research profile of the institution from the Western Balkan country as well as the research profile of its staff including a special focus on strengthening the research management and administrative skills of the coordination institution from the Western Balkan Country.
In order to support reaching the goals of the Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans and to ensure the sustainability of investment in the region, the Commission will propose a dedicated Agenda for the Western Balkans on Innovation, Research, Education, Culture, Youth and Sport ('Innovation Agenda for the Western Balkans').
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved excellence capacity and resources in Western Balkan countries enabling to close the still apparent research and innovation gap within Europe.
Enhanced strategic networking activities between the research institutions of the Western Balkan countries and at least two internationally-leading counterparts at EU level.
Raised reputation, research profile and attractiveness of the coordinating institution from the Western Balkan country and the research profile of its staff.
Strengthened research management capacities and administrative skills of the staff working in institutions from the Western Balkan country.
Improved creativity supported by development of new approaches in R&I collaboration, increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists.
Scope:
The purpose of the special Twinning call is to raise the bar for excellence of all R&I actors in these countries. It will be implemented as one special call for Western Balkan countries with a limited eligibility for hosting the co-ordinator for the following countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia in 2021.
This special Twinning aims to enhance networking activities between the research institutions of the Western Balkan countries and leading counterparts at EU level. It links the coordinator located in a Western Balkan country with at least two leading research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries in the role of the advanced partners. Therefore, it builds on the huge potential of networking for excellence through knowledge transfer and exchange of best practice between research institutions and partners.
Twinning proposals should have to clearly outline the scientific strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the twinning exercise. This scientific strategy should include arrangements for formulating new (or ongoing) joint research project(s) in the scientific area of choice and describe how Twinning will take this research to a new stage, by enlarging its scope and/or the research partnership. If relevant, any links with sustainable development objectives are to be outlined.
Such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of activities to be supported. These should include at least a number of the following: a) short-term staff exchanges; b) expert visits and short term on-site or virtual training; c) workshops; d) conference attendance; e) organisation of joint summer school type activities; f) dissemination and outreach activities. As far as appropriate these activities should take into account the gender equality plans of the participants.
Proposals should also focus on strengthening the research management and administration skills of the coordinating institution from the Western Balkan country. A dedicated work package or task should emphasise specific activities, which will help the staff of the coordinating institution to improve their proposal preparation and project management/administration skills. If not yet in place, setting up/upgrading a research management/administration unit within the coordinating institution would be beneficial. This will be achieved by fully utilising the experience and best practices of the internationally leading partners and is expected to be a concrete deliverable of the Twinning exercise.
A research component not exceeding 30% of the total Horizon Europe grant may include an exploratory research project. This will open opportunities for integrating smaller research projects and by this strengthening the commitment and the engagement of the twinning partners.
The Twinning proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators, such as expected future publications in peer reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new innovative products or services, number of international students and of local students’ national and international mobility, number of women scientists and their roles in the institutions.
It should be explained how the leading scientific institutions in the partnership will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source of increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists. The benefits for the leading scientific institutions and the way they would materialise through the partnership should be substantiated.
Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisations’ commitments through their adopted gender equality plans, and in line with ERA objectives, as far as appropriate.
The research part of the project should be presented through a dedicated work package and plan including the scientific objectives, tasks and roles of the partners.
The duration of the Twinning project should be up to 3 years."

The actions funded under this topic will coordinate national and regional R&I, Education, Culture, Youth and Sport initiatives by pooling resources and contributing to the alignment of national and regional research, innovation, education, cultural youth and sport policies and thus contributing to the objectives of the Widening programme.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Support to the Western Balkans Steering Platforms for Research and Innovation, and Education and Training as valuable instruments of policy dialogue with the region (incl. support to the annual Ministerial meeting of the Western Balkans Platforms on Education and Training, Research and Innovation and Culture);
Facilitation of the implementation of the Western Balkans Agenda on Innovation, Research, Education, Culture, Youth and Sport:
Highlighting the strategic importance of the Western Balkans and facilitating actions aiming to support the region’s EU integration process, covering Research, Innovation, Education, Culture, Youth and Sport.
Aiming to promote regional economic growth and prosperity through planned investments, to be directed towards game-changing innovations and actions that create a sustainable and human centric development and digital future. Support the ongoing process of reforming education, training and research systems, and the development of the cultural and creative sectors with more and better opportunities for capacity building.
Contributing to the closer integration of the Western Balkan partners with the EU’s priorities, most notably the Green Deal, the Digital transformation, including the enhancement of ICT and digital skills along the lines of the Digital Agenda for the Western Balkans and the renewed Digital Education Action Plan, the European Education Area and an Economy that works for and connects people and communities.
Providing support to the accession process and facilitate the association of Western Balkan countries to relevant European funding programmes.
Identification of common priorities agreed among the participating national and regional R&I, education and cultural programmes as well as activities in the field of youth and sport, taking into account international developments where relevant;
Contribution to joint initiatives, resulting in the funding of cross-border innovation actions, design/implement a portfolio of complementary actions which would enable Western Balkans stakeholders and policy makers to better internationalise and integrate in EU actions and policy making;
Implementation of and financial support to other joint activities supporting R&I, regulatory or societal uptake of results.
Scope:
The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the important role of research and innovation to tackle the immediate crises but also to ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery while boosting the resilience of production sectors, the competitiveness of economies, and the transformation of the socio-economic systems across Europe. The Western Balkans are trying to catch up on Research, Development and Innovation (RDI). Closer links between research and innovation and institutional cooperation to produce high-quality knowledge, underpinning economic and societal solutions are paramount to help bridging the R&I gap between the EU Member States and (potential) Candidate Countries. Actions stemming from this Call will foster the capacity building in the Western Balkans to allow successful participation in the R&I process, improve the Technology Transfer Process, promote networking of and access to excellence, thus optimising the participation in and impact of Horizon Europe across the region. Activities from this Call will strengthen and foster the development of the human capital base in the region, they will promote the establishment of open, inclusive and responsible national research and innovation systems, support an institutional change through the development of inclusive gender equality plans in line with Horizon Europe and the ERA objectives, as well as support evidence based policy making.
The expected duration of the project is up to four years.
Underpinning the Western Balkans Agenda on Innovation, Research, Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, this action will foster a comprehensive policy approach, while seeking synergies across the entire Horizon Europe and other EU funding programmes. An action funded under this call will support the coordination and synchronised interaction among a multitude of instruments and programmes targeting the Western Balkans region. This should not only facilitate an increased participation of Western Balkan entities in relevant European funding programmes but also create economies of scale, complementarity, synergies, and avoid overlapping of actions.
An action stemming from this topic will support a platform for the various services addressing education, culture, youth, sport, research and innovation in the Western Balkans in their programming and implementation. All these areas are key for finding new solutions to the challenges we are facing across South East Europe. The actions should also aim to support the implementation of people-to-people cooperation projects with and within the Western Balkans, supporting partnerships between higher education institutions as well as creative professionals and industries and European incubation networks for creativity-driven innovation.
This action aligns with ERA and Widening objectives in that it aims to strengthen links with EU partners and opens up to EU networks, contributes to improving research and innovation management capacities in the Western Balkans, and it supports national policy reforms through targeted actions. A key element in this is the support to the development and implementation of Smart Specialisation Strategies and macro-regional strategies in cooperation with the JRC and the Policy Support Facility.
Initiatives in the fields of research, innovation, education, culture, youth and sport create new opportunities, reduce the skills mismatch, help to tackle climate change, support sustainable economic growth, the competitiveness of businesses and industries and the intercultural dialogue, enables digital transformation and provides better public services for all Europeans. The challenges of today require international efforts, addressing them jointly is in of broader and direct interest.
Proposals are invited to demonstrate engagement from relevant programmes and initiatives to pool resources and to ensure complementarity between activities and policies with those of the Framework Programme and relevant initiatives.
Proposals should seek parallel synergies with national (or regional) research programmes and initiatives as well, where appropriate, facilitate access to resources from national agencies, pertinent foundations, charities and transnational initiatives.
The proposal should also demonstrate potential impact on national, regional and transnational research and innovation.
Participation of key legal entities from associated third countries, particularly from the Western Balkans, is encouraged."

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Consolidated information on initiatives for reforming the assessment of research and researchers, taking better account of open science practice[1].
Connection of existing initiatives at European level, facilitating mutual learning, and stimulating consensus building among the stakeholders.
Pilots on new metrics, methods and institutional changes for reforming the assessment of research and researchers, which lead to better rewarding the practice of open science, as well as related issues such as gender equality, science education, and academia-industry collaboration.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Researchers incentivised to practice open science.
Increased impact of open science.
Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and set it as a modus operandi of modern science.
Scope:
The current evaluation and funding system of research and researchers is limiting open science practice, as it is still largely based on inappropriate indicators, favouring quantity of results of individual researchers rather than quality of (collaborative) open research practice and socio-economic impact of research. For the focus to shift to quality over quantity, and to more efficient and impactful research, changes are required in the institutions performing and funding research and innovation. One way of doing this is for research funding and performing organisations to develop and implement strategies and policies that reward the practice of open science in the evaluation of research and researchers.
A few institutions in Europe, including some universities, are currently taking steps to reward the practice of open science, by reforming the assessment system of their research and researchers. The proposals should build on these various institutional initiatives, on the results of projects funded under earlier Framework Programmes such as the “Science with and for Society” part of Horizon 2020, as well as on policy work conducted by the Open Science Policy Platform and by several umbrella organisations of research performing and research funding organisations. The proposals are expected to support the sharing of information at European level across institutions and umbrella organisations, to identify good practices, and to develop guidance and recommendations on institutional changes with respect to rewarding researchers for open science practices. The proposals should also pilot the development, implementation and monitoring of new methods, associated metrics, strategies and policies, by clusters of funders and/or research performing organisations, for research and research career assessment that integrates open science practices, in several EU member states and associated countries.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes and synergies, applicants are expected to cooperate with projects to be funded under topic HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-01.
[1]Open science practices include: providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software, models, algorithms, and workflows); early and open sharing of research (for example through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, crowd-sourcing of solutions to a specific problem); participation in open peer-review; measures to ensure reproducibility of results; and involving citizens, civil society and end-users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and content, including citizen science."

Improved understanding of the current landscape of institutional scientific publishing activities across Europe.
Coordination amongst institutional publishing services and initiatives across Europe at the non-technological level and improve their overall service efficiency, in particular in a multilingual environment.
Actionable recommendations for strategies regarding institutional publishing in research performing organisations across the European Research Area.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Increased equity, diversity and inclusivity of open science practices in the European Research Area.
Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and set it as a modus operandi of modern science.
Scope:
Recent years have witnessed a sharp increase in open access publishing activities. Commercial scientific publishers and other service providers have turned their attention to open access publishing, responding to increased demand for open access by funders and research performing organisations. Research institutions have also developed their own open access publishing activities and services. These are either new and based on open access publishing, or are existing publishing activities transitioning into the new digital and open access environment. Libraries are often involved, while new types of mission-driven open access university presses are also emerging in Europe and beyond. Such initiatives do not require article fees for publishing, and are often supported by their institutions. They enable open access publishing of journals and other types of outcomes in various languages and are important in supporting multilingualism in Europe. At the same time, they often have not gained the prestige bestowed on established publishing venues, usually produced in collaboration with well-known commercial scientific publishers. Moreover, institutional publishing in the social sciences and the humanities is often in languages other than English, which is both an asset and a limitation.
This action aims to support institutional publishing initiatives across Europe to improve the quality of their non-technological services to researchers, and to overcome fragmentation, specifically:
1. Activities that provide a comprehensive map of the current landscape of institutional publishing activities across Europe, through the collection of robust empirical evidence on service provision mechanisms, funding processes, gaps, among other things to be specified;
2. Activities that improve the coordination, quality and services of existing and substantial institutional open access publishing in EU member states and associated countries. This can be achieved, in particular, by establishing minimum shared standards and good practices for the non-technological aspects of their services, such as developing high quality journal policies and procedures to make services more efficient and more attractive for researchers (editorial scopes, peer-review policies, organisation of editorial and publishing business processes, translation, among others), developing appropriate business/funding models that support the long-term provision of services, etc.;
3. Explicit and actionable recommendations for strategies and policies to be adopted by research institutions to support the further flourishing of their mission-driven, open access publishing activities in a coordinated fashion across Europe.
Duration: The action should be no longer than 36 months."

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Better knowledge on policy deficiencies and better understanding of needs;
Identify synergies between second and third level education, and between education and business;
Contributions to future Policy actions;
Promoting an integrated learning continuum between second and third level education and between education and business;
Convince students and citizens about the opportunities within policy areas such as the Green Deal, Digitisation and Health.
Scope:
Europe needs more scientists and Europe needs a science literate society. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of Europe’s scientists and medics in keeping our society safe and healthy. The comprehensive recovery package to help the EU rebuild highlights the importance and necessity of major EU policies on the European Green Deal, the Digital transition and Health, all of which call for more highly educated European scientists.
In order to increase the uptake in science careers, to feed the talent pipeline, a plan of action is needed to encourage more interest in STE(A)M for young and old alike, with a focus on also increasing female participation and deconstructing gender stereotypes. The use of artistic approaches to STEM involving creative thinking and applied arts (the “A” in STEAM) could prove particularly useful in this regard. Convince students and citizens of the importance of policies such as the Green Deal and Digitisation and the opportunities that exist within these areas. Science is not just about hard science; it encompasses a world of technology not always obvious to the student and undergraduate. It is important to take into account the needs of industry in education and to develop work ready students and graduates. Introduce the concept of open schooling. Support formal, informal and non-formal science education initiatives, in synergy with the European Education Area.
This action should develop and deliver a STEAM roadmap for Science Education in Horizon Europe, in synergy with Erasmus. The action should develop strategies to increase the uptake of science careers to feed the talent pipeline, demonstrate the breadth of content available for consideration, align the needs of society and industry with education to prepare students to become active citizens and ready for the world of work, develop synergies between second and third level education and promote science education mainstreaming in funded projects.
The action should consider current policy initiatives and identify gaps and overlaps or duplication of effort. Reference and consideration should be given to previously funded projects. Applicants should develop links with Scientix[1], as well as with projects funded under SwafS-26-2020 (Innovators of the future: bridging the gender gap), and consider links with other policy domains.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Crises, and in particular health related ones, have become a dramatic reality for the EU and globally since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Scientific knowledge focuses the attention, as it is a key element to address the urgency of the situation in an effective way and improve preparedness for the future. The extremely heavy human, social, cultural and economic consequences associated with the time pressure sets exceptional conditions calling for an adaptation of the way and procedures to work, and decide and prioritise which inevitably raises associated ethical questions. Some research topics have an intrinsically complex ethics dimension, for example research on the imposing of protection measures, health care prioritization, consequences for family life, and gender impacts on health.
In this context, the activity proposed is expected to propose an operational ethics and integrity framework, which preserves the key ethics principles while supporting a rapid and effective response to a crisis and improving overall preparedness.
Scope:
The first priority is to analyse what characterises, from an ethics perspective, a crisis of a global, sudden and unexpected nature of the type of the Covid-19 pandemic, and isolate what are the related ethics and integrity challenges as regards the production, sharing and use of scientific knowledge and data[1] in designing and implementing responses as well as in anticipating future global urgencies.
Derogations of human rights and freedoms, albeit in the interests of the public good, must be temporary, proportionate, used only as last resort, and critically there must be clear transparent criteria for their suspension e.g. in the form of sunset clauses to emergency legislation. The greatest danger – during and after the end of any formal ‘state of emergency’ – is a ‘new normal’ of eroded rights and liberties.[2] For example, the pressing need to collect large amounts of personal data raises important questions regarding the preservation of privacy[3], and should be assessed carefully against the need to ensure information of data subjects and the possibility to pursue alternative means.
An important element that characterises major crises is that they go beyond the impact on the wellbeing of persons and touches the society more globally notably in terms of solidarity and social justice, as well as gender equality. Mid and long-term social, cultural and economic consequences are also more prominent in these unusual research contexts. The issues related to the role of ethics and integrity experts (as advisors, for example), informed consent, undue inducement, the right to know, and to opt out should be among the elements to tackle.
Based on this analysis, the action should draw the lessons and examine how to adapt processes followed under normal conditions (e.g. for informed consent, regulatory approvals etc.).
The scope should also cover the ethics of the scientific work on public health measures (such as behavioural studies, communication strategies, gender impacts on health[4]), including those aiming at an increased preparedness. The objective is to cover emerging ethics issues related to new concepts like “immunisation certification” that are at the centre of vivid debates involving fundamental values.
The action should clearly highlight what cannot be accepted or neglected in the name of coping with the urgency and the magnitude of the impact of a crisis (including the moral distress of the front line personnel, a large majority of which are women). Another important example is the need to always conduct, prior to the start of a research, an independent ethical review, which remains a necessary safeguard for the individuals involved and enhance the trust from the impacted communities and the society as a whole[5]. Emergency needs adaptation should not lower ethics and integrity standards.
The work should be based on existing know how and identification of preparedness need. The joint advise on “Improving Pandemic Preparedness and Management”[6] by the Group of Chief Scientific Advisors (GCSA), the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) and Peter Piot, special advisor to the President of the European Commission, should be considered. In a bottom-up approach, involving all relevant stakeholders (e.g. researchers, research funders, policy-makers, publishers and citizens) through the organisation of participatory events (workshops, consultations, ‘town hall’ meetings) the activities should propose ways and means to encourage changes in the research culture, and promote openness, communication and dialogue. This must be done in cooperation with ENRIO (European Network of Research Integrity Offices)[7] and ENERI (European Network of Research Ethics Committees and Research Integrity Offices)[8]. The cooperation with other relevant networks can be envisaged.
The action should result in (A) the identification of policy options at EU level (including those to address possible legislation gaps) and practical ways to support the work of relevant stakeholders notably the ethics committees and integrity bodies. The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity[9] should be a main reference.
The work undertaken should also result in (B) operational (“how-to”) guidelines to support the work of research teams.
The need to complement the European Code[10] with specific guidelines should be assessed and a proposal (C) for short documents complementing the Code should be made, focusing for example on fast track processes (ethics review, publication etc.).
In addition, this action should produce (D) traditional and online training material (reflecting the guidelines) for students, early career and experienced researchers. Case studies (for example on mobile tracing apps) should be included in order to facilitate practical learning. The material, as well as all other outputs of the action, must be made available on the e-platform Embassy of Good Science[11]. Where relevant the EU Digital education plan[12] should be taken into account.
Although the main focus should be on the recent Covid-19 pandemic, it is also important to have in mind the wider objective of addressing the ethics of global crisis of the same kind (manmade or not). The action should in this regard present a generalised version of the produced recommendations and guidelines and training material.
Publicly available results from relevant EU funded research projects[13] (e.g. SHERPA, SIENNA, Panelfit, SOP4RI) should be taken into account. Structured cooperation with the e-platform Embassy of Good Science and the European Networks ENERI and ENRIO, with clear attribution of research ethics and research integrity responsibilities, is necessary.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, cooperation with actors from China, Korea and/or African countries non-associated to Horizon Europe is required.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Ensuring the adherence to the highest standards of research ethics is a key element of national and EU research policy. Because of its universal impact on our society and its primary role in innovation, the need for ethics rigour, the pillar of public trust in the scientific endeavour, is essential. Overall, research ethics is the foundation of high quality research and a prerequisite for achieving excellence in research and innovation in Europe and beyond.
In order to ensure that the research activities meet these expectations, they need to comply with the relevant legislations (e.g. on personal data protection, clinical trials, animal research etc.) and ethics principles. Assessing the compatibility with ethics principles requires the involvement of ethics experts that usually provide, as an ethics committee/panel an opinion or an approval. These experts, including early career researchers, come from all disciplines in science, from the public and private sector, as well as from citizens associations and NGOs.
Reliability and trust in the quality and expertise of the ethics experts is therefore key. This requires beyond the questions related to the independence and the possible conflicts of interest, that the experts have the necessary knowledge and understanding of the issues at stake to be able to assess the activity under review.
The recent rapid development of new technologies with high potential socio-economic impact[1] constitutes in this regard an important challenge: ensuring that technological transformations go hand in hand with the protection and promotion of fundamental rights thus ensuring that people can prosper, enjoy their rights and freedoms and live without discrimination.[2] In this context, because of the continuous globalisation of the research activities involving those new technologies, the risk of ethics dumping, the exportation of unacceptable practices outside the EU is a growing concern.
The action proposed should address these issues in mobilising the research ethics community and develop the necessary education, awareness and training actions as well as propose possible adaptation of the ethics review process.
Scope:
The first objective should be to identify the main ethics challenges resulting from the most impactful new and emerging technologies, including the specific challenges arising from research activities involving those new technologies in collaboration with non-EU partners and outside the EU.
From this analysis, the action should develop education, awareness actions and trainings for research ethics experts. This should be done by involving the key stakeholders. Structured cooperation with the e-platform Embassy of Good Science[3] and the European networks ENERI (European Network of Research Ethics Committees and Research Integrity Offices)[4] and ENRIO (European Network of Research Integrity Offices) is necessary. The cooperation with other relevant networks can be envisaged. In addition, where feasible these activities should be based on the analysis of case studies, including from non-EU countries where relevant research activities take place, to facilitate the development of practice-oriented trainings as well as the identification of good practices. The material produced, as well as all other outputs of the action, must be made available in the platform Embassy of Good Science, a one stop shop for all Commission produced ethics and research integrity reference materials and trainings, which can be readily used by all Members States and beyond. Where relevant, the EU Digital Education Action Plan[5] should be taken into account.
The action should be based on the results coming from projects funded by the EU[6] on the ethics dimension of new technologies and other relevant domains (notably SIENNA, PANELFIT, SHERPA, I-CONSENT, ENERI, and TRUST) as well as benefit from the work of the project SOP4RI, working on standard operating procedures and VIRT2UE working on a train-the-trainer programme. For the ongoing projects, cooperation and synergies should be established, via a dedicated horizontal coordination work package. This work package should also pay particular attention to the cooperation with the projects resulting from call H2020-SwafS-2020-1 TechEthos, HYBRIDA and ROSiE.[7] The involvement of the stakeholders such as ENERI and ENRIO should also be used to launch a debate on the impact of the new ethics challenges on the ethics review process to determine how its role and working practices could evolve to maintain effectiveness.
In addition, this cooperation with the main actors should aim at disseminating widely the material produced. The action should in this context foresee the training of the 250-300 Horizon Europe ethics appraisal scheme experts, paying close attention to gender balance, as well as to gender equality and diversity related ethical aspects, and make use of their feedback to improve the trainings. More largely, the institutions organising ethics reviews (universities, research centres, etc.) should be invited to ensure that the experts they rely on are also trained, as part of their quality process and standard operating procedures.
Finally, the action should aim at valorising the work produced beyond the community of ethics and integrity experts and in particular by promoting its use for the students and young researchers that will constitute the next generation of ethics experts and reviewers. In this perspective, cooperation should be sought with large university/research networks (such as EUA, YERUN, LERU, CESAER, EARMA etc.) in order to enrich the relevant ethics related curriculum with the material produced by the action.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, cooperation with actors from China, Korea and/or African countries non-associated to Horizon Europe is required.

","29 June 2021
","08 September 2022","ExpectedOutcome:
Disparities in R&I performance are due to, among other reasons, the insufficient critical mass of science and lack of centres of excellence having sufficient competence to engage countries and regions strategically in a path of innovative growth. Teaming is responding to this challenge establishing new centers of excellence or modernising existing ones with the help of leading European partnering institutions. This will help countries to increase their R&I intensity and to attain a competitive position in the European R&I system and globally, especially by becoming drivers of change.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Increased scientific capabilities of the beneficiary institution and the host country enabling them to successfully apply for competitive funding in the EU and globally,
Improved the R&I culture of the country hosting the co-ordinator (indicators such as research intensity, innovation performance, values towards R&I) through centers of excellence as lighthouses and role models,
Stimulus for institutional and systemic reforms and R&I investments at national level taking into account the enabling conditions on governance of smart specialisation introduced under cohesion policy programmes as far as applicable,
Strengthened and mutually benefitting collaboration with partners from leading scientific institutions from abroad,
Development and promotion of new research strands in relevant domains,
Developed and enhanced research and innovation capacities and the uptake of advanced technologies,
Contribution to the achievement of the specific objectives of the supporting national/regional/EU programme as complementary funding,
Enhanced innovation and integration of planned processes, services and products of the centre,
Enhanced co-operation and synergies with other EU projects.
Scope:
Teaming is one of the actions that stimulates Europe exploiting its potential by maximising and spreading the benefits of research and innovation. It is vital for Europe's competitiveness and its ability to address societal challenges.
The Teaming action is designed to support the creation of new centres of excellence or upgrading the existing ones in low R&I performing countries, building on partnerships between leading scientific institutions in Europe and the main beneficiary institutions in low R&I performing countries that display the willingness to engage together for this purpose. This can help countries that are lagging behind in terms of research and innovation performance attaining a competitive position in the global value chains. Leading scientific institutions are advanced and established partners that have developed an outstanding reputation in research and innovation excellence in the chosen scientific domain. Institutions that are still in the process of development or modernisation, e.g. those that are still receiving support as coordinators from widening actions under Horizon 2020, are normally not considered leading institutions, unless a proper justification is provided for in the proposal.
In order to maximise impact of research and innovation on society, environment and economy at large and to contribute in particular to the achievement of the Union’s objectives, Union funding must be coherent and work in synergy. This notion is highly relevant for Teaming action, where a complementary funding from a national (or regional or European or private source) is required. The implementation of Teaming action is expected to become an influential and meaningful bridge particularly between smart specialisation strategies and excellence in R&I with the aim of strengthening the European Research Area and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.
Whatever the source of the required complementary funding, a Teaming project, as a notable flagship in its host country, exemplifies not only the achievements in R&I, capacity building or competitiveness, but also sets and facilitates synergies in practise.
The evaluation of the complementary funding part may use additional criteria required by, where relevant, the Cohesion Policy programmes and/or legislation. The managers of the complementary funding should apply to the operations the categories, maximum amounts and methods of calculation of eligible costs established under Horizon Europe. In addition, they should be able to apply Art.25 (d) of the revised General Block Exemption Regulation.
Proposals may be evaluated by an additional panel of experts with specific knowledge on complementary funding sources.
In the first stage of evaluation the R&I excellence and the conceptual approach for the Centers of Excellence will be evaluated. Applicants have to present a strategic vision on how to develop R&I excellence beyond the state of the art in the chosen domain and on how the co-ordinator will benefit from the partnership with a leading institution from abroad. In addition, the conceptual approach should outline how the access to complementary funding from other sources will be ensured, in the respect of national, regional and/or European strategies or policy priorities (e.g. notably smart specialisation strategies, Green Deal, Digital transformation). Proposals also should sketch out briefly how the autonomy of the envisaged center will be ensured and the necessary human resources recruited and retained.
Proposals invited to the second stage must include an investment plan for the full project including a binding commitment for the necessary complementary funding.
At a detailed level the full proposal should:
Present a strategy for how the centre will develop excellence in the chosen relevant R&I domain that will put it at the competitive edge beyond the state of the art enabling future success in competitive calls,
Demonstrate the growth potential and expected socio-economic outreach of the Centre of Excellence for the benefit of the host country or region,
Demonstrate how the project will contribute to encouraging and supporting reforms of the R&I system at regional and or/national level,
Elaborate on the structure of the consortium and how this will create a win-win situation,
Demonstrate how the newly established/upgraded Centre will have full autonomy in decision-making. In particular, the Centre of Excellence should have the maximum degree of autonomy in terms of taking its own decisions, being in legal, administrative, operational, personnel and academic matters. The Centre should be able to fix and pay competitive salaries for its personnel,
Elaborate on the steps that will be taken to ensure long-term self-sustainability after the end of the Horizon Europe grant,
Propose a robust human resource strategy that addresses gender equality (in line with the research institutions respective gender equality plans) and international component, ensuring appropriate management capacities for the effective and efficient running of the Centre of Excellence,
In order to assure the autonomy of the Centre of Excellence (CoE), if relevant, the project might benefit of having the CoE coordinating the project within the duration of the Grant,
Present an investment plan including the letter(s) of commitment for complementary funding from the competent national/regional authorities or private sources to commit financial resources (e.g. resources coming from programmes co-financed by the ERDF or other sources ) for implementing the future Centre, in particular regarding investment in infrastructure and equipment. The letter(s) of commitment for complementary funding of the project will be an integral part of the evaluation of the proposal,
The grant awarded from the Horizon Europe budget should provide substantial support for the start-up and implementation phase of the future Centre of Excellence including the recruitment of the managerial, technical and scientific personnel. It should also cover expenses related to team members of the future Centre of Excellence (e.g. their salaries, recruitment costs[1], management costs, travel and subsistence costs),
A minor research component can be accepted not exceeding 10% of the total Horizon Europe grant that may include a preparatory research project. Such small research project embedded in the Teaming action should be aligned with the objectives of the project and e.g. serve the purpose of developing and testing new methodologies and instruments and/or the integration of new scientific personnel. If preparatory research activity is planned to carry out, the outline of a respective work plan at an appropriate level of detail should be presented,
The duration of the grant should be up to six years.
Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisations’ commitments through their adopted gender equality plans, and in line with ERA objectives.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This challenge frames the 5G PPP initiative, whose phase 2 will be implemented under this LEIT-ICT Work Programme. The challenge is to eliminate the current and anticipated limitations of network infrastructures, by making them capable of supporting a much wider array of requirement than is the case today and with capability of flexibly adapting to different ""vertical"" application requirements. The vision is that in ten years from now, telecom and IT will be integrated in a common very high capacity and flexible 5G ubiquitous infrastructure, with seamless integration of heterogeneous wired and wireless capabilities. 5G Networks have to cover a wide range of services from different use case and application areas/verticals, for increasingly capable user terminals, and for an extremely diverse set of connected machines and things; to cope with an increasingly cloud-based service access (>90% of the internet traffic will go through data centres); to support a shift from the “Client-Server” model to “Anything” as a Service (XaaS), without needs of owning hardware, software or the cognitive objects themselves. Network elements will become ""computing equivalent"" elements that gather programmable resources, interfaces and functions based on virtualisation technologies, to implement control functionalities ad-how as a function of the use case.
This challenge includes optimisation of cost functions (capex/opex) and of scarce resources (e.g. energy, spectrum), as well as migration towards new network architectures.
A particular issue is to leverage work and results of phase 1 (WP 2014-15)[1] and to accelerate on proof of concepts and demonstrators. Where technological maturity permits, validation of research results, of the most demanding KPI's and of the most promising 5G technology options will be supported by experimental testing conducted in the context of use case in active cooperation with the various potential ""vertical"" sectors driving the innovative requirements. This validation activity is also expected to be boldly leveraged in the context of the important standardisation (3G PP) and spectrum (WRC 19) milestones that will appear over this WP implementation period.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions covers three strands that complement each other. Proposal may address parts of a strand or parts that cut across several strands.
Strand 1 covers wireless access and radio network architecture/technologies:
Novel air interface technologies i) supporting efficiently a heterogeneous set of requirements from low rate sensors including mission critical M2M communications to very high rate HD/3D TV and immersive services; ii) supporting local and wide area systems, heterogeneous multi-layer deployments, assuring uniform performance coverage, capacity, e.g. through advanced Multi Antenna Transceiver Techniques, including 3D and massive MIMO beam-forming; iii) enabling usage of frequency bands above 6GHz, for ultra-high speed access, backhaul and fronthaul, based on fully characterised channel models.
Hardware architectures technologies and building blocks for 5G low cost low-within relevant spectrum range;
(Radio) Network functional architectures and interfaces leading to a stable vision / reference architecture for 5G in support of the standardisation work expected to culminate under the 2017-2020 period. It provides a platform for technical coordination with other 5G initiatives. This architecture efficiently supports different deployment topologies ranging from fully distributed to fully centralised, with reduced management complexity and minimised signalling overhead. It also covers technologies like WiFi. It supports the “5G services and verticals” framework embracing the machine-type of communication services, the Internet of Things. It covers solutions that unify connection, security, mobility, multicast/broadcast and routing/forwarding management capable of instantiating any type of virtual network architecture;
Co-operative operation of heterogeneous access networks integrating virtual radio functions into service delivery networks, including broadcast/multicast technologies (terrestrial and satellite based) and supporting Software Defined Networking (SDN) and virtualisation techniques of RAN functions, providing the environment for multi-base station attachment;
Support of numerous devices with different capabilities, with unified connectivity management capabilities, in terms of security, mobility and routing. It includes cloud and edge computing for low latency requirements and carrier grade communications for Machine Type Communications (MTC) with resource-constrained sensor and actuator nodes with multi-year battery life operation;
Coordination and optimization of user access to heterogeneous radio accesses including ultra-dense networks, supported by intelligent radio resource management framework. This covers the joint management of the resources in the wireless access and the backhaul/fronthaul as well as their integration with optical or legacy copper networks;
Multi-tenancy for Radio Access Network (RAN) sharing, covering ultra-dense network deployments with the ability to allocate traffic to shared MNOs infrastructure while satisfying their SLAs. Load and deployment are key aspects. Impacts in other segments of the network (e.g., backhaul), is taken into account for joint management;
Integration of Satellite Networks to support ubiquitous coverage, resilience, specific markets, and where appropriate further complement terrestrial technologies (e.g. in traffic off loading, backhaul, or content delivery).
Strand 2: High capacity elastic - optical networks
The objective is to support very high traffic and capacity increase originating from an (5G) heterogeneous access networks with matching capabilities from the core and metro environments, at ever increasing speeds and in more flexible and adaptive form. It covers new spectrally efficient, adaptive transmission, networking, control and management approaches to increase network capacity by a factor of >100 while at the same time providing high service granularity, guarantees for end-to-end optimization and QoS - reducing power consumption, footprint and cost per bit and maintaining reach. The integration of such new optical transport and transmission designs with novel network control and management paradigms (e.g., SDN) are expected to enable programmability.
Disruptive approaches for a massive capacity scaling may impact network infrastructure, and system architectures which need to be assessed for integration and migration aspects.
Strand 3 covers the ""Software Network"", including work on:
Software network architecture to support an access agnostic converged core network and control framework enabling next generation services (including services for vertical sectors) and integrating next generation access and devices. The architecture leverages the SDN/NFV paradigm and is able to integrate/manage next generation transport and optical technologies, both for backhaul and fronthaul, to flexibly meet increasing system capacity requirements;
A unified management of connectivity, with end to end security mobility and routing (including multicast/broadcast) beyond current concepts (e.g. tunnelling) for flexible introduction of new services. This aims at a unified physical infrastructure and includes corresponding abstractions – (virtual) resources, functions, hardware etc. – for control and orchestration. Solutions to provision SDN networks across administrative boundaries (e.g. multiple operators, customer networks, datacentres) and interoperability issues between multiple SDN control domains are in scope;
Solutions (e.g API's and corresponding abstractions) that allow re-location or anycast search of services and their components, as a function of the context. This includes problems involved in portability of virtual network functions and naming of deployed functions and services. It supports co-existence of multiple network domains and easy migration;
Scalability and efficiency related to increasing deployment of software-based network equipment and functions as well as corresponding more diverse services and usages. These include ease of deployment of multitenant networks, cost and energy efficiency, ""five 9"" reliability, flexibility and perceived ""zero latency"" where relevant;
Realisation of the ""plug and play vision” for computing, storage and network resources through appropriate abstraction, interfaces, and layering. It covers the full network infrastructure from core network to heterogeneous access, also with integration of the 5G architecture with legacy infrastructure. The target is for a Network Operating System (NOS) with hardware and user interfaces to manage and orchestrate unified access to computing, storage, memory and networking resources. The approach towards a NOS may also be considered in the context of experimental facilities, in view of integrating multiple heterogeneous European experimental facilities. The goal is to allow proper testing and comparison of the different 5G technological components. OSS solutions are preferred;
Management and security for virtualised networks and services to support service deployment decisions related with location and lifecycle management of network functions, and flexible configuration of network nodes. Network analytics tools, knowledge reasoning and cognition, may be extended towards network operations to cope with complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic networks featuring large numbers of nodes, and to correlate all monitoring sources in order to create a real-time supervision of Quality of Service and Quality of Experience. Management of security (privacy where appropriate) across multiple virtualised domains is a key aspect to be cobered by this call.
For the 3 strands above, projects will be implemented as a programme and be expected to actively contribute key horizontal results to the integration process led by the programme level CSA. Therefore all grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to each other and to the grant agreement(s) under the topic ICT-08-2017 a). The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied [2]. International cooperation with clear EU industrial benefits may be considered, preferably with nations having launched strategic 5G initiatives (e.g. China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, USA).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts, in particular for proposals targeting significant experiment/demonstrations activities in relation to well identified use cases justifying higher amounts.
b. Coordination and Support Actions
5G PPP projects will be implemented as a programme through the use of complementary grants and the respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement [2] will be applied. This calls for activities to ensure a sound programmatic view of the implemented 5G Research and Innovation Actions (RIA) and Innovation Actions (IA) results. The proposed support actions shall liaise with the 5G RIA and IA actions to exploit synergies in the implementation of the activities that include:
Programme level integration through management and orchestration of 5G PPP project cooperation for horizontal issues of common interests (security, energy efficiency, spectrum, standardisation, societal impact of 5G…) in support of the commitments of the 5G PPP contractual arrangement and mapping the strategic programme of the 5G industrial Association;
Portfolio analysis, coverage, mapping and gap analysis, roadmaps for key PPP technologies and for experimental requirements and facilities, also taking into account national developments;
Proactive support to the emergence of a 5G PPP ""5G vision"", to key international co-operation activities. A clear proactive strategy is expected to channel relevant 5G PPP project outcomes towards key SDO's like 3G PP (standardisation work expected to start in 2016) and to valorise relevant spectrum work in the context of future WRC's;
Organisation of stakeholder events, including reaching out to users and key verticals;
Monitoring of the openness, fairness and transparency of the PPP process, including sector commitments and leveraging factor;
Maintenance of the ""5G web site"".
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 3 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

The challenge is to develop and validate a new generation of cost-effective ESS technologies integrating hardware technologies across multiple fields eg, multi-modal sensing, actuating, advanced processing, and secure wireless transmission (to network or local infrastructures). Access to advanced electronics technologies by SMEs and academia is a complementary challenge supporting digitisation of industry.
Scope:
Research and Innovation Actions
It is expected that proposals focus on only one of the two areas underneath (a or b).
a) Technological breakthroughs for future ESS leading to further miniaturisation, new functionalities, improved power consumption, autonomy, adaptation and reliability, and secure operation in real environments:
- Development and integration of micro- and nano- sensor and actuator systems in ESS, including sensors exploiting emerging paradigms (e.g. 2D and 1D nanomaterials, spintronics) for ultra-high sensitivity and low power, and MEMS/NEMS-based sensors,
- Demonstrating ESS that brings intelligence and real-time reconfiguration if required to the IoT edge with integration of sensor systems, processors, computing and networking elements with improved energy efficiency and sustainability,
- Advancing comprehensive design, integration and packaging technologies.
It is expected that, while proposed ESS technologies are to be validated via demonstrators operating in laboratory environments (TRL 4), industrial exploitation and application perspectives are clearly identified.
b) Advances in bio-electronics smart systems: Enhancement of the technical capabilities of bio-electronics and connected Bio-electronics and Micro-Nano-Bio Systems through cost-effective miniaturisation, manufacturing and demonstration, leading to high performance in specificity/sensitivity, reliability, time to results and manufacturability. This includes modular approaches with integration of standard components and interfaces as well as platforms where material, IT, communications and sensing/analysis modules are interchangeable. Portability, wearability, biocompatibility, and operation in remote and low resource settings should be considered. Needs of users, both men and women, markets and business cases should be clearly addressed.
Projects should start from experimentally proven concepts and deliver prototype(s) validated in relevant environments (TRL 5).
Issues related to security, safety, privacy, standardisation, interoperability, certification, life cycle, regulation compliance and ethics are to be considered where appropriate (for a and b).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow these areas to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Innovation Actions
c) Innovation Action on Access[1] to Nanoelectronics and Electronics Smart Systems: In the context of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIH) the goal is to support electronic components, sensors, smart devices and systems, including advanced nanoelectronics and integrated smart systems (e.g. Micro-Nano BioSystems). Focus is on (i) access to advanced design and manufacturing for academia, research institutes and SMEs, and (ii) Rapid prototyping production for SMEs and deployment to market. This service also includes activities such as technical support and training.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Coordination and Support Actions
d) Support Action on Electronics
- Reinforced collaboration & cross-fertilisation between projects and representatives of the Electronics areas addressed, namely (i) Nanoelectronics, (ii) Electronics Smart Systems and (iii) Flexible and Wearable Electronics;
- Increased outreach of these actions across Europe, their industrial perspective;
- Establishing of International cooperation in the field;
- Monitoring of technology advances and developments in the field and analysing the European ecosystems (available research infrastructures, competence centres, education, public procurement...) to determine the strengths and possible gaps.
- Elaborating technology and application roadmaps that identify new opportunities for users and suppliers.

Specific Challenge: Cloud computing has the potential to reduce the IT expenditure of the public sector across Europe, while at the same time improving the scope for flexible high-quality new services. However, the adoption of cloud computing services by the public sector is inhibited by many barriers related to procurement, trustworthiness, technical standards and legal terms of reference, risk of lock-in etc. The overall challenge is to overcome these barriers in order to boost the public sector's productivity by stimulating the preparedness for wide adoption of competitive, secure, reliable and integrated cloud computing services. 
Specifically the challenge is to widen and deepen the commitment from the public sector in Europe towards full readiness for the operational uptake of cloud computing services in a wide sense, while considering the different delivery models (private, public, hybrid, community clouds) and services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
Scope:
a.      Pre-commercial procurement for public sector cloud computing services (PCP)
Proposals will define common requirements and terms of reference for future procurement of cloud computing services. This may include standardisation, certification, contract terms and service level agreements for secure and interoperable cloud services. They should build on work undertaken as part of the European Cloud Computing Strategy[1] and in particular on the work undertaken by the project C4E[2]. If relevant and justified, activities can develop on cloud computing initiatives at local, national and international levels. Dissemination and best practice activities must be included, with the aim to expand the number of Member States and Associated Countries committed to prepare themselves for efficient and secure cloud uptake adapted to their needs.
b.      Public procurement of innovative cloud computing solutions (PPI)
Proposals will focus on organizing joint procurement of innovative cloud services by public authorities to better and more efficiently run their services, serve their communities, their citizens and local businesses. These should build upon work undertaken as part of the European Cloud Computing Strategy[3], and, if relevant and justified, on cloud computing initiatives at local, national and international levels. Activities could include the definition of cloud solutions for joint European IT systems and the provisioning of secure private clouds for public administrations.
Expected impact:
         Increased adoption of smart cloud-based solutions for a range of public services, spanning from generic enabling services to specific applications such as culture, businesses, tourism, education, health care, and cross-border intergovernmental systems.
         Improved quality of service from the public sector to the citizen with the guarantee of a high level of security and privacy.
         Improved cost-effectiveness of public sector IT systems through efficient joint procurement of cloud services, e.g., based on the adoption of standardised solutions and mutual recognition of accreditation requirements.
         Proposals must provide an appropriate benchmarking for the claimed impacts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to maintain Europe's position at the forefront of advanced nanoelectronic technologies developments. This is essential to ensure strategic electronic design and manufacturing capability in Europe avoiding critical dependencies from other regions. Advanced nanoelectronics technologies enable innovative solutions to industrial and societal challenges.
Scope:
Projects will aim at demonstrating the viability of new approaches to computing components. The focus should be on demonstrating new concepts at transistor or circuit level which bring the potential of highly improved performance for generic or specific applications. This can be based on materials, computing unit architecture (transistor or beyond) as well as at circuit level. Still the focus is on devices and components, as well as related processing technologies.
The concept validation should be addressed in a controlled environment at a limited scale (laboratory, research line) amenable to transfer to larger scale developments in industrial environments (pilot lines, etc.).
Innovative concepts include, but are not limited to, the design, processing and integration of devices based on new approaches, e.g. spintronics, neuromorphic, resulting in computing devices and circuits. Proposals are expected to prove the industrial relevance of the intended approach.
The scope of the call covers Research & Innovation Actions on
Energy-efficient computation devices beyond the current CMOS paradigm. These can address steep slope devices, quantum bits implemented in solid-state, spintronic-based devices, single electron devices, nanomechanical switches, etc.
Energy-efficient computation circuit architectures. These can be based on the devices above but approaches based on neuromorphic computing or other hardware implementation are relevant.
Specific technological developments may include (i) promising approaches for 3D stacks, both sequential and monolithic to address challenges of compactness, heat dissipation, reduced interconnect length, and (ii) development of cryogenic electronics to support advances in applications to computing (superconducting, quantum computing) or constraints faced in space. The aim is the demonstration of functionality at circuit level by integrating the adequate functional blocks.
Design for advanced nanoelectronics technologies. Focus will be on design-technology solutions for energy efficiency, high reliability and robustness. All above topics can be addressed as well as the issues related to improving the devices and circuits in the advanced technology nodes.
The proposed demonstrations are expected to be validated in laboratory (TRL 4).
Proposal are also expected to specify the road to industrialisation and establish links to applications likely to benefit from the development.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries that have substantial research in the area (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the USA).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address one or more of the following impact criteria and provide metrics to measure and monitor success.
Identify applications likely to benefit from the intended approach with indication of key parameters (power, energy-efficiency, size, frequency, and cost) and quantitative targets to be achieved (figures of merit).
Contribute to the mid-term viability of the European Nanoelectronics industry ensuring that new technologies with high potential for computing emerge in time to be taken up by industry.
Sustain the technological integration requirements by focussing on challenging 3D integration issues as well as for electronics at cryogenic temperature.
Contribute to the European industry capability to design advanced circuits for its needs.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Network and service providers are faced with increasing challenges to manage convergence technologies. On the one hand, technological versatility increases service provision capabilities, with ever raising possibilities to dimension service offer to context and user specific SLA's. On the other hand, convergence technologies are getting increasingly complex, with ever larger integration of multiple technological heterogeneous hardware and software components, and more difficult properties to characterise at scale. The challenge thus tackles scalability and usability of mixed network technological approaches that can benefit from previous research, towards validation of deployment at scale.
Scope:
a. Innovation actions
Strand 1: Ubiquitous 5G access leveraging optical technologies
5G access networks have to dramatically grow in user capacity, quality of service, responsiveness, energy efficiency and number of connected devices while keeping a sustainable cost.
The objective is to develop and assess new optical access network solutions based on integrated optical device prototypes. Novel integrated devices and subsystems may cover new optical transmission, switching and information processing techniques to support key access functionalities such as beam forming, high accuracy cm/mmWave generation and massive MIMO deployments. They may also be based on new network concepts and control architectures. Co-operative radio-optical approaches are seen as very promising, also to cover intelligent interference cancellation. Techniques to map 5G channels to optical transport and a co-design of the optical and wireless interfaces and protocols are also targeted, to increase capacity and reduce latency, especially in highly dense 5G scenarios. The work draws on existing scientific and research results in the field and includes scalable demonstrators validated through typical usage scenario.
Strand 2: Flexible network applications
The work leverages the current intense research activities in relation to Virtualised Network Functions (VNF) and targets development of a multiplicity of VNF's useful to operators, service providers and users. Service providers or third party providers should be able to assemble these virtualised 5G functions as ""network apps"" from an NFV hosting infrastructure, to deploy them in the relevant network nodes, to orchestrate and customise resources to provision user services. The target is for a cloud like 5G infrastructures, supporting network services, resource and service orchestration. This environment also provides an open source development framework for control functionalities and application developments. It also provides the link between the network –terminal functions and the app/content providers towards standards developments. The platform will be opened to third party developers to demonstrate network ""apps"".
For the strands above, projects will be implemented as a programme and will be expected to actively contribute key horizontal results to the integration process led by the programme level CSA. Therefore all grants awarded under part a) of this topic will be complementary to each other and to the grant agreement(s) under the topic ICT-07-2017. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied [1]. International cooperation with clear EU industrial benefits may be considered, preferably with nations having launched strategic 5G initiatives (e.g. China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, USA).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per strand will be selected.
b. Research and Innovation Actions – Cooperation in access convergence
This activity takes advantage of the supporting 5G research and demonstration facilities offered by Taiwan towards collaborative 5G research with the EU, and aims at developing and demonstrating an integrated convergent access across different air interface technologies and the fronthaul/backhaul/core network. Test beds making use of facilities offered by Taiwanese partners are targeted. It demonstrates the capabilities of new spectrum access schemes, including for co-working with the network. A system demonstrator showing applications potential is thus favoured, e.g. for high speed moving vehicles.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2.5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
a. Innovation Actions
Validated access network architecture with integrated optical technologies for the realisation of critical access and transport control function (only for Strand 1);
Demonstration of technological applicability to dense access scenarios supporting the 1000 capacity increase objective (only for Strand 1);
Demonstrated scalability, close to operational context, of the proposed technological approach (only for Strand 1);

Develop competitive cloud solutions based on advanced cloud platforms and services and cloud-based software and data applications, as well as the opportunities brought by considering the edge devices capacities. Such solutions should also address stringent security, data protection, performance, resilience and energy-efficiency requirements to respond to the future digitisation needs of industry and the public sector. Addressing these challenges will also be part of and contribute to the technological ambitions for the Next Generation Internet (NGI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
Proposals will address at least one the following areas:
New modelling techniques and mechanisms are needed to compose and coordinate resources across heterogeneous clouds, including micro local clouds, private enterprise clouds, aggregated and hybrid cloud models facilitating interoperability and data portability between cloud service providers. Techniques that guarantee privacy, security, identity are essential.
Edge computing (fog computing) technologies that integrate the limited memory, storage and computation of fog nodes that are closer to where data are generated into the cloud architecture and allow to make intelligent decisions when to move computation from the edge to the cloud, while taking into account the network capabilities as well as the security and/or sensitivity of data.
New management strategies aimed to design and develop an efficient, coordinated, robust, secure and service agnostic management of the set of resources brought by combining cloud, IoT, Big Data and fog computing. Solutions for consistent resources categorization, abstraction and monitoring are fundamental. Proposed solutions should also envision the development of novel collaborative (sharing) scenarios and innovative service execution approaches that allow the dynamic allocation of cloud services to improve performance, and to facilitate automatic discovery and composition of cloud services at IaaS, PaaS and SaaS levels (Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a Service). The provision and its user-friendly combination, usage and orchestration of such services should particularly look at SMEs and public sector users.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Actions (CSA)

Specific Challenge: The activities supported within LEIT under this topic contribute to the Big Data challenge by addressing the fundamental research problems related to the scalability and responsiveness of analytics capabilities (such as privacy-aware machine learning, language understanding, data mining and visualization). Special focus is on industry-validated, user-defined challenges like predictions, and rigorous processes for monitoring and measurement.
Scope:
a. Research & Innovation Actions: proposals are expected to cover one or both of the themes identified below.
Collaborative projects to develop novel data structures, algorithms, methodology, software architectures, optimisation methodologies and language understanding technologies for carrying out data analytics, data quality assessment and improvement, prediction and visualization tasks at extremely large scale and with diverse structured and unstructured data. Of specific interest is the real time cross-stream analysis of very large numbers of diverse, and, where appropriate, multilingual, multimodal data streams. The availability for testing and validation purposes of extremely large and realistically complex European data sets and/or streams is a strict requirement for participation as is the availability of appropriate populations of experimental subjects for human factors testing in the domain of usability and effectiveness of visualizations. Explicit experimental protocols and analyses of statistical power are required in the description of usability validation experiments for the systems proposed. Proposals are expected, where appropriate, to make best possible use of large volumes of diverse open data from the European Union Open Data portal[1] and/or other European open data sources, including data coming from EU initiatives like Copernicus and Galileo.
Collaborative projects to define relevant benchmarks in domains of industrial relevance, assemble the data resources and infrastructure necessary for administering and validating the benchmarks and organise evaluation campaigns with a commitment to producing public reports on the performance of participants against the defined benchmarks. Since the goal is to create big data analysis and prediction benchmarking environments of sufficient general usefulness to be able to become self-sustaining after the end of funding, proposals will have to provide detailed and convincing exit strategies.
b. Support actions to define challenges and prize schemes for verifiable performance in tasks requiring extremely large scale prediction and deep analysis. Compact consortia are required to organise and run well-publicised fast turn-around prediction competitions based on European datasets of a significant size. Proposals in this category are expected to be short in duration and are not required to provide sustainability strategies past the end of the project.
Expected impact:
Ability to track publicly and quantitatively progress in the performance and optimization of very large scale data analytics technologies in a European ecosystem consisting of hundreds of companies; the ability to track this progress is crucial for industrial planning and strategy development.
Advanced real-time and predictive data analytics technologies thoroughly validated by means of rigorous experiments testing their scalability, accuracy and feasibility and ready to be turned over to thousands of innovators and large scale system developers.
Demonstrated ability of developed technologies to keep abreast of growth in data volumes and variety by validation experiments.
Demonstration of the technological and value-generation potential of the European Open Data documenting improvements in the market position and job creations of hundreds of European data intensive companies.

The challenge is to fundamentally improve the technology, methods, standards and processes, building on a solid scientific basis, and responding to real needs.
Scope:
Research and innovation actions are expected to address cross-sector and cross-border problems or opportunities of clear industrial significance.
These will include (but are not limited to):
Software stacks designed to help programmers and big data practitioners take advantage of novel architectures in order to optimise Big Data processing tasks;
Distributed data and process mining, predictive analytics and visualization at the service of industrial decision support processes;
Real-time complex event processing over extremely large numbers of high volume streams of possibly noisy, possibly incomplete data.
All human factors claims (e.g. usability, maintainability) concerning software to be developed will need to be rigorously tested by methodologically sound experiments with clear plans to recruit adequate numbers of experimental subjects of the required type (e.g. professional experts as opposed to researchers or software developers). Proposals must demonstrate that they have access to appropriately large, complex and realistic data sets.

New advances in ICT technology influence the way software is developed. Software is increasingly becoming a pervasive and enabling technology and the impact of software defined infrastructures in the software development & management processes will span across multiple technology domains (e.g HPC, IoT, Big Data, Cloud, Artificial Intelligence). There is a need for novel and generic software engineering methods and tools that are applicable across different domains and that are complemented by domain-specific software related activities such as those proposed in the past and current H2020 ICT-LEIT Work Programmes.
Future software technologies need to address the transition from modern development processes towards a new paradigm which treats software, data, computing and communication resources as abstract elements. This will enable data to flow freely over heterogeneous infrastructures in a scalable, distributed and human-understandable fashion. To this end, the degree of abstraction in all these elements must be increased without losing controllability or correctness. The challenge would be to support the full software lifecycle in adopting this new paradigm.
In this fast evolving landscape, there is a need for increased software development productivity which can be fulfilled through the exploitation of reusable code and software components from existing code bases (either as open source software or proprietary software shared among closed ecosystems).
Scope:
a) Integrated programming models & techniques for exploiting the potential of virtualised and software defined infrastructures: (Research and Innovation Actions)
Proposals will address at least one of the following areas:
Code and resources (data, computing and networking) abstraction: Advances in how to abstract code and data beyond simple semantic annotations that are expressive, machine- readable and carrying out additional information about execution requirements, network topologies, data sources, etc. The concepts must allow (de)composition and transformation of all aspects involved in the code, including (de)composition of non-functional properties, conversion to different target platforms, restructuring and reinterpretation of data.
Advanced software systems development: Methods for describing software, data and requirements that are necessary to advance software application development for software defined infrastructures. Such methods should enable flexible (de)composition and interoperability of software and data at run-time, thereby adhering to relevant operational constraints and business requirements. To enable development of such complex structures of code and data, programming models must become more abstract and easier to use, following the principles of human thinking, rather than conventional algorithms.
The proposals should demonstrate the applicability and viability of the proposed solution across multiple application domains.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Proposals in this action will address the following area:
Development platforms and techniques for code re-usability, providing the necessary mechanisms for ensuring software quality (development, verification, validation and/or qualification tools), supporting software reusability (storing, tracking, searching and analysing software artefacts) and sustainable community building. Attention should be given in the handling of cross-platform dependencies and in the quality management of software built from diverse components.

Specific Challenge:
As Internet usages are proliferating communications networks are faced with new shortcomings.  Future networks will have to support in 2020 mobile traffic volumes 1000 times larger than today and a spectrum crunch is anticipated. Wireless access rates are today significantly lower than those of fixed access, which prevents the emergence of ubiquitous low cost integrated access continuum with context independent operational characteristics. Communication networks energy consumption is growing rapidly, especially in the radio part of mobile networks. The proliferation of connected devices makes it very difficult to maintain similar performance characteristics over an ever larger portfolio of technologies and requirements (e.g. Ultra High Definition TV vs. M2M, IoT). Heterogeneity of access technologies entails unsustainable cost with increasing difficulties to integrate an ever larger set of resources with reduced opex. Network infrastructure openness is still limited. It prevents the emergence of integrated OTT (cloud)-network integration with predictable end to end performance characteristics, and limits the possibility for networks to become programmable infrastructures for innovation with functionalities exposed to developers' communities.These are key issues for the competitiveness of the communication industry world-wide are globally researched in the context of future 5G integrated, ubiquitous and ultra-high capacity networks.
Scope:a. Research & Innovation Actions: proposals are expected to cover one or more of the strands identified below, but not necessarily all of them.Strand Radio network architecture and technologiesThe challenge is to support an anticipated 1000 fold mobile traffic increase over a decade and to efficiently support very different classes of traffic/services. Actions may address the following topics:- Network architecture,  protocols and radio technologies capable of at least a ten times increase in frequency reuse, making possible low cost spectrum exploitation including for new frequency ranges above 3,6 GHz.  It covers real time and flexible radio resource allocation as a function of traffic/user distribution with possibility to guarantee and differentiate/prioritize quality of service. The work takes into account novel requirements from cloud networking, from a multiplicity/diversity of connected devices and services to be served and content delivery/cell broadcast/caching requirements. Reduction of energy consumption, significant bandwidth increase in current mobile bands and end-to-end latency are key drivers. - Versatile low cost ubiquitous radio access infrastructure equally supporting low rate IoT and very high rate (>> 1Gbit/s) access, enabling service access capability over radio links similar to  those of fixed access and a fixed-mobile seamless access continuum, and integrating satellite access where appropriate;- Flexible and efficient radio, optical or copper based backhaul/fronthaul integration with low latency, compatible with access traffic increase and additional signalling increase for multi cell operations; - Innovative architectures for 5G transceivers and micro-servers, with identification and prototyping of key hardware building blocks supporting low cost implementation of the identified spectrum usage scenarios. - Experiment based research preparing for large scale demonstrator and test-beds, leveraging where possible experimental facilities available in EU Member States or Associated Countries.Strand convergence beyond last mileThe challenge is to support the integration of a ubiquitous access continuum composed of cooperative, cognitive fixed and heterogeneous wireless resources, with fixed optical access reaching at least the 10 Gb/s range and functionalities allowing unified control. Beyond technological aspects, access sharing issues related competition and support of new business models must be part of the requirements. Actions may address: - Solving the management heterogeneity of different technologies and protocols used to deploy fixed and heterogeneous wireless networks; - Architectures to i) optimise the reuse of (possibly virtualised) functionality across heterogeneous access technologies and their location (centralised vs. decentralised) in the network; ii) optimise the reuse and sharing of infrastructures across heterogeneous networks.Strand network management The challenge is to radically decrease network management opex through automation whilst increasing user perceived quality of service, of experience and security. Actions may address:- Novel simplified (low opex) approaches to overall management of the network, addressing both the network level management (e.g. Self-organising networks –SON) and the service level management with metrics enabling to map user perceived quality of services with the state of the underlying network infrastructure and enabling to value traffic data; - Combination of software defined network implementations with autonomic management of resources; - Network security across multiple virtualised or SDN domains, with analysis of risks and vulnerabilities, definition of threat models and authentication mechanisms across multiple domains. Intelligence driven security and data analytics may be considered.b. Innovation Actions: proposals are expected to cover one or more of the strands identified below, but not necessarily all of them.Strand Network virtualisation and Software Networks. Significant work is on-going globally on the way equipment services and network applications can be designed and deployed, with a highly flexible, manufacturer-independent model of controlling reconfigurable resources supporting changing/emerging application requirements. Actions may address large scale validation, testing and standardisation in following domains:- Virtualisation: i) of network functionalities at infrastructure level, with physical resources reused by concurrent processes, with open interfaces (API) virtual machines; ii) of the implementation of network services running on top of the infrastructure, taking a broad approach to network services (routing, NAT, firewalls..), beyond fully programmable nodes as high‐speed, forwarding devices. Migration paths and co-existence with legacy networking devices is to be considered.- Orchestration logic (SDN), enabling network programmability, automation of cross domain network configuration, simplification and programmability of devices, moving towards Operating System (OS) like orchestration mechanism of the software components of the network. Open source approach may be considered.- Tighter integration between the application/service layers and the networking layers, with full landscape aware decision capability enabling improved   reconfiguration capability and time to reconfigure.  - Support of open network functionalities for dynamic integration with third party and OTT cloud environments offering guaranteed and negotiable end to end SLA's including security aspects, and enabling exposure of network resources to third party application developers.c. Support Actions: proposals are expected to cover one or more of the themes identified below, but not necessarily all of them.In order to ensure coherence and maximum impact of the PPP, additional activities are foreseen: - Overall programme integration through projects cooperation agreement and analysis of the outcomes generated by the various PPP projects (project portfolio analysis); - Horizontal supervision of the societal perspective of the addressed technologies- Monitoring of the openness, fairness and transparency of the PPP process, including sector commitments and leveraging factor;- Analysis of international activities in the relevant 5G domains and identification of international co-operation opportunities, in view of fostering global solutions, standards and interoperability; - Support to standardisation bodies through early identification of promising technologies; - Support to spectrum policy: spectrum requirement identification and operational analysis, also covering more efficient use of licensed spectrum; - Development and maintenance of a ""5G web site"" acting as a ""one stop"" shop for 5G activities under the PPP, including also economic, spectrum and regulatory aspects.  - Roadmaps for key PPP technologies and for experimental requirements and facilities
Expected impact:a. Research & Innovation actionsAt macro level, the target impact is to keep and reinforce a strong EU industrial base in the domain of network technologies, which is seen as strategic industry worldwide. Retaining at least 35% of the global market share in Europe regarding future network equipment would be a strategic goal. At societal level, the impact is to support an ubiquitous access to a wider spectrum of applications and services offered at lower cost, with increased resilience and  continuity, with higher efficiency of resources usage (e.g. spectrum), and to reduce network energy consumption.At operational level, following impacts are sought: - 1000 times higher mobile data volume per geographical area.- 10 times to 100 times higher number of connected devices.- 10 times to 100 times higher typical user data rate.- 10 times lower energy consumption for low power Machine type communication.- 5 times reduced End-to-End latency (5ms for 4G-LTE).- Ubiquitous 5G access including in low density areas .- European industry driving the development of 5G standards, at least for the radio part, and to retain control of 5G SEP (standards essential patents),  20% as a minimum.  International co-operation with countries having bold R&D initiatives in the field (Korea, Japan, US, China) may be considered on a win-win basis.- Availability of a scalable management framework enabling deployment of novel applications, including sensor based applications, with reduction of network management opex by at least 20%. Availability of security/authentication metrics across multi domain virtualised networks.b. Innovation actionsAt macro level, the target impact is i) to create an NFV/SDN industrial capability in Europe with European providers able to compete on a US dominated market by 2020; ii) to reach large scale operational deployment of NFV/SDN based networks in Europe by 2020.At operational level, following impacts are expected: - network function implementation through generic IT servers (target) rather than on non-programmable specific firmware (today).- Fast deployment of large scale service platforms on top of network infrastructures, from 90 days (today) to 90 minutes (target).- Trustworthy interoperability across multiple operational domains, networks and data centres. International co-operation with countries having bold R&I initiatives in the field (Korea, Japan, US, China) may be considered on a win-win basis.c. Support actionsThe expected impact relates to the PPP management as a strategic European programme including projects cooperation, exploitation of results, dissemination and standardisation, coherent and systematic research approach, support to roadmapping and constituency building.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe lacks a systematic transfer of knowledge and technology across different sectors and there is an underdeveloped data sharing and linking culture. Traditionally, data has been collected and used for a certain purpose within sectorial ""silos"", while using data across sectors for offering new services opens new opportunities for solving business and societal challenges. The lack of agreed standards and formats, and the low rates of publishing data assets in machine discoverable formats further hold back data integration. The fact that textual data appears in many languages creates an additional challenge for sharing and linking such data. Finally, there is a lack in Europe of secure environments where researchers and SMEs can test innovative services and product ideas based on open data and business data.
The challenge is to break these barriers and to foster exchange, linking and re-use, as well as to integrate data assets from multiple sectors and across languages and formats. A more specific challenge is to create a stimulating, encouraging and safe environment for experiments where not only data assets but also knowledge and technologies can be shared.
Scope:
Proposals should cover one of the following bullets:
Data integration activities will address data challenges in cross-domain setups, where similar contributions of data assets will be required by groups of EU industries that are arranged along data value chains (i.e. such that the value extracted by a company in a given industrial sector is greatly increased by the availability and reuse of data produced by other companies in different industrial sectors). The actions will cover the range from informal collaboration to formal specification of standards and will include (but not be limited to) the operation of shared systems of entity identifiers (so that data about the same entity could be easily assembled from different sources), the definition of agreed data models (so that two companies carrying out the same basic activity would produce data organised in the same way, to the benefit of developers of data analytics tools), support for multilingual data management, data brokerage schemes and the definition of agreed processes to ensure data quality and the protection of commercial confidentiality and personal data. The actions are encouraged to make use of existing data infrastructures and platforms.
Data experimentation incubators should address big data experimentation in a cross-sectorial, cross lingual and/or cross-border setup. This setup should include access to data in different domains and languages, appropriate computational infrastructure, and open software tools. The incubator should make these available to the experimenters, who are expected to be mainly SMEs, web entrepreneurs and start-ups. Experimentation is to be conducted on horizontal/vertical contributed data pools provided by the incubator. At least half of the experiments should address challenges of industrial importance jointly defined by the data providers, where quantitative performance targets are defined beforehand and results measured against them. Effective cross-sector and cross-border exchange and re-use of data are key elements in the experiments ecosystem supported by the incubators. Therefore, the incubators are expected to address the technical, linguistic, legal, organisational, and IPR issues, and provide a supported environment for running the experiments. To remain flexible on which experiments are carried out and to allow for a fast turn-over of data experimentation activities, the action may involve financial support to third parties, in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. The proposal will define the selection process of the experimenters running the data activities for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50 000 – 100 000[1] per party). At least 70% of the EU funding shall be allocated to this purpose. Experiments are expected to run for a maximum of 6 months, while the incubator should run for a minimum of three years. The proposals are expected to explain how the incubator would become self-sustaining by the end of the funded duration of action.[2]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million (for the data integration activities under a) or about EUR 7 million (for the incubators under b) would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
a. Data integration activities
Data integration activities will simplify data analytics carried out over datasets independently produced by different companies and shorten time to market for new products and services;
Substantial increase in the number and size of data sets processed and integrated by the data integration activities;
Substantial increase in the number of competitive services provided for integrating data across sectors;
Increase in revenue by 20% (by 2020) generated by European data companies through selling integrated data and data integration services offered.
b. Data experimentation incubators
At least 100 SMEs and web entrepreneurs, including start-ups, participate in data experimentation incubators;
30% annual increase in the number of Big Data Value use cases supported by the data experimentation incubators;
Substantial increase in the total amount of data made available in the data experimentation incubators including closed data;
Emergence of innovative incubator concepts and business models that allow the incubator to continue operations past the end of the funded duration.

-       Where appropriate, link to and expand the activities of existing national/regional open data incubators.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the process of SME selection for which financial support will be granted. Minimum 70% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to this purpose.
          Collaborative projects focused on innovation and technology transfer in multilingual data harvesting and analytics solutions and services. The projects should have a cross-sectorial, cross-border and/or cross-lingual scope, and take into account the users' and societal perspectives. The driver in consortia should be a core of companies dedicated to focused activities with a clear business perspective with verifiable milestones and market validation.
b.      Coordination and Support Actions
         To lay the foundation for effective exchange and reuse of data assets (including those controlled by the data subject) across: industry sectors, national boundaries and language barriers, public and private sectors. Proposals are expected to:
-       Define the legal/contractual framework that would foster the exchange of data assets and set up pilots of a self-sustaining data market;
-       Attract and involve players from all parts of the data value chain and representing different sectors and markets;
-       Implement a close clustering mechanism with projects arising from the last bullet point of activity a), involving them in experiments, data reuse pilots, business case workshops etc. and taking input from them in designing the legal framework and infrastructure.
         To contribute to capacity-building by designing and coordinating a network of European skills centres for big data analytics technologies and business development. The network is expected to identify knowledge/skills gaps in the European industrial landscape and produce effective learning curricula and documentation to train large numbers of European data analysts and business developers, capable of (co)operating across national borders on the basis of a common vision and methodology.
         To create a Big Data integrator platform with the objective to coordinate and consolidate relevant technology and user communities in any actions supported in Horizon 2020 addressing or making use of Big Data.

European research and development in data technologies produces promising results, but these are not yet deployed at large scale in a systematic manner. The challenge is to stimulate effective piloting and targeted demonstrations in large-scale sectorial actions (""Large Scale Pilot actions""), in data-intensive sectors, involving key European industry actors. The Large Scale Pilot actions are meant to serve as best practice examples to be transferred to other sectors and also as sources of generic solutions to all data intensive sectors.
Scope:
Large Scale Pilot actions should address domains of strategic importance for EU industry and carry out large scale sectorial demonstrations which can be replicated and transferred across the EU and in other contexts.
Possible industrial sectors for Large Scale Pilot actions include (but are not limited to) health, energy, environment, earth observation, geospatial, transport, manufacturing, finance and media. Although Large Scale Pilot actions are required to have a strong focus in a given industrial domain, they may involve cross-domain activities where these provide clear added value. Large Scale Pilot actions will propose replicable solutions by using existing technologies or very near-to-market technologies that could be integrated in an innovative way and show evidence of data value (see the section ""Expected Impact""). Their objective is to demonstrate how industrial sectors will be transformed by putting data harvesting and analytics at their core.
Large Scale Pilot actions are expected to exhibit substantial visibility, mobilisation, and commercial and technological impact. Proposals should demonstrate that they have access to appropriately large, complex and realistic data sets.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrated increase of productivity in main target sector of the Large Scale Pilot Action by at least 20%;
Increase of market share of Big Data technology providers of at least 25% if implemented commercially within the main target sector of the Large Scale Pilot Action;
Doubling the use of Big Data technology in the main target sector of the Large Scale Pilot Action;

Possible industrial sectors for Large Scale Pilot actions include (but are not limited to) health, energy, environment, earth observation, geospatial, transport, manufacturing, finance and media. Although Large Scale Pilot actions are required to have a strong focus in a given industrial domain, they may involve cross-domain activities where these provide clear added value. Large Scale Pilot actions will propose replicable solutions by using existing technologies or very near-to-market technologies that could be integrated in an innovative way and show evidence of data value (see the section ""Expected Impact""). Their objective is to demonstrate how industrial sectors will be transformed by putting data harvesting and analytics at their core.
Large Scale Pilot actions are expected to exhibit substantial visibility, mobilisation, and commercial and technological impact. Proposals should demonstrate that they have access to appropriately large, complex and realistic data sets.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrated increase of productivity in main target sector of the Large Scale Pilot Action by at least 20%;
Increase of market share of Big Data technology providers of at least 25% if implemented commercially within the main target sector of the Large Scale Pilot Action;
Doubling the use of Big Data technology in the main target sector of the Large Scale Pilot Action;
Leveraging additional target sector investments, equal to at least the EC investment;
At least 100 organizations participating actively in Big Data demonstrations (not necessarily as partners of the projects).

Specific Challenge: SMEs represent 85% of all actors in the creative industry sector. They co-exist with global players and often face difficulties in adopting state of the art ICT technologies and accessing finance. Moreover, they operate on fragmented and localised target markets and have to bear high market costs which affect their international competitiveness. In this context, ICT tools and technological innovation are fundamental for the creative industries and their competitiveness. They widen creative possibilities and improve efficiency in all sectors.
The goal is to increase the competitiveness of the European creative industries by stimulating ICT innovation in SMEs, by effectively building up and expanding a vibrant EU technological ecosystem for the creative industries' needs and by fostering exchanges between the creative industries SMEs and providers of ICT innovative solutions.
Scope: The scope is to stimulate the adoption and deployment of innovative ICT solutions by the creative industries SMEs. This can be achieved through collaboration with ICT providers and by accelerating and supporting the growth of European creative industries.
The topic should be addressed by the following actions:
a.      Innovation Actions to support the creative industries SMEs in leveraging emerging ICT technologies (e.g. 3D, augmented reality, advanced user interfaces, visual computing) for the development of innovative products, tools, applications and services with high commercial potential. Beyond the driving participation of creative industry SMEs and the participation of ICT technology providers, the involvement of research and innovation centres is encouraged. Proposals should be clearly driven by user-needs and demonstrate the market demand for the solution and the innovation potential. Solutions should be cost-effective, market-ready and target international markets.
b.      Coordination and Support Actions to stimulate the growth of European creative industries exploiting advanced ICT for the development of new products and services and ICT SMEs innovating in the field of creative industries.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to qualify 5G as a core connectivity infrastructure to address vehicle-to-everything (V2X), both from a technological and from a business perspective, for the higher automation levels (4, 5) defined by the automotive industry (SAE) and for new mobility services. Demonstrating the benefits of 5G connectivity should support innovative business models as ""revenue generators"", opening the door to private investments and to a broader digitisation of the automotive sector. It supports the realisation of the strategic objective of having all major transport paths covered by 5G connectivity in 2025[1] through cross-border trials along roads planned for CCAM deployment (""5G corridors""[2]).
Scope:
It covers the applicability of 5G connectivity to ""Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility"" (CCAM) V2X use cases, taking a broad service approach, including and reaching beyond the safety/efficiency use cases of C-ITS. It aims to qualify and quantify from a business perspective the added value of cellular connectivity compared to pure meshed connectivity or to purely disconnected scenarios, and to enable a wide range of services to connected vehicles in support of innovative business models enabled by 5G connectivity (e.g. new mobility scenario, car as cellular relay node). It takes forward cellular connectivity for vehicles, targeting use cases which are difficult or impossible to realise from a technical or business viewpoint with existing technology and requiring improved performance of typical parameters such as low latency, reliability, security, location, throughput, security.
Validation of 5G in a broad CCAM context is realised through cross border trials along 5G corridors covering significant portions of roads and including the core technological innovation expected from 5G, such as (but not limited to) New Radio, new frequency bands[3], C-RAN, Mobile Edge Computing, network virtualisation, new network architecture, cross domains data flows. Specific requirements of 5G technologies for connected, cooperative and automated driving will be determined. Results of the pilots are used to define options for deployment, taking into account the evolution from earlier cellular technology (e.g. LTE-V2X), and possible co-existence with other technologies (e.g IEEE 802.11p). Cost/complexity assessment of the various technology deployment options is in scope and identifies who has to invest and who will benefit commercially.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 12,5 and 25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Validation of 5G technologies and architecture in an ""extended CCAM"" context, including validation of innovative business models and applicable standards.
- Validated cost/benefit analysis of cross border 5G deployment enabling CCAM along 5G corridors potentially including several operator's domains.
- Availability of deployment scenarios and strategies with broad base industry and administration consensus.
- Identification of spectrum and standardisation gaps with impact at the level of standardisation (taking into account related developments at 3G PP RAN Level) and spectrum allocation bodies. Participation of key European industrial partners of both the ICT and the automotive sectors and with high standardisation impact is desired.

","26 July 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to get the European 5G Vision of ""5G empowering vertical industries[1]"" closer to deployment with innovative digital use cases involving cross industry partnerships. It requires technological and business validation of 5G end to end connectivity and associated management from two perspectives: i) within the set of requirements specific from one application domain; ii) across all sets of heterogeneous requirements stemming from concurrent usages of network resources by different vertical domains.
Scope:
a) Trials of various scales, depending on the target technology, in view of demonstrating that performance conforming to 5G PPP KPIs requirements are met in the context of specific vertical use cases. Target 5G technologies and architectures should also support specific performance requirements stemming from the considered vertical use case.
In addition, 5G technology and architecture trials are also targeting concurrent usage of resource by multiple verticals, addressing the 3 classes of ITU requirements[2] (eMBB, mMTC, URLLC use cases). In practice, the 5G infrastructure (RAN, back/fronthaul, Core) will be shared among multiple verticals and applications, each asking for independent service guarantees and very different service requirements. Operations of one application in one vertical domain should not affect the performance of other domains/applications. The trials should hence demonstrate that 5G architecture and technologies (notably slicing and virtualisation) enabling multi domain management of resources, beyond the ETSI NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) and with cross domain orchestration capabilities are in line with these concurrent performance requirements.
Trials leverage results of 5G PPP phases 1 and 2 and go beyond the proof of concepts of phase 2.
Vertical use cases may focus on those outlined in the 5G PPP White paper ""5G empowering vertical industries"" (Automotive, smart factories, energy, media, smart healthcare) though other may be considered (e.g. PPDR[3]). High density location and very high data volumes applications should be covered, as typically encountered with media/content applications in large events.
Trials are preferably implemented over the 5G end to end platforms developed under ICT-17-2018, and may contribute to 5G demonstration in the context of large showcasing events.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Coordination and Support Actions
5G PPP projects under ICT-17-2018, ICT-18-2018, ICT-19-2019, ICT-20-2019 are implemented as a programme through the use of complementary grants. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. This requires cooperation of the implemented 5G Research and Innovation Actions (RIA) and Innovation Actions (IA) towards joint leveraging of results. The proposed CSA shall liaise with the 5G RIA and IA actions to exploit synergies for:
- Management and orchestration of 5G PPP project cooperation for horizontal issues of common interests (adherence to KPIs, security, energy efficiency, spectrum, standardisation, societal impact of 5G…) in support of the commitments of the 5G PPP contractual arrangement and mapping the strategic programme of the 5G industrial Association.
- Portfolio analysis, coverage, mapping and gap analysis, roadmaps for key PPP technologies and for experimental requirements and facilities, also taking into account national developments.
- Proactive support to key international co-operation activities with a proactive strategy to leverage relevant 5G PPP project outcomes in the context of key standard developments and of relevant spectrum related bodies.
- Organisation of stakeholder events, including reaching out to users and key verticals.
- Monitoring of the openness, fairness and transparency of the PPP process, including sector commitments and leveraging factor.
- Maintenance of the ""5G web site"".
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 2 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
a) Advanced Trials
- Validated core 5G technologies and architectures in the context of specific vertical use cases and deployment scenarios, from high to low density regions.
- Validated core technologies and architecture for differentiated performance requirements originating from eMBB, mMTC, URLL use cases, notably for end to end slicing and virtualisation.
- Viable business models for innovative digital use cases tested and validated across a multiplicity of industrial sectors, including demonstration of required network resource control from the vertical industry business model perspective.
- Impactful contributions towards standardisation bodies, involving vertical actors, for what concerns the second phase of 5G standardisation. Participation of key European industrial partners with high standardisation impact is desired.
- Validation of relevant KPIs[4] with services linked to specific vertical sectors.
- Europe 5G know how showcasing.
b) Coordination and Support Actions
- Organisation of the 5G PPP as a programme with clear links to the 5G Infrastructure Association.
- Maximised output and exploitation of 5G PPP project results in key domains (standardisation, spectrum) through managed projects cooperation on horizontal issues.
- Constituency building, stakeholder support, support to key international cooperation events; dissemination, support to core international cooperation activities, to relevant stakeholder events; definition of future R&I actions.

Specific Challenge: Europe's photonics industry is facing fierce global market competition and has to cope with a very high speed of technological developments in the field. Further major S&T progress and research and innovation investments are required for sustaining Europe's industrial competitiveness and leadership in photonic market sectors where Europe is strong (communications, lighting, laser-based manufacturing, medical photonics, or safety & security) and to exploit new emerging market opportunities.
Moreover, Europe is experiencing the existence of many fragmented and rather uncoordinated developments between many different national and regional players. Europe suffers also from a slow innovation process for turning many good R&D results achieved into innovative products (‘Valley of Death’). Finally, Europe needs to better exploit the large enabling potential of photonics in many industrial sectors and in solutions addressing major societal challenges such as health and well-being, energy efficiency or safety.
Scope:

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Technology capabilities alone are not sufficient to enable future markets development. Robotic technology and systems must be designed, integrated and deployed along functional lines and match much more closely to SME and to general market needs.
Research into promising system abilities such as configurability, adaptability, motion, manipulation, decisional autonomy, dependability, interaction, perception and cognitive ability will play a key role here, as mentioned above.
A key challenge is to revitalise Europe's robot-making capacity.Whilst SMEs are generally regarded as the backbone of EU industry, they are under-contributing to the robotics industry. There is a requirement to stimulate SMEs in the robotics sector to develop novel and innovative technology that has the potential to open new markets.
Underlying these requirements, is a market-driven need for benchmarks as clear markers of progress for any developer, whether SME or large industry. Benchmarking processes that provide consistency and value to the process of technology validation are lacking currently. Developing benchmarks that can be applied across multiple domains or areas of application allowing technical comparison is a priority.
A further underlying need for the robotics community at large is to ensure the safety and security of their developments. Viable safety certification standards and processes (including testing protocols) are critical to the widespread deployment of robotic systems, but are not yet generally available. Such certification processes should cut across different domains and areas of application and need to be developed on a pan-European basis, but with global impact.
Also the take up of robotics systems by public authorities is a challenge, as there are few if any generalised schemes for public procurement. Smart cities will provide a range of different applications where robotics technology may be able to provide opportunities for enhancing the utilisation of existing general infrastructure, ensuring higher levels of service delivery and addressing demographic change.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions on system abilities.
RIAs will focus on advancing the state of the art in the level of smart robotics system abilities. The focus is on the technical challenges; research actions will address cross cutting technology issues that will make a significant contribution to the needs of applications and domains with the highest impact on markets. Proposals are expected to address at least one or a combination of the following prioritised abilities: perception ability which is immune to natural variation (e.g. changing weather conditions); decisional autonomy; increasing dependability levels to the level of graceful degradation; systems that are able to self-verify correct behaviour in safety critical tasks.
The Commission considers that System ability proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported for system abilities.
b. Research and Innovation Actions for SME-based research and for benchmarks:
Proposals should cover one of the following bullet points:
This activity will stimulate SMEs in the robotics sector to develop novel and challenging technology and systems applicable to new markets. Proposals should provide SMEs with access to technical and non-technical support services and technology that are relevant to the new market being addressed. Such services should provide SMEs, who are not necessarily in the original consortium, with facilities to carry out their research more efficiently and may include access to specialised development facilities or technology. Proposals should also identify how they will enable SMEs to access stakeholders in new markets. Proposals addressing extended clinical validation for healthcare are specifically excluded.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 200.000[1] per party). Minimum 50% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.[2]
Development and implementation of robotics application-relevant benchmarks and metrics to assess progress in technologies and systems. These actions should provide qualitative and quantitative information to support the assessment and development of systems addressing step changes and ability levels; they should also help define benchmarks and metrics which are useful to an end user.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 100.000[1] per party). Minimum 60% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported for each of these two bullets (SME-based research and benchmarking).
c. Innovation Actions on shared facilities for safety certification:
Development of testing protocols for shared space cooperative and collaborative systems leading to viable safety certification standards. Proposals must cover a range of domains and applications where safety certification is a market barrier. Potential examples include healthcare and elderly or handicapped care applications, infrastructure maintenance, transport and logistics. The development of common approaches and tools is strongly encouraged.
Proposals are expected to not only devise protocols but to carry out realistic trials to validate them. Proposals are also expected to show how the protocols they devise can match the requirements of relevant standards and regulations or inform the creation of new standards and regulations.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 100.000[1] per party). Minimum 50% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.[2]
The Commission considers that Safety certification related proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 11 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
d. Pre-commercial Procurement Actions:
Demand-driven PCP actions will be pursued in the area of smart cities. Actions will aim at but not be limited to one or several of the following topics: waste management, transport (with focus on smart mobility), the provision of city-wide utilities and services, the provision of healthcare, social care and education (including social innovation). Actions will be expected to show how the PCP instrument and procurers will be mobilised to develop new robotics related solutions in a smart cities context.
The Commission considers that PCP proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
RAS operate through the integration of a wide range of different technologies, as noted above. In addition to the contribution of each of these technologies, it is also important to characterise the overall performance of an RAS in terms of its ability to perform system functions which traverse specific technological capabilities. The specific challenge here is to increase the system ability levels in terms of configurability, adaptability, motion, manipulation, decisional autonomy, dependability, interaction, perception and cognitive ability. Such system abilities provide a basis for setting performance metrics and for specifying desired levels of system performance. Reaching higher ability levels than currently available allows to advance the state of the art and to set future targets for robotic systems.
Multiple-actor systems are composed of many actors who are able to operate independently but together can perform system functions. These actors may be autonomous entities, people, or static systems, including embedded sensor networks and cloud services, working together in the operational environment. The challenge is to develop complete, robust systems through the interaction of these many actors to carry out the system function.
Integrated sets of common tool chains and real-world test installations are increasingly needed to support the development of complex robotics systems. The challenge resides in the need for open development and dissemination of common development tools and the provision of wide access to realistic testing environments for the end user community, especially SMEs. Robot testing and innovation facilities are starting to emerge in Europe but are underdeveloped in terms of their infrastructure and the facilities they offer.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions on system abilities
Research & Innovation Actions will focus on advancing the state of the art in the level of smart robotics system abilities. The focus is on the technical challenges; research actions will address cross cutting technology issues that will make a significant contribution to the needs of applications and domains with the highest impact on markets. Proposals are expected to address at least one or a combination of the following prioritised abilities: robot dependability, social interaction ability and cognitive ability.
The Commission considers that System ability proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported within system abilities.
b. Research and Innovation Actions on multiple-actor systems:
This action focuses on developing advanced multiple-actor systems utilising actors which can operate individually, as members of a team and within a network of other assets in semi-structured, unstructured, dynamic or harsh environments. The system operates through the interaction of diverse independent actors and needs to be robust against errors or the inaction of any specific actor. Proposed multiple-actor systems are expected to demonstrate autonomy over an extended time scale and clearly identify service level gains (compared with current systems) in the application area chosen by the proposal. Systems must be built around identified end user needs and performance should be measured using relevant end user metrics.
The Commission considers that Multiple-actor proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 7 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported within multiple-actor systems.
c. Innovation Actions on systems development technology:
The action will address the open development and dissemination of integrated sets of tool chains and building-block applications which support the construction of complex robotics systems. This will result in a European-level ecosystem of development tools using commonly agreed ways of describing robot systems and system building blocks and their interaction. The ecosystem should be flexible and able to accommodate a diverse range of end application requirements in a broad range of different domains. Proposals must aim at developing such an ecosystem, provide mechanisms for its dissemination and stimulate community engagement in its development and subsequent deployment.
Key to the success of this action will be support for modularity, composability[1], re-usability, ease of use and the adoption of existing and emerging standards within both the system and its components. The action is also expected to build on existing systems and structures.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 250.000[2] per party). Minimum 50% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties.[3]
The Commission considers that System development tools proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 8 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported within systems development technology.
d. Innovation Actions on pilot installations for robot testing:
The action will develop and deploy access mechanisms and supporting infrastructure for single-site[4] pilot installations outside the laboratory for robot testing, based on the needs of end users. Proposals will build on an installation supported through existing EU, regional, national or commercial funding to develop a European accessible facility prioritised against emerging market domains and application areas. In order to ensure real-world conditions, these pilot installations will be based on existing infrastructures such as farms, hospitals / care homes, mines, nuclear sites, undersea sites, collapsed buildings etc. The proposed access mechanisms and infrastructure should provide a low access threshold for SMEs, public bodies and research organisations.
Proposals are expected to provide a support infrastructure including as a minimum: instrumentation of the site; simulation support to allow off-site testing; access to the end user and local site experts, and metrics relating to the functional goals of the end user. The proposal should also address safety certification processes, the development of appropriate performance evaluation measures and application-specific benchmarks. The proposal should identify application-relevant standards and, where relevant, the types of human interaction expected, including the level of social interaction.
Where appropriate, proposals should consider providing sharable standard platforms (hardware and software) to allow organisations offering individual modules or technologies to access the site, rather than limiting access to groups able to deliver whole systems.
Proposals should clearly show how they will assess and, where appropriate, disseminate the results and market impact from trials carried out on the installation. Proposals are encouraged to highlight how deployed system dependability can be enhanced through interaction with the installation.
The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers running the experiments to access the installation for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 150.000[2] per party). Minimum 60% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties. Third party support is expected to cover the development of end user solutions for use at the pilot installation as well as the development of related service-side support that would enable the deployment of the end user application.[3]
The Commission considers that Pilot installation proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 10 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported within pilot installations for robot testing.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key technology for the further development of the Internet and all future digital devices and applications. Driven by the wider availability of large amounts of data and increasingly higher performance computing and networking, AI brings additional autonomy to all types of physical and virtual artefacts and opens the door to a wave of innovations and opportunities. It is already transforming important sectors ranging from data analytics and Web platforms up to driverless vehicles and new generation of robots for our homes, hospitals, farms or factories.
The challenge is to fully exploit the potential of AI in the economy and society. Building notably on Europe's Scientific and Technology strengths in the field, the supported activities should reinforce industrial competitiveness across all sectors including for SMEs and non-tech industries and help address societal challenges (e.g. ageing, transport). The focus is on R&I areas in AI where collaborative work at European level can make a difference amidst the fierce world-wide competition in the field. The ambition is therefore to make AI technologies and resources available to developers and innovators in all sectors and actively engage with a wide user community, including non-AI experts.
Scope:
The ultimate goal is a European AI-on-demand platform mobilising the European AI community to support businesses and sectors in accessing expertise, knowledge, algorithms and tools to successfully apply AI thereby generating market impact.
The platform should:
serve as a central point to gather and provide access to AI-related knowledge, algorithms and tools;
support potential users of AI in order to facilitate the integration of AI into applications;
facilitate the interaction with existing data portals needed for AI algorithms, and resources, such as HPC or cloud computing, and support interoperability.
Research and Innovation Action - Building a European AI on-demand platform
The goal is to develop a European AI ecosystem bringing together the knowledge, algorithms, tools and resources available and making it a compelling solution for users, especially from non-tech sectors. The action should build on and link to existing relevant initiatives, including for instance existing platforms, data repositories, cloud computing, HPC. Proposals will be expected to plan efforts to connect and cooperate with the DIHs, Pilots and other relevant activities of this workprogramme, as appropriate. The action called for is expected to include the following activities:
Mobilising the European AI community including researchers, businesses and start-ups to provide access to knowledge, algorithms and tools;
Defining sustainable processes and structures (governance, access, business models, licensing, etc.) as well as developing a suitable software infrastructure (APIs and tools to aggregate existing tools and algorithms and to make them easily deployable in applications, as well as to access data and computing resources);
Filling important technology gaps through challenge-based and/or user-driven research and innovation efforts. These efforts could have an application or technology focus, covering major domains such as robotics, IoT, CPS, intuitive interfaces, personalised applications, healthcare, manufacturing or agriculture;
Gathering user requirements: based on representative set of its future users (researchers and industry). In particular, the research and innovation efforts expected from this action will have strong synergies with the platform building (providing user requirements, guiding its development, exploiting its resources, and contributing to its content) but additional efforts might be necessary to ensure that the needs of the various types of potential users of the platforms are represented;
Putting in place a comprehensive service layer to facilitate the use and uptake of the platform both by end-users and researchers;
Reaching out to new user domains and boosting the use of the platform. The task may involve financial support to third parties to fund promising projects (selected through open competitive calls) exploiting the resources and services offered by the platform to foster technology transfer of AI-based solutions, in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Conditions. Maximum 3M€ funding could be dedicated to it, with EUR 50.000 to EUR 200.000 per third party[1];
Developing a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for AI including ELSE (Ethical, Legal, Socio-Economic) aspects, taking into account and building on relevant initiatives and strategies (e.g.: Big Data PPP, Robotics PPP, AIOTI , CPS (CyPhERS), cybersecurity cPPP).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to 20 million € would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Building a sustainable AI-on-demand platform, becoming a reference, mobilising the entire European AI community, and ensuring a leading position for Europe in AI.
Reinforcing European excellence and leading position worldwide in major research and application domains, especially through the research and innovation efforts to fill important technology gaps.
Boosting technology transfer of AI, especially towards SMEs and non-technology sectors, and disseminating the economic benefits of AI to a large user base.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: In the last 10 years, European industry (both SMEs and large companies) has made significant investments in OLED technologies, i.e., materials, devices and manufacturing processes. However, major S&T progress and research and innovation (R&I) investments are required in OLEDs, in particular for the realisation of flexible, high brightness light sources over large areas. The further technological development of OLEDs is expected to give Europe a leading position on the world general lighting market and create new manufacturing jobs for novel consumer products. Moreover, the move to OLEDs would help in reducing the amount of electricity consumed by lighting and limiting carbon dioxide emissions.
Scope:Research & Innovation Actions should focus on materials, process and device technology for OLED lighting. The aim is to realise OLED devices over larger surfaces, with higher brightness, larger uniformity and longer lifetimes. A demonstrator should be provided at the end of every project. A specific target for OLED lighting is energy efficacy of above 100 lm/W, considering also improved out-coupling efficiency. The materials have to allow for a competitive lifetime for all colours and white light (lifetime of several hundred hours at 97% of the original intensity). Attention should be paid to recyclability issues and the environmental impact of the materials and systems as appropriate. Proposals should involve material suppliers, OLED manufacturers or suppliers and OLED system integrators.
 Expected impact:

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Europe is facing fierce global competition to maintain its technological leadership in KETs. However, while Europe has excellent R&D results in individual KETs, it often fails to turn those timely into highly innovative products. In particular, Europe fails to bring stakeholders from the different KETs together around new value chains and new business collaborations. These will create value above and beyond the mere addition of individual technologies and are essential for Europe to develop multi-disciplinary technological capabilities and bring into the market new, high value-added products that are manufactured in Europe. By investing more on innovation and in particular on KET deployment projects and integration platforms as well as on KET pilot lines, in particular around micro-nano-electronics, photonics and manufacturing, there will be a direct impact on Europe's global competitiveness – in particular for the SMEs – as well as on Europe's capability to offer new solutions for some of the major societal challenges it faces.
Scope:
a.      Innovation Actions
ICT-KET integrated platforms for the healthcare and food sectors: Further development and validation in real settings of reliable, low-cost micro-nano-bio and bio-photonics systems driven by users. Actions should target the health sector for early or fast diagnosis or monitoring of disease and patient status (clinical trials are excluded) or the food sector for quality, safety and process control. They should include substantiated business cases for the targeted products with strong commitment to industrialise them in Europe.
b.      Pilot lines for advanced KET products
Set-up and validation of pilot production for advanced products. Actions may include also the development of fabrication processes, process qualification, and further process engineering. They should be open access and be driven by the key stakeholders able to set-up and run such pilot lines. Proposals should also include business plans for the further industrialisation of the production processes and, if applicable, for specific planned products, with strong commitment to manufacturing in Europe[1]. Actions should address the following topics:
         Pilot line for OLEDs on flexible substrates: Focus is on introducing volume fabrication (sheet to sheet, roll to sheet and roll to roll) of reliable OLEDs on flexible substrates with low material utilisation. Actions may include also the upgrading of current research pilot lines.
         Pilot line for analytical mid-infrared (MIR) micro-sensors: A pilot line providing foundry services targeting in particular SME needs. Focus is on fabricating processed wafers and mounted / packaged chips for MIR micro-sensor systems addressing high-impact applications, and introducing lower-cost, more reliable and efficient MIR materials in the fabrication process. Open access should be facilitated through appropriate support services and tools, to be validated through pre-commercial pilot runs for external users.
         Pilot line for PIC fabrication on III-V and/or dielectric based platforms providing foundry services for the fabrication of complex PICs (Photonic Integrated Circuits) based on generic fabrication processes. The foundry offer should meet in particular the needs of SMEs. Open access should be facilitated through appropriate support services and tools (e.g. design support, design kits and tools; PIC characterisation and packaging). The foundry offer should be validated through pre-commercial pilot runs for external users.
c.       Coordination and Support actions
Cooperation of scientists, technology developers and providers, and end users for accelerating the deployment of bio-photonics and micro-nano-bio solutions in the health sector.
Expected impact:

         Effective market introduction of new and highly competitive OLEDs and MIR sensing products.
         Measurable productivity increase in PIC manufacturing; and, measurable new, high added-value product propositions in a wide range of photonics market segments enabled by advanced manufacturing capabilities and/or added value services in PICs.
         Improved value creation in Europe through stronger value and supply chains involving relevant industrial stakeholders.
c.       Coordination and Support actions
         Reinforced value chains and accelerated deployment of micro-nano-bio and bio-photonics solutions in the health sector through closer cooperation of the key stakeholders and users.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe's photonics industry is facing fierce global market competition and has to cope with a very high speed of technological developments in the field. Further major S&T progress and research and innovation investments are required for sustaining Europe's industrial competitiveness and leadership in photonic market sectors where Europe is strong (e.g. in laser-based manufacturing, medical photonics, sensing, lighting) and to exploit new emerging market opportunities.
Moreover, Europe is experiencing the existence of many fragmented and rather uncoordinated developments between many different national and regional players. Europe suffers also from a slow innovation process for turning many good R&D results into innovative products (‘Valley of Death’). This requires a joined-up approach, covering missing links in the value chain, such as assembly and packaging of photonics components. Finally, Europe needs to better exploit the large enabling potential of photonics in many industrial sectors and in solutions addressing major societal challenges such as health and well-being, energy efficiency or safety. Europe also needs to better exploit the innovation leverage potential of the innovation clusters and national platforms. The new trend in society of makerlabs and the efforts to create more interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) need to be exploited to generate an increased awareness of and improved skills in photonics.
In order to capitalise on the opportunities coming from advances in Photonics for laser-based production, a topic addressing these is proposed in collaboration[1] with Factories of the Future topic FOF-13-2016 - Photonics Laser-based production.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions
Application driven core photonic technology developments for a new generation of photonic devices (including components, modules and sub-systems): Actions should demonstrate strong industrial commitment, be driven by user needs and concrete business cases supported by strong exploitation strategies, and cover the value/supply chain as appropriate. Actions should address manufacturability and validation of results for the target applications and should include standardisation activities as appropriate. Actions may also include the related materials. Focus is on one of the following themes:
Biophotonics: advancing imaging for in-depth disease diagnosis: The objective is to develop innovative, compact, easy to operate non- or minimally invasive functional imaging systems that are multi-band and multimodal (including photonics in combination with non-photonic techniques) to support the in vivo diagnosis of age and life-style related diseases like cancer, cardiovascular, osteoarticular, eye diseases and various neuro-pathologies, after a positive screening. The imaging system must be either label-free or based on already/rapidly safety-approved labels, and should either address unmet medical needs or support a diagnostic approach which is significantly superior to existing approaches. Physicians/clinicians must be closely involved from requirement specifications to the validation. Validation in clinical settings should be included, but clinical trials are excluded.
Breakthrough in miniaturization of SSL light engines and systems: Research into breakthrough miniaturization of SSL (LED and OLED) light engines and systems allowing for new types or revolutionary designs of luminaires and lamps with new form factors and expanding application fields, such as in automotive, signalling, wearables, and through the integration into building materials in the construction sector. Research on the integration of driver electronics and system and functionality aspects may be included.
Pervasive high-specificity and high-sensitivity sensing for a safer environment: Breakthrough advances in cost-effective, compact, high-performance (both in specificity and sensitivity) photonic devices (including sources) for pervasive (i.e. large area coverage) near- and mid-infrared sensing applications (spectral range of 2 to 12 μm) for a safer environment, such as monitoring of water or air quality at large scale. Specificity and sensitivity levels should at least respect regulatory requirements. Actions should include validation of the device and proof of its suitability for the targeted application. Research on application related computation, communication and sensor system/network level aspects should be excluded, while development necessary for validation can be included. Hybrid solutions where the core photonic technology is complemented with other technologies are allowed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per theme will be selected.
b. Innovation Actions
Focus is on one of the following themes:
Application driven core photonic devices integrated in systems: Focus is on microdisplay-based immersive, augmented and virtual reality visualisation systems. Actions should address validation and demonstration of new micro-display based visualization systems for key applications in e.g. healthcare, maintenance & training, entertainment, tourism or sports. This may include wearable systems, as well as larger projection systems. Actions should also include standardisation activities. They should demonstrate strong industrial commitment, be driven by user needs and concrete business cases supported by strong exploitation strategies, and cover the whole value/supply chain and the end-user.
Pilot line for Assembly and Packaging[2] : The objective is to set-up a pilot line for the assembly and packaging of integrated photonic components. The pilot line should offer generic solutions for a wide class of PICs (Photonic Integrated Circuits) as well as for the more demanding requirements of some selected PIC-based product groups of strategic interest to European industry. It should cover all stages of manufacturing through to testing. From technical as well as from user perspective, it should provide a low entry barrier access to low and medium production volumes, although the available processes should be suited also for scaling to high volume production. The action may include also process and equipment optimisation and qualification, and should include a validation of the pilot line offer with involvement of external users through pre-commercial pilot runs. A credible strategy to future full-scale manufacturing in Europe is expected. The action should deliver the additional knowledge and experience needed for this, be driven by the key stakeholders able to set-up and run such pilot lines, and cover the value chain as appropriate.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million (for theme b.i), and between EUR 6 and 14 million (for theme b.ii) would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per theme will be selected.
c. Coordination and support actions
Coordination of regional photonics strategies: The objective is to stimulate collaboration of photonics clusters to extend the range of Go-To-Market services for SMEs (including access to finance) through exchanging and adopting best practises, to network the SMEs with potential collaborators, business partners and customers, and to coordinate regional, national and European strategies and financial resources to the benefit of the local ecosystem and the regional smart specialisation strategies. Actions should build on on-going support actions in this field.
Photonics enhanced MakerLabs[2] : The objective is to raise awareness, support hands-on learning and enhance skills of students, technicians and young professionals interested in photonics by extending existing facilities in order to provide access to photonic components, photonics-based equipment and related support services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per theme will be selected.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should describe how the proposed work will contribute to the listed corresponding expected impacts and provide metrics, the baseline and concrete targets.

Deadline date","Scope:
1. Background
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of the EU's most important policies. It is a partnership between agriculture and society and between Europe and its farmers. It is a common policy for all the countries and citizens of the EU and benefits them in various ways.
It supports farmers and improves agricultural production, maintains rural areas and landscapes, keeps the rural economy alive and helps tackle climate change and the sustainable management of natural resources.
The Information Measures Relating to the Common Agricultural Policy Programme supports the CAP by funding measures that provide information about it.
2. Objectives — Themes & priorities — Target public
Objectives
The general objective of the call is to build trust within the EU and amongst all citizens, farmers and non-farmers alike. The common agricultural policy (CAP) is a policy for all the citizens of the EU and the benefits that it provides to them must be clearly demonstrated.
The key issues and messaging should be fully consistent with the Commission's legal requirement to carry out information measures on the CAP within the meaning of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
The proposals submitted shall provide coherent, objective and comprehensive information, both inside and outside the Union, in order to give an accurate overall picture of the CAP.
The focus should be on addressing misperceptions and disinformation about European agriculture and the CAP using facts and backed up with data with a view to raising public awareness on the relevance of EU support to agriculture and rural development through the CAP.
Themes
The CAP plays a key role in supporting the EU’s farming sector and rural areas. It aims to ensure a sustainable agriculture with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects.
The proposals for information measures shall focus on illustrating how the future CAP as set out in particular in the CAP strategic plan proposal[1] will contribute towards the delivery of the Commission’s political priorities, in particular the European Green Deal[2]. In the framework of the European Green Deal, the Commission adopted a Farm to Fork strategy[3] and the Biodiversity Strategy[4] for 2030, both of which address issues relevant to agriculture and rural areas.
The Farm to Fork strategy will enable the transition to a sustainable EU food system that safeguards food security, reduces the environmental and climate footprint of the EU food system and strengthens its resilience, protecting citizens' health and ensuring the livelihoods of economic operators. The strategy sets concrete targets to transform the EUs food system and proposes ambitious measures to ensure that the healthy option is the easiest for EU citizens, including improved labelling to better meet consumers' information needs on healthy, sustainable foods. The biodiversity strategy as it relates to farming promotes the uptake of agro-ecological practices and seeks to increase agricultural land dedicated to organic farming.
The future CAP will be an important instrument in managing the transition to sustainable food production systems and in strengthening the efforts of European farmers to contribute to the climate objectives of the EU and to protect the environment, as well as reaching the targets set out in the farm-to-fork and the biodiversity strategies.
Target public
The target public for the themes is the general public (in particular young people in urban areas) and/or farmers and other parties active in rural areas.
More specifically:
For school children, teachers and university students: novel approaches should be used to engage with young people and raise their awareness of the CAP and the contribution that it makes in many areas such as the climate change challenge, food, healthy and high quality eating as a lifestyle choice, in relation also with the EU School Scheme for Milk, Fruit and Vegetables[5] and the Tartu Call[6].
For stakeholders: stakeholders should be more aware of the contribution that the CAP makes to the support of sustainability of agriculture.

The challenge is to qualify and characterise the latest version of 5G specifications as available from 3G PP release 16 early 2020 (5G NR-V2X and beyond) in the context of advanced use cases deployment in Europe of CAM that may also benefit from Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. It targets use cases beyond C-ITS safety applications in view of enabling use cases in the context of complete connectivity-enabled ecosystems around cars and vehicles. It supports the realisation of the strategic objective of having all major transport paths covered with 5G connectivity by 2025[1] through cross-border trials along major transport paths planned for CAM deployment (""5G corridors""[2]) and paves the way towards operational deployment as envisaged with the Connecting Europe Facility proposal[3]. The work is also relevant to cross border railway corridors in view of providing services to trains, including in the context of the planned Future Railways Mobile Communication Systems (FRMCS) planned to replace GSM-R around 2030.
Scope:
The validation of the latest available 5G specification in the context of innovative CAM applications under realistic conditions and seamlessly functioning across borders. This is realised through cross-border trials along 5G corridors[4] covering significant portions of roads or railways and including the core technological innovation expected from 5G release 16 including positioning services, or beyond. Relevant work takes a broad innovation perspective covering use cases in the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), and vehicle-to-network (V2N) domains including the supporting service infrastructure. The work covers the key 5G innovation in support of innovative CAM ecosystems, notably at radio, RAN and core network levels. It also includes supporting innovations in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable advanced CAM use cases managing a broad range of relevant data sets based on connectivity and sensors. It is based on a multi-tenant business architecture that optimises the return on investments and the efficiency of the deployed connectivity and service infrastructure, while considering the opportunity of a European cloud supporting Europe-wide roaming of CAM services. Beyond technological validation, the proposed pilots will allow to better understand the roles, relations and responsibilities of market players and public authorities within the CAM ecosystem.
The work is also expected to provide a clear co-existence between multiple technologies (IEEE 802.11p, C-V2X, 5G-V2X) and migration path towards the use of 5G as the technology for CAM. It targets implementation across different business domains through coverage of cross border 5G corridors as supported by groups of neighbouring Member States. Projects should complement the deployment plans for the 5G CAM trials along the cross-border corridors in scope of the project with long-term roadmaps for the deployment of the 5G infrastructure along the relevant corridors in view of larger-scale testing and early introduction of 5G-based CAM services along these corridors.
The work may include advanced services on board of international trains covering passenger services, train traffic management services, as well as other operational services in preparation for the advent of the FRMCS, including migration from previous generation issues (GSM-R) and spectrum sharing aspects. Aspects of service and infrastructure sharing or coordination for both the automotive and railway use cases, notably in cities, is in scope, as well as multimodal solutions for passengers with the view to offering business continuity to users of the different means of public and private transportation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 10 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals may cover the automotive case only, the railway case only, or both.
Expected Impact:
Validation of latest version of 5G technologies and architecture in a CAM context, including validation of innovative business models and applicable standards.

Modeling is fundamental to drug development. But there is the need to develop innovative methodologies and practices to integrate the ‘omics analysis and network analysis with quantitative mechanism-based models to form a new approach to drug safety assessment. The emerging field of Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) seeks to address this methodological gap via the development of mathematical models that account for the mechanisms underlying the response of integrated biological systems at the level of target cells and organs.
Scope:
The scope of this proposal is to 1) develop Quantitative Systems Toxicology (QST) models for drug-induced toxicity with the focus on four different organ systems: Heart, Liver, Kidney and the Gastrointestinal (GI)-immune system, and 2) use this QST approach for the prediction of clinical toxicity using preclinical data.
Expected Impact:
The results of this action will help to address the needs of the toxicology community for more comprehensive coverage of mechanistic toxicity pathways from which to define a mechanism-based screening approach."

In Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) extracellular depositions of amyloid beta peptides (plaques) and intracellular filamentous inclusions of tau (tangles) constitutes a hallmark of the disease. In Parkinson’s Disease (PD) the neuropathology is defined by intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites). Recently, new scientific opportunities to identify druggable targets have arisen based on the spreading and seeding hypothesis of tau and alpha-synuclein protein as prion-like proteins. This hypothesis allows setup of in vitro and in vivo models based on tau or alpha-synuclein pathological material isolated from patients, animal models or recombinant fibrils seeded into cells or animals and with a resulting defined mechanistic readout (spreading or seeding). Thus, it is envisioned that these models may be used in a screening setup to identify new targets and later validate their druggability. Advancing and focusing the research discoveries to identify drug targets related to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease requires multidisciplinary approaches including targets identification screens, tool compound development and validation in a wide range of experimental cell and animal disease models. The critical mass needed and availabilities of assay, models and reagents are only available through broad collaboration of public and private partners.
Scope:
Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the spreading, uptake, seeding, aggregation, of tau and alpha-synuclein and their impact on cell homeostasis, release and toxicity is still very sparse, hence limiting effective intervention strategies. A key objective of the action will be to use the recent advances in setting up both in vitro and in vivo model systems for spreading and seeding processes. Genome-wide genetic screens and small molecule screens to identify targets and mechanism involved in these processes should be performed. Based on the key mechanisms identified in these screens, targets will be chosen for further validation of drugabbility and therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo.
Expected Impact:
Several outputs from the project may contribute to the R&D process of developing new therapies against PD and AD. Establishing a common preclinical platform of assays based on the hypothesis of turnover / aggregation / spreading of misfolded pathological proteins is important to reach a consensus of how new treatment principles can best be evaluated and substantiated. Such a platform can form the basis for identification of new druggable targets which would open up for development of new innovative treatments against PD and AD."

The development of imaging biomarkers both for the pre-clinic and the clinic has the potential to advance safety evaluation. However, in order for imaging biomarkers to become more mainstream, impacting the drug discovery process more widely, there needs to be technical advances, as well as a better standardization across the imaging community to ensure protocols, biomarkers, analysis and data interpretation are well recognized and equivalent. If properly validated, imaging methods will support establishment of the ADME concept and estimation of toxic effects of drug candidates and could additionally strongly support the efforts to identify the minimal (i.e. safest) dose providing useful therapeutic efficacy.
Please refer to the full topic text on the IMI2 Call 7 section of the IMI website.
Scope:
The overall aim of the proposal is to leverage the potential of available imaging techniques in order to improve drug safety analysis and translatability of findings from animals to humans by validating imaging procedures as biomarker. The output from the resulting project should provide clear evidence that state-of-the-art imaging techniques, when validated properly, can support pre-clinical and clinical drug development and improve safety for individual patients. The following three areas are in scope: the assessment of liver toxicity; lung toxicity and the bio-distribution of biologicals.
Expected Impact:
The information and knowledge acquired will be of outmost value for further improving safety evaluation of novel drug candidates, small molecules as well as biologics. Imaging biomarkers have a strong potential to improve translatability of pre-clinical results to healthy volunteers and patients and thus help to avoid late stage attrition of development programs. In addition, functional diagnostic imaging methods used as biomarkers would offer the possibility to confirm drug toxicity mechanisms in humans, including the potential to determine drug-drug interactions.
The possibility to follow a drugs bio-distribution and its effect on tissues or molecules longitudinally by means of imaging intrinsically includes the potential to reduce animal numbers in pre-clinical studies. Hence the work in this program strongly supports the 3R principle (refinement, reduction, replacement) in substantially reducing the number of animals needed in pre-clinical research.

Publications have previously shown that only 30% of marketed drugs in Europe and worldwide include a paediatric authorisation and less than 50% of authorised medicines commonly used in children had been properly tested in this population. This rate drops 10% in the vulnerable patient population in neonatal intensive care units. Even if the situation may improve with the different paediatric legislation in place, there is still a major societal challenge to be addressed.
There are many scientific and operational challenges faced by both pharma companies and academia when running paediatric clinical trials. Given the paucity of patients available for study in many paediatric indications and the need for multiple capable sites to satisfy enrolment in trials, the clinical trial infrastructure across the EU is not sufficiently organised, and lacks adequate funds and scale to consistently and efficiently deliver both industry-sponsored and academic non-industry sponsored clinical trials leading to new drug approval, complete labelling of existing drugs, valid comparisons between existing marketed therapies, or observational studies informing the natural history of disease indications.
A broad multidisciplinary public-private consortium is required to meet the challenges and be transformative for collectively addressing children’s needs for better medicines.
Scope:
The overall vision of this topic is to create a large collaborative paediatric network that facilitates the development and availability of new drugs and other therapies, and the expansion of knowledge about drugs currently in practice for the entire paediatric population.

The healthy functioning of living cells requires strict control over the import and export of ions, metabolites and nutrients across membranes. Highly regulated transport proteins fulfil this role, and it has been estimated that ~10% of the human genome is linked to membrane transport. The solute carrier (SLC) family is the largest class of such proteins (~400 members), and SLCs play vital roles across practically all cell types in all tissues. The importance of SLCs in disease can be illustrated by human genetic data which suggest that roughly 50% of SLCs are associated with a human disease-related phenotype compared to a rate of only ~20% for the broader human genome. A significant barrier to the study of SLCs is gaining access to relevant reagents and cell systems in which they are expressed
If these reagents become available it will lead to an acceleration in the discovery of effective new medicines for patients suffering from a range of diseases, to the benefit of society at large
Scope:
This topic aims to unlock the therapeutic potential within the SLC gene family by overcoming many of the technical barriers that have hindered their study and prevented their exploitation as drug targets by generating research tools and by making them freely available to the scientific community.

There is a growing body of evidence showing that patient-stakeholder engagement at key decision points throughout the medicines life cycle (from discovery to outcomes monitoring) can drive better innovation and process efficiency and quality. Processes and outcomes become more relevant to individual patients, patient groups, healthcare consumers in general and society at large when they are based on a mutual understanding between patients, other healthcare stakeholders and manufacturers about their respective needs.
Many initiatives have been started that focus on bringing the patient closer to the centre of medicines development, authorization and reimbursement processes in the EU. Progress, however, remains too slow, mainly because of lack of harmonisation:
There is no clear alignment among stakeholders on the nature and value of patient engagement at different points of the medicines lifecycle. This results in inconsistent engagement, often leading to the absence of under-representation of patient insights.
There is a lack of broadly accepted tools, processes, guidance and capabilities amongst stakeholders, resulting in the use of anecdotal and/or fragmented information. Many patient groups lack internal resources (people, time, mobility, legal) and the general capability to engage with multiple and different types of stakeholders.
Perceived or real differences amongst organisations’ conflicts of interest rules block progress.
Therefore, there is the need to establish transparent and integrated standards that permit patient involvement during the medicines lifecycle (including associated products and services). The resolution of 4 specific issue groups is required to make progress: recognition of the validity and value of such engagement; metrics to demonstrate value; capability development; and rules of engagement.
Scope:
In the context of this project, the scope of the term “patient” includes those people who have the medical issues or symptoms as well as those caring for or living with them.
This project represents an opportunity to enable patients to better provide their perspectives - in qualitative and quantitative terms - in the medicines pathways from discovery to outcomes monitoring and beyond. The input from those who are currently under-represented, or may not normally participate in critical decision-making is of particular interest, including patients not affiliated to patient groups, vulnerable populations such as minors or the elderly. In addition, it will provide a framework and guidance for all EU stakeholders about who and how to engage, when and what information is required, to ensure adequate input from patients and healthcare consumers.
The project will specifically aim at addressing several challenges that currently hinder productive patient-stakeholder engagement:
Adoption of practices by stakeholder groups by creating minimum expectations for effective engagement: There are good examples of patient engagement practice. However, the landscape is still fragmented and this project offers the opportunity to make the practices more consistent across the research sector. It will also help to align efforts to measure the impact of specific types of practices on process efficiency, quality as well as the effectiveness of processes, results and decision-making based on the practices. A blueprint representing the minimum expectations on how to engage effectively, when, and with whom) along with metrics are needed to support implementation within industry (including companies operating globally) and healthcare authorities, as well as other decision makers. This will assist to determining the resources and capabilities necessary for implementing patient engagement across the medicines lifecycle. A blueprint which includes metrics will also help patients/advocates to determine where to focus time and resources in order to gain maximum benefit.
Engagement capability: All stakeholders need to have defined knowledge, capabilities and be able to sustain their involvement in order to effectively and routinely be part of the engagement processes.
Rules of engagement: Co-creation involving all the key players is required to ensure that each stakeholder’s perspective is considered and to achieve an ethical engagement. There are practical considerations that need to be taken into account when research and health system decision makers, patients and health advocates are engaged; these need to be more clearly defined.
The project will not address policy development advocacy nor will it duplicate any deliverables specifically addressed under other IMI and relevant non-IMI-initiatives.
Beyond filling obvious gaps in the engagement toolkit/practice, the project will build on existing tools and learn from good and bad experience and advance their utility.
The project’s aim is not intended to set a rigid framework or oversystematise patient-stakeholder engagement but instead to provide a blueprint and tools that will enhance engagement and making it a seamless part of the R&D and decision making processes.
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to advance patient engagement and medicines life cycle and make it more meaningful, systematic and effective. It will facilitate and further enhance patient perspectives in the process. This will be accomplished through creating more clarity on the process and provide patient and their partners in research with the tools that facilitate smooth and useful interaction. Enhanced and systematic engagement of patients and healthcare consumers in medicines lifecycle will ultimately contribute to:
improved and sustainable innovation and meaningful outcomes for all stakeholders;
successfully addressing objectives of IMI to reduce attrition, speed up patient access and improve patient outcomes and experiences.
The applicants will propose a course of action with the maximum impact for the patients’ communities and for the quality of interactions in the medicines lifecycle."

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are common and severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by deficits in social communication and repetitive and restricted behaviours (including sensory anomalies). It is estimated that approximately 1% of children and adults are affected by ASD world-wide; that is nearly 5.5 million patients in the European Union (EU).
Currently, no effective medical treatments for the core symptoms are available and prior drug trials have been largely unsuccessful. Over the past years, major progress in the understanding of the genetics of autism, the development of in vitro and genetic animal models, and identification of several neurobiological phenotypes have opened new avenues for the identification of aetiology-based treatment targets. However, these advances were accompanied by increasing recognition of a further hurdle; namely the profound phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity between patients. For example, approximately 70% of people with ASD have one or more comorbidities. Likewise, hundreds of risk genes have been identified, yet each explains only a small percentage of patients. Last but not least there is poor understanding and knowledge on how the condition and the needs of the patients change in the different stages of life (e.g. in children, versus adolescents, versus adults with ASD). This highlights the need to move beyond one-size-fits-all treatment approaches and to develop stratified approaches that are tailored to the specific needs and biological profiles of particular patient subgroups.
Scope:
This project offers a unique opportunity to create a European-wide research strategy in collaboration and in alignment with US-based efforts that overcome key bottlenecks in the development and testing of treatments for ASD. It will build the necessary capacity, within Europe, for the conduct of future trials, while also contributing towards a more unified approach to research in ASD within Europe in the clinical sciences.
Specifically, to meet these objectives, the project will:
Validate stratification biomarkers to enable identification of more homogeneous clinical and / or biological subgroups for clinical trials, including for co-morbidities, in particular epilepsy, but excluding psychosis/schizophrenia;
Create a European-wide clinical trials network trained to GCP standards to facilitate large-scale clinical trials;
A fully aligned and integrated global framework for clinical trials in ASD and co-morbidities
Enhance drug discovery efforts by testing translatability of drug effects (new and/or repurposed) between patients with ASD with and without co-morbidities and preclinical models to enable and feed a sustainable pipeline of innovative treatments.
Expected Impact:
This project will have a major impact on this field and in parallel contribute towards the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 (IMI2) goals as outlined in Article 2 of the IMI2 Council regulation:
Identify patient sub-populations for particular treatments through validation and qualification of stratification biomarkers.
Development of a Europe-wide infrastructure to accelerate and tailor patient recruitment to targeted (adaptive) clinical trials.
Based on these deliverables, the project will set new standards for industry and allow potential identification of personalised medicines for patients in highly characterized patient groups.
Development of a unified approach to clinical research in ASD within Europe.
A better understanding of common vs. distinct pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ASD subgroups, i.e. genetic, neurobiological and/or accounting for clinical variables such as comorbidities, developmental stage and sex.
The integration in the IMI action of complementary activities conducted in parallel in Europe and the US will result in a significantly larger patient population studied, in the combination of clinical trial results, and parallel validation and regulatory submissions of R&D tools. All this will not only increase the probability of success, but will also contribute to significantly accelerating R&D in a very complex research field."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A key challenge of any research funding scheme is to ensure that significant results, outputs and/or data generated during the lifetime of a project remain available to be further exploited for maximum beneficial impact after the project finishes. Often, important scientific results reach the public domain via publication in relevant scientific journals. However, for some important results – which may include databases, biobanks, new tools, important clinical samples, demonstration models, etc. – the route to becoming available to the wider scientific community or being exploited fully, remains a difficult path. Realising the full potential of a project’s important results within the timeframe available is not always possible and might sometimes only be achieved through the involvement of additional expertise from outside of the project.
Scope:
This call for proposals aims at providing a starting/short term support to develop enabling solutions to ensure that significant results from IMI projects become fully exploitable, available to all relevant end users, and/or fully sustainable in the long term and in their own right. This will ensure that the significant outputs, important samples and/or data that have been generated by the large public-private investments are maintained and made available for future research by the whole scientific community and that important findings are integrated in general research and medical practice in support of the objectives of IMI2. The work to be supported will consist mainly of activities and measures to make the results available to the broader scientific community and as such may include measures to enable technology transfer and the analysis of regulatory aspects, as well as the standardisation and transfer of samples, databases, tools, etc. to sustainable infrastructures. In addition, the work may also encompass further activities should novel solutions/tools/methods be required to achieve the objectives of sustaining the results and ensuring their full impact. These could include adaptation of technologies to enable wider engagement, development of novel standardisation and/or interoperability measures, further development of scientific and business solutions, etc., as appropriate.
Applicants should be aware that only the project results identified in the list of results available on the IMI2 JU website http://www.imi.europa.eu/content/imi-2-call-11 are within the scope of this Call. As such, applicants must clearly indicate through their proposals which results they are utilising.
The relevant consortia will provide the necessary access rights to any potential applicant in furtherance of the call objectives and according to applicable IMI rules
Expected Impact:
It is expected that proposals selected for award under this call will lead to a sustainable future and full exploitation for key IMI project results. It is also envisaged that sustaining these results will stimulate the development of an open innovation model in biopharmaceutical research and contribute to the achievement of IMI2 objectives.
Selected proposals should demonstrate an appreciation of the impact of exploiting the results with respect to long-term sustainability; an impact on R&D, regulatory, clinical and healthcare practice, as relevant; strengthening the competitiveness and industrial leadership and/or addressing specific societal challenges, and improving European citizens' health and wellbeing, when appropriate."

Due to the demographic situation, the older population augments in size every year. Older people are more vulnerable to infectious diseases because their immune system becomes weaker with age. The consequences are that one may observe an increasing burden of infections in the elderly with a high transmission rate. They are often treated with antibiotics causing resistance. In addition, infectious diseases are often the trigger for an underlying manifestation of chronic disease conditions those elderly are suffering. Older people need more costly treatment because of their increased frailty condition.
If infections in the elderly could be avoided, we should be able to delay, reduce, or avoid the exposure to institutionalised health care with lengthy and costly stays related to slow recovery. The situation has not been well studied with enough detail in an integrated way. Rather bits and parts have been assessed but without having a clear overall picture on how this whole process of aging, infection exposure, immune response to vaccination, is developing and potentially evolving. Therefore, before getting to a programme of vaccinating the elderly, we need to study the infection problem in greater detail. We are facing the following specific challenges in getting the full picture well presented:
getting access and demonstrating how to evaluate and report epidemiologic data for obtaining a clear picture on the infectious disease burden in the aged people (50 years +) (trend analysis, frequency, Quality of Life (QoL), and cost) split by specific age and gender groups, vaccine-preventable or upcoming vaccine preventable diseases, and exposure to the health care system (at home care, day care, medical care, institutional care (hospital, recovery));
better understanding the immune response in elderly (65 years +) by deciphering the changes taking place due to age and to other factors, the role of different facets of the immune responses, the role of new immune-modulation techniques, and to explore the potential for developing better vaccines for the elderly;
having disease and economic models available that predict how the current situation may further evolve without any specific intervention, and how we may project a change in disease frequency, cost and QoL of the elderly, if we implement an extended vaccination programme to reduce the burden of infections with the overall societal consequences;
being able to communicate an integrated view of the problem (epidemiology, cost, and QoL burden, vaccine and immunology working, economic consequences of implementing a vaccination programme among elderly) through training and education of health care professionals (HCP).
Scope:
The scope of the action is to:
obtain a clear picture on the infectious disease burden in an aging population (50 years +);
quantify the problem such as number and type of hospitalisations and medical visits when the 50 years + group is exposed to the health care system;
understand this evolution over the coming years;
obtain a better insight in the immune response in the age-group of 65 years +;
develop cost-benefit predictions based on an extended vaccination programme;
better control the burden in that age-group through simulations with advanced disease models, and finally;
develop strategies to educate all stakeholders working with the elderly.
Expected Impact:
Societal gain for healthy aging: Based on the data-collection and model simulation, a recommendation will come out on how to create an optimal vaccination strategy for the older adults. If that strategy will be implemented, an evidence-based vaccination programme for the aging adult will enhance the health condition of the elderly, make important cost offsets in health care, result in benefits in leisure time of the target group and the care-givers, reduction in production loss of care-givers, and improve the quality of care. In addition, an enhanced overall knowledge of what matters among the elderly will be an important societal gain.
Health science development: Agreed-upon standards of analysis and reporting in the field of epidemiology and economic evaluation in people over 50 years old will have a positive impact on the results of vaccination.
Basic research in immunology and vaccinology: It is expected that the results of the project will significantly contribute to a deeper understanding of the immune-response in aging adults. This new knowledge would not be a stand-alone acquisition, but it would instead reside within the frame of a more comprehensive body of knowledge encompassing epidemiology, environmental factors, etc. The results should help to develop better vaccines or better vaccination-schedules/programmes for the target group.
Economic analysis: The elderly are a challenging group to assess in health economic evaluations when it comes to measuring precisely health and health gain. In the elderly the cohort of evaluation is not fixed but reduces over time because of the deaths moving into the absorbing state. Many competing causes of death and interactions between various co-morbidities do not allow a readily available valuation of expected health benefits. This project should allow to more accurately estimate health gains achieved through new interventions like vaccination and cost calculations using more appropriate techniques of modelling.
Communication strategies: Our society is evolving very rapidly in a modern area of communication that is well established in the young generation with the social media. Having a good communication strategy in place will enhance the promotion of prevention strategies such as new vaccination programmes to reduce the burden of infections in elderly.
Through the participation of industrial partners, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), an additional impact in relation to strengthening the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe can be expected.
Interaction with regulatory agencies. It is expected that some of the outcome of the project may be interesting for the regulatory bodies at international (e.g. EMA), national or regional level. For this reason, updates of the progress of the project will be provided regularly as appropriate."

Several challenges have yet to be addressed to better understand the role and alterations of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and transport mechanisms in health and diseases. This is particularly critical for neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer and Parkinson’s diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)), vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis and metabolism-related central diseases (diabetes and obesity). It will be also important to understand the mechanisms of neurotropic virus-mediated BBB and brain penetration, and to be able to apply this knowledge for the development of innovative drug delivery systems, especially for biopharmaceuticals, and the identification of novel drug targets. Furthermore the various transport mechanisms and potential drug delivery systems that have been suggested so far need validation by independent researchers and the further understanding of challenges to advancing into clinical drug development by biotech/pharma.
Scope:
The objectives of the project to be delivered from this topic are:
establishment and characterisation of BBB models relevant for healthy and disease conditions for evaluation of disease-modifying agents (human in vitro cell based, in particular iPSC or progenitor-derived cells, and in vivo);
identification of translational readouts closer to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and mimicking altered BBB under disease conditions;
in-depth understanding of the biology of the BBB and characterisation of various transport mechanisms across the BBB (including virus-mediated BBB and Central Nervous System(CNS) penetration);
discovery and development of innovative and efficacious brain delivery systems.
These objectives could be attained through the milestones shown hereunder. Each of them could represent an independent work package and will be described later in the topic text:
select specific genes and pathways expressed in endothelial cells of normal and/or diseased human brains or preclinical models;
validate in vitro and in vivo that these genes or pathways are responsible for normal/deficient/altered transport at the BBB and the impacts of disease development and progression on these genes or pathways;
this will enable the generation of improved BBB models for neurodegenerative/metabolic diseases predictive for the disease situation with optimized in vitro-in vivo correlation compared to established models; develop in silico models for predicting BBB penetration and pharmacokinetics of therapeutics in CNS;
identify and validate novel targets for brain delivery;
understand the mechanisms of neurotropic virus-mediated BBB and CNS penetration to inform innovative ways of brain-selective delivery.
Expected Impact:
The use of ‘healthy’ and patient-derived specimens, inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones and other types of progenitors offers compelling approaches due to the direct connection to patients with the underlying disease. The impacts of these new models could include: (1) yielding novel insights into currently identified BBB transport mechanisms for drugs, especially biopharmaceuticals, (2) allowing to use comparative assessment between ‘healthy’ and ‘diseased’ BBB, including in silico models, to prioritise some approaches for specific disease(s) because the transport mechanism is modified in the disease state, (3) leading to the identification and characterisation of novel transport mechanisms that are unaffected or upregulated in the disease or neurotropic virus-mediated, making them even more interesting, and (4) facilitating the discovery and characterisation of novel targets addressing the vascular aspect of neurological disorders like AD and thus open up novel routes for therapy."

Currently, published data from placebo-controlled and adequately powered clinical trials in primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (pSS) are scarce. Although specific novel, validated treatment outcome measures have been developed recently, e.g. the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjögren’s syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) and EULAR Sjögren’s syndrome patient reported index (ESSPRI) [4,5], their recent use in clinical trials has yielded mixed results. Important features of pSS such as swallowing difficulties, dietary problems, mental health challenges, sexual dysfunction, dental problems (including tooth loss and decay) are not (adequately) captured. Overall, the utility of the currently available measures (including sensitivity to change in Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and in various ESSDAI domains) in assessing efficacy and disease-modifying potential of an investigational drug is still to be determined. Moreover, no objective validated measure or functional marker of disease activity for assessing therapeutic benefits of improvement is currently available. Sensitive and validated endpoints including objective measures/biomarkers of improvement are needed to increase the likelihood of success of drug development in pSS.
Scope:
The major scope of the action generated by this topic will be the identification, development and validation of pSS-related outcome measures including clinical, PRO, laboratory, bio-behavioural activity and imaging parameters (biomarkers), applying the following step-wise approach:
Data generation and review. Existing data including published epidemiology data, results from interventional and non-interventional studies, and from pSS registries will be reviewed and analysed.
Development of new outcome measures based on the review and analysis activities.
Application and validation by prospectively testing of these proposed new pSS outcome measures, as well as existing ones, in (at least one) dedicated, prospective clinical trial.
Analysis of the outcome of the validation trial and validation of the new endpoint(s). The performance of the new outcome measures or scoring systems will be compared to that of the existing ones, with the purpose to select the most promising outcome measures for future validation.
It is anticipated that the scoring system(s) will require a combination of objective and subjective outcome measures to improve upon existing scoring systems (e.g., selected, core set of ESSDAI domains combined with ESSPRI fatigue or other key PRO items).
If industry sponsored, large e.g. Phase 3 trial(s) are conducted for novel therapies in parallel with (but independently of) the validation trial during the project, the proposed new endpoint(s) may be included as exploratory endpoints in the Phase 3 trials to increase power and robustness of the validation. The analysis of these trials may, however, occur beyond the duration of this IMI action.
Health technology Assessment (HTA) and payer views and expectations will be integrated in determining the endpoints for regulatory approval and market access requirements. Input from patient groups will also be sought and considered in the analyses to capture relevant and currently underestimated or ignored disease aspects.
While the development of the new sensitive and validated clinical endpoints are primarily intended for use in future clinical trials of adult pSS, feasibility in pediatric SS will also be cautiously evaluated for which further validation would be required as part of the project sustainability plan.
Expected Impact:
Expected impact is to enhance the development of new systemic treatments in pSS and to generate evidence for a potential new alternative for consideration by the Health Authorities. .
It is expected to result in more efficient clinical trial designs that will minimize the number of subjects required to be able to detect statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences between treatments. The optimal duration of clinical studies required to demonstrate these differences will also be characterized.
Furthermore, new relevant outcomes will have potential to optimise pSS patients’ management, and large data sets about the natural history of the disease will provide information about the clinical utility of new and innovative diagnostic and treatment interventions in pSS. Engagement of important stakeholders including regulators, payers and patient advocacy groups will help capture all aspects of pSS.
Consequently, improved and innovative therapies are expected to emerge and be available to pSS patients whose health-related quality of life and productivity will eventually improve. Selection of the optimal treatment for the right patient in a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease will be made possible in pSS"

The action generated by this topic will be part of the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR) programme. The RADAR programme aims to test if new pre-emptive therapeutic development and clinical care strategies based on remote continuous monitoring are both scientifically feasible and also practically feasible as part of a wider healthcare system.
Early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are associated with cognitive decline, overlapping with increasing functional decline (impairments in the ability to perform daily activities of living), leading to progressive loss of independence and escalation of caregiver burden and medical costs. While much effort has gone into developing sensitive measures of cognition, today there do not exist similar measures of subtle functional changes in early AD subjects which have direct impact on disease burden.
Recent data from long-term longitudinal cohorts have begun to delineate cognitive domains and functional tasks that are most affected by AD pathology. These include cognitive domains related to episodic memory, spatial orientation, processing speed and functional read-outs such as changes in ability to perform simple financial calculations, ability to use phone/computer, gait speed, driving performance, and ability to adhere to medications, amongst others. In addition, AD and related co-morbidities also have an effect on stress, mood and sleep. Impairment of these cognitive domains, functional capabilities and mood and sleep can be captured by new technology methods such as wearables, mobile devices and home based sensor technologies.
Scope:
Analysis of existing longitudinal AD datasets and disease model(s) to identify functional domains or markers that are specific and sensitive to early stages of Alzheimer’s progression and most predictive of deleterious long-term outcomes such as loss of independence and nursing home entry. Such functional domains should include real-world activities such as ability to perform financial calculations, utilise the phone, navigate around the house/neighbourhood, adhere to medication schedule, interact socially with appropriate behaviour and other performed everyday tasks that require episodic memory and executive function. The applicants should identify and gain access to the appropriate longitudinal datasets that allow retrospective analysis of cognition, function and care-giver/ payer relevant long-term outcomes;
Obtain and incorporate feedback from regulators (i.e. scientific advice) regarding potential use of technology-enabled functional end-points to be possibly considered in future for registration studies of drugs;
Obtain and incorporate feedback from patients, care-givers and payers to ensure that functional domains being measured are relevant and meaningful;
Implement a platform technology-enabled system of sensors and devices to continuously analyse data from identified functional domains, including smartphone, wearable and/or fixed home based sensors. This can concern measures that are passive (e.g. ability to use phone or computer key-board, gait speed etc.), or active (a challenge task requiring financial calculations etc.) with respect to patient interaction;
Validate the platform technology-enabled function assessment system in a real-world clinical setting. This cross-sectional validation study will require short-term (approximatively 3 months) baseline assessment of function to establish a reliable cross-sectional measure of function using the built sensor-based system in cognitively normal, MCI and mild AD cohorts, in addition moderate AD and some severe AD patients will be also included.
The functional measures will be optimized for the following:
ability to best differentiate different stages of the Alzheimer’s disease ( i.e. cognitively normal vs. MCI vs. mild AD vs. moderate AD ). Main focus will be to identify functional measures that best separate cognitively normal from early MCI patients;
ability to show sensitivity to changes using appropriate modelling-based approaches;
correlation with cognitive domains known to be effected in AD (e.g. episodic memory);
correlation with established paper and pencil (self-reported) scales to measure function and cognition in AD;
correlations with known risk factors for AD (BMI, physical exercise, sleep, etc)) for the possible identification of a putative pre-symptomatic cohort;
correlation with known biomarkers of pathology, such as Positron Emission Tamography (PET) and Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF) measure, or clinical scale (ADAS-Cog) if available;
correlation with care-giver burden and health care utilization costs;
ease of use and adherence by technology users in real-world clinical settings
Expected Impact:
Development of objective and sensitive functional measures will enable potential dementia therapies to demonstrate functional impact and clinical meaningfulness of early intervention without requiring long follow-on studies thus reducing time and cost required to bring Alzheimer’s disease modifying drugs to market.
An objective, scalable, platform technology-enabled functional assessment system will also allow measurement of real-world impact of disease trajectory on individual patients in home and care-giver settings and help direct scalable and customized interventions that target specific functional deficits that promote independent living thus reducing cost and care-giving burden. Another valuable impact would be given by integrating organisations, e.g. Small-Medium-Size Enterprises (SMEs), having expertise in developing sensors and also in the area of processing and analyzinganalysing the data from sensors/ devices related to the scope of measuring the functional decline due to Alzheimer disease, as well as addressing the specific problem of the digital platform/user interface for these populations.
Furthermore, adding AD to the RADAR programme will make the entire system more attractive to professionals involved in dementia care, thus helping with the dissemination and adoption of the entire RADAR platform, ensuring interoperability and technology -evolution without disrupting the continuous build-up and extension of the knowledge collection and research practices across the whole RADAR scope (i.e. without having to resort to ad-hoc, un-reusable solutions for specific research topics, with their own visualisation etc.).
The system created via the RADAR–AD topic has the potential to become a widely used tool to measure and help improve quality of life in elder care homes and assisted-living facilities that focus on dementia and other age-related causes of functional decline."

","16 May 2018","Specific Challenge:
Since 2008, numerous IMI consortia have been generating results in a diverse set of biomedical domains. In many projects these results have been stored in a custom database, sufficient for the project itself but difficult to access by scientists outside the project. The same is true for many internal industry research and development databases.
Making a significant portion of the data from IMI projects accessible and interoperable with other datasets and databases will greatly improve the use and impact of the data for translational biomedical research.
The concept of FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is perfectly suited for this task
Scope:
The project will focus on IMI projects that have data that is scientifically valuable and amenable to being made FAIR. It is expected that the databases of more than 20 IMI projects will be made FAIR in this project. All IMI projects will be assessed for the presence of such data that requires FAIRification, though it should be noted that IMI2 projects are already required to manage their data according to similar protocols.
Expected Impact:
Allow the scientific community to maximally leverage data from legacy and current IMI projects.
Strong increase of expertise in creation, curation, and stewardship of FAIR databases within IT communities.
Building skills and increasing competiveness for SMEs in Europe.
Allow the SME community to make their data, analysis tools and services better connected and aligned to pharma data and facilitate future collaboration.
Interoperability of the databases will allow sophisticated data analysis in all phases of drug discovery, including advanced analytical methods such as computer reasoning and inferencing.
The project will have a significant impact on the scientific community regarding the broad adaptation of FAIR data stewardship."

","16 May 2018","Specific Challenge:
Healthcare data are very fragmented. Even data within one healthcare centre are typically spread across different repositories. Across entities, different standards are used to code diagnosis, lab results, drugs or procedures. In most healthcare systems, a majority of the core clinical data is buried in unstructured (text) notes, making data analysis even more challenging.
The EHDN will provide a harmonised model to address the structural heterogeneity and the use of different coding standards, expediting efficiencies in the research process
Besides the technical heterogeneity amongst data sources, a similar diversity in governance processes to perform studies using data collected by healthcare providers, can be seen.
The EHDN will specifically seek to provide a pragmatic governance framework that can be used to accommodate cross-centre studies, within the confines of societal parameters that manage data use in the EU.
Scope:
The first goal of the EHDN is to ‘reduce to practice’ the approaches pioneered in these earlier research projects and develop a standard methodology.
The second goal of EHDN is to help mature both the supply side and the demand side of this ‘health data eco-system’ in compliance with robust privacy and ethics governance.
The third goal of EHDN is to stimulate development of new and augmented health services through available and expanded technologies, in the interest of health outcomes.
Expected Impact:
The EHDN project aims to improve Europe's (technical) capabilities to undertake systematic health outcomes research at an unprecedented scale across the entire region..
The aim of the EHDN is to not just create a network of data providers that are making data available, but also to facilitate further research that will allow these data providers to gain additional value while working towards a value based outcome mandate.
Data providers should find it easier to also participate in other future research studies.
This project should therefore also result in an increased use of outcomes based models in actual healthcare delivery and regulatory/HTA decision making

","07 November 2019","Specific Challenge:
The prevalence of obesity is increasing and affects more than 650 million people of all ages to become one of the foremost global health threats. Obesity is complex and we only have a crude understanding of its underlying causes and biology, how to best describe and define it. Currently we have no way of predicting who will respond to or benefit from what kind of treatment or intervention.
Obesity can seriously impair health through a broad range of complications such as cardiovascular disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, psychosocial imbalances, and reduced quality of life, and impacts the treatment of other conditions.
There is therefore a need to better understand obesity and define clinically meaningful and relevant subgroups as a premise for optimising future prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.
For complete information please see the IMI2 Call 17 topic text.
Scope:
The overall aim is to identify pathophysiologically and clinically meaningful subgroups of obesity that will allow for optimisation of prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications. This will be done by pooling cohorts from observational or interventional studies to establish a federated database with enough clinical phenotyping and multi-omics data for a data-driven stratification of obesity into subgroups. It will also address specifically type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as examples of conditions in which both clinical phenotype and treatment is influenced by obesity in an intricate manner, including public education about obesity in T1D.
For complete information please see the IMI2 Call 17 topic text.
Expected Impact:
This topic should pave the way for an optimised and more personalised future obesity treatment. Deciphering the heterogeneity of obesity and the potentially differential effect of weight loss and weight maintenance should lead for instance to:
increased understanding and respect for obesity as a chronic disease entity;
potential for novel and innovative diagnostics for classification and evaluation of the obesity disease;
increased potential to contribute to the development of more targeted prevention and lifestyle interventions;
increased potential to develop targeted delivery of safe and effective treatments to clinically meaningful subgroups of patients with obesity;
increased understanding of how obesity impacts other diseases as exemplified by impact on incidence, characteristics, treatment, costs, and outcomes of e.g. T1D.

","07 November 2019","Specific Challenge:
In biomedicine, discoveries arising from novel enabling technologies and reagents have garnered a quarter of the Nobel Prizes for chemistry and medicine in this century. Among the myriad of these transformative techniques and reagents, bibliometric evidence shows that pharmacological modulators (chemical and biological probes) have both the greatest scientific citation impact, the greatest sway on exploratory biomedical research, and provide the best mechanism to understand the relevance of a protein as a potential drug target. Indeed, the field of drug discovery and the development of new molecular entities are predicated on the availability of sound mechanistic principles. Unfortunately, our understanding of human disease remains inadequate, and as a result clinical success rates for novel mechanisms remain low. Currently only one out of ten clinical drug candidates reaches the Open Access Chemogenomics Library and Chemical Probes for the Druggable Genome market after an average of 10 years and at a cost of at least EUR 2 billion in R&D expenses per drug.

Scope:
The overall aim of this topic will be as follows:
establish a framework to assemble an open-access chemogenomics library for the druggable genome – namely a physical library supported by compound meta-data;
further enrich the open access library by inventing new, deeply characterised chemical probes to selected specific protein families;
develop open-access assays from well characterised human disease tissue with a special emphasis on immunology, oncology (including immune-oncology) and neuroscience to profile the chemical tools and chemical probes;
establish sustainable infrastructure, with high priority on accessible platforms and appropriate governance, for prolonged discovery and dissemination of tool compounds, assays, and associated data, beyond the lifetime of this project;
develop a communication plan to facilitate the dissemination of the compound sets and to ensure their appropriate use.

Expected Impact:
This project will provide the wider academic community with unencumbered access to the highest quality tool compounds for a large number of novel targets, and the expected impact should therefore be transformative. Presently, many companies and organisations are already in the process of setting up their own chemogenomics libraries. Although these have the potential to be phenomenal resources for the companies, their utility is also limited: they are not widely available to academia, they are likely to overlap, and each compound set is not as deeply characterised as could be managed within a larger, more focused, more resourced and more transparent project. By making a high-quality, broader compound set available, the consortium will seed a massive community target prioritisation and target deconvolution effort. Moreover, in providing chemical tools without restriction, the consortium will also make available tools to invent new assays and unencumbered starting points for probe development or drug discovery. The consortium’s centralised, cell-based and biochemical assay panels will serve as a resource for the entire chemical biology community. The ability to access these capabilities will provide significant incentives for external scientists to contribute innovative compounds to the network, thus expanding the impact with donated resources. The cell and tissue platform with the high-quality, patient-derived cell assays will provide the opportunity for clinical scientists to undertake translational medical research and biomarker discovery, and will provide the roadmap for other clinical centers to access the libraries and make important translatable discoveries.

Scope:
The scope of this action is to generate a small molecule clinical candidate that can boost the activity of ethionamide and revert the existing resistance to this drug, by acting on bacterial transcriptional regulators. The associated, dose dependant side effects for ethionamide observed at the currently required human doses together with the high pre-existing levels of resistance in patients has limited the use of ethionamide as a TB front-line agent. However, ethionamide is considered an essential drug for MDR-TB treatment even today and could well be positioned back into first line, replacing Isoniazid as the ‘fast killing’ agent acting on mycolic acid synthesis, once the bio-activation of ethionamide is optimal. This action aims at identifying novel small molecules that are capable of: a) increasing the level of bioactivation of ethionamide, therefore reducing the levels of ETH required to achieve maximal efficacy both in vitro (>10-fold) and in vivo (>3-fold); b) revert pre-existing ETH clinical resistance using a very low oral dose. This will make it possible to open up the scope of the ETH field of use to both drug sensitive and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) patients. This action intends to progress these new compounds from the candidate selection stage to a proof of concept as ethionamide booster in TB patients.

Scope:
Gepotidacin (GSK2140944) is a novel antibiotic that selectively inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV by a unique mechanism, which is not utilised by any currently approved human therapeutic agent. Structural data with a type II topoisomerase, DNA gyrase, reveals the novel binding mode of the triazaacenaphthylene class and distinguishes it from the binding mode of the quinolone antibacterials. As a consequence of its novel mode of action, gepotidacin is active in vitro against most target pathogens carrying resistance determinants to established antibacterials, including fluoroquinolones. Gepotidacin has broad Gram positive activity and selective Gram negative activity. With increasing antimicrobial resistance, there are fewer options to treat gonorrhoea (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organisation (WHO) urgent need), in particular at the pharyngeal site where tissue penetration is essential to activity and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)/MDR (CDC and WHO serious need) urological infections due to Escherichia coli. In addition, few orally available agents have favourable penetration characteristics which are essential to activity.

A large amount of high-quality health data is collected during clinical studies (interventional and non-interventional), but, beyond the immediate objectives of the study, these valuable data are not used to the extent they merit. Subject to appropriate legal grounds, these data could be used to enrich patients’ healthcare records to improve clinical decision-making and reduce duplication in procedures/investigations. In addition, returning clinical trial data to patients could allow them to contribute their data for additional scientific research (e.g. patient-powered research), in particular for rare diseases where treatments and data are scarce or unavailable. Finally, the lack of transparency and sharing of clinical trial data could contribute to the lack of patient willingness to be involved in studies, delays in clinical study set up and conduct, and delays in conducting health research in Europe to the detriment of vulnerable patients and public interest in general.
Please refer to Call topic text.
Scope:
This project has two main objectives, which are equally important:
The first one is to align local and pan-European implementations and best practice for handling personal data protection regulations in order to foster the harmonisation of the legal framework applicable to medical research in the Member States;
The second one is to deliver a pan-European prototype process to return clinical trial data to study participants, building on previous and ongoing EU-level activities on citizen-centric access to health records. This prototype process will be delivered as part of the project alongside a robust business plan to ensure its sustainability.
To support these objectives, the project will:
Define harmonised rules for complying simultaneously with data protection regulations, regulatory requirements and ethical standards in Europe. These rules are to be endorsed by appropriate regulatory bodies and patients;
Define which, when and how clinical trial data should be returned to study participants, including for integration in, or interconnection with, patients’ individual health records management files or applications and, where they exist, national and/or hospital EHR systems (for clarity, no ‘lay summaries’ or other expert analyses are within the scope of this project) and EHR standards such as EEHRxF;
Define data governance models for cases where individual clinical trial data is (or can be) utilised for both healthcare decision making and future research, taking into account previous and ongoing EU-level activities on data governance in these fields;
Ensure that the whole process, from collection of data to its destruction or anonymisation, including sharing of individual personal data, is aligned with the study participants’ expectations and the authorities and ethics committees’ standards and procedures, and documented in binding and/or approved standards or guidance documents.

Please refer to Call topic text.
Expected Impact:
In their proposals, applicants should describe how the outputs of the project will contribute to the following impacts and include, wherever possible baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact:
For patients: the project results should empower patients by returning their clinical trial data to them and to their medical records. Data acquired during clinical trials will aid better shared medical decision-making and reduce duplication in procedures/investigations;
For healthcare professionals: enriched healthcare data obtained during clinical care should aid better clinical decision making and reduce duplication in patient procedures/investigations;
For EU research: giving patients control of their clinical trial data will open possibilities for ethical data re-use e.g. if the patients opt in to donate their data to a common data sharing platform;
For pharma: returning clinical trial data to study participants during study conduct has the potential to improve adherence to study procedures and improve overall patient retention. Facilitate conduct and setup of clinical studies as well as access to health data for research. Doing this in a meaningful way will further help to educate patients and in doing so empower them to be equal partners in the management of their disease;
For regulators: it is an opportunity to exchange opinions with counterparts from other countries and researchers to propose informed workable aligned positions;
From a societal perspective: the project will increase the transparency of clinical study and therefore increase the trust of patients in clinical research. At a time where clinical trials are increasingly complex, this may help with recruitment for studies and improve oversight by patients and regulators on clinical data re-use.

In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project plans to leverage the public-private partnership model to maximise impact on innovation, research & development; regulatory, clinical and healthcare practices, where relevant. This could include a strategy for engagement with patients, healthcare professional associations, healthcare professionals, regulators, ethics committees, HTA agencies, payers etc., where relevant.

In addition, applicants should describe how the project will impact the competitiveness and growth of companies, including SMEs.

Moreover, in their proposals, applicants should outline how the project will:
Manage research data and adhere to ethics requirements ;
Disseminate, exploit, and sustain the project results. This may involve engaging with suitable biological and medical sciences research infrastructures .
Support the improvement of the interoperability of EHRs by aligning with the EEHRxF.

Vaccines and monoclonal Antibodies (mAb) may reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, individual vaccine developers and manufacturers, as well as organisations developing mAbs and health authorities, acting alone, do not have the resources and the full expertise required to make a realistic and comparable assessment of the use of the different products on the reduction of AMR. This could instead be possible through the development of a mathematical model. For such a model to be representative of the concerns and interests of the various actors (i.e. industry and the public health sector), it should take into account the perspectives of these different actors in order to capture all relevant impacts both in terms of costs and health outcomes.
Please refer to Call topic text.
Scope:
The proposal has the following scope:
1) Evaluate the burden of disease of AMR by estimating inpatients’ (acute care hospitals and long-term care facilities) and outpatients’ infection rates in at least 8 EU countries for which suitable data is collected and available, as well as in the US , and the relative attributable risk for morbidity, mortality and costs.
2) Build a comprehensive AMR model (i.e. model structure, parameters, assumptions) based on an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of existing models, and a gap analysis.
3) Collecting, gathering, and analysing data from existing databases to feed the model.
4) Develop and test a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to estimate the cost and benefits of covering defined target groups (e.g. 18+, 60+, surgeries) with mAbs and vaccines.
5) Set up a study to test, monitor, evaluate and improve the model.
6) Ensure a public and broad access to the model
Please refer to Call topic text.
Expected Impact:
The epidemiological repository that will be obtained by the applicant consortium, besides providing a transparent basis for the BOD estimation, will be made accessible through an internet database to be designed within the project. Any researcher will benefit from using the most comprehensive database on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and resource consumption associated with sensitive and resistant pathogens. Producing a reliable repository with clear description of the methods used to derive the estimates of the BOD and AMR will benefit the credibility of the results of the mathematical model. During the project, the access will be free of charge. The ambition is to favour open access as much as possible.
The results of the mathematical model (publicly available and free of charge) will allow policymakers and healthcare managers to make informed decisions on vaccines and mAb strategies. The impact will include clear direction for EFPIA partners and health care authorities on which research and development strategies should be prioritised to reduce AMR through vaccine and monoclonal antibodies.
Better chance of preserving the efficacy of last-resort antimicrobials. As an example, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has published guidelines for the screening of patients at high risk for Carbapenem Resistant Enerobacteraceae (CRE) and Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) at the time of admission. The retrospective record review will provide an assessment on their status of implementation and will allow estimation of the resources required to put in place a functional screening and surveillance system for CRE and CPE, as well as other types of resistance.
Testing the sustainability of the study approach by financing a multi-year monitoring and evaluation system in key health units of a few pilot countries. The impact will be a strengthening of the existing AMR surveillance systems, and a verification of the assumptions and parameters underlying the model. For example, an initial model focused on a specific vaccine or mAb might provide an initial base which will be fine-tuned according to real data, and which will be further expanded to other promising mAbs and vaccinations, with further fine-tuning.

","Research and Innovation action
","23 June 2020
","17 March 2021","Specific Challenge:
Neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), represent a huge economic and societal burden. One of the key barriers to the development of treatments for neurodegenerative disease is an insufficient toolbox of biomarkers and associated clinical progression data to easily screen populations, diagnose patients, monitor progression and response to treatment, all of which would improve the efficiency of clinical trials. Investments by both funders and pharmaceutical companies have created significant amounts of data and samples that could be used to accelerate biomarker discovery and development in a major way. However, these valuable resources remain in silos, and cannot easily be shared and accessed by the research community. Key unmet needs limiting the use of samples and data for the discovery, development and validation of neurodegenerative disease biomarkers today include:
§ Sample and data access for research use: There is currently insufficient access to high-quality, longitudinal, and well-characterised samples (including clinically well diagnosed and controls) and accompanying clinical data to meet current and future demands.
§ Sample quality: A lack of standardisation in collecting and processing samples and linked datasets causes large disparities in sample quality and decreases the utility of banked samples for researchers.
§ Transparency: There is currently no centralised resource documenting what sample types and accompanying clinical datasets are available across different organisations (public and private), and what access restrictions may be in place.
§ Data sharing: Platforms and processes for sharing clinical data to accompany samples and then to enable reutilisation of derived data are lacking or inadequate in terms of interoperability.
Please refer to Call topic text
Scope:
There are five objectives in the scope of this topic:
Create a set of agreed principles to enable sharing and access to data and samples, taking into consideration all the established legal and ethical research standards and principles (e.g. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), legal, intellectual property (IP), ethical, regulatory, societal issues) and their practical implementation.
Establish a network that can house high quality data and samples, which could have federated and centralised elements. This must build on existing ongoing and relevant cohorts (see objective 4). The overall solution has to be interoperable (e.g. with other global data platforms), scalable and suitable for a broad variety of both data types (including digital), and samples, from public and private (e.g. proprietary clinical trials) sources, whether they be part of the consortium or provided from external donors. Activities related to building a biorepository or data management and sharing platform from scratch are out of scope for this topic. Instead, these must build upon existing resources (including ongoing longitudinal cohorts or studies), knowledge and infrastructures to deliver a novel solution able for seamlessly incorporating existing retrospective samples and data with prospective samples and data collections.
Establish fair and transparent governance and processes specifically to enable sharing and access to data and samples.
Test the above with the defined case studies and apply the learnings to fine-tune processes and use the outcomes to grow the platform. Case studies need to include (but are not limited to) the amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) system (in cohorts with early Alzheimer’s disease) and the complement pathway (in Parkinson’s disease).
This platform must be a self-sustainable entity by the end of the project.
Please refer to Call topic text
Expected Impact:
The self-sustainable network platform composed of a European biobank operation, and accompanying data platform, will positively fuel and impact basic research and development and drug development campaigns in neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD);
The public-private partnership, by providing infrastructure to enable worldwide sample and data sharing will have a substantial impact on the development and regulatory validation of biomarkers/diagnostics, and in turn this would likely have a cascading effect on accelerating therapeutic development.

","23 June 2020
","17 March 2021","Specific Challenge:
Demands of cancer care in Europe continue to increase significantly, with the number of incident cancer cases in Europe projected to increase by 14.1% by 2030. This leads to a growing demand for innovative cancer treatments among patients, payers, physicians, and society. At the same time, the understanding of the complex biology of cancer is growing, and as a result, pharmaceutical companies are developing a multitude of new therapeutic agents.
This trend for new, effective therapies creates more treatment options for patients. However, it confronts physicians with an increasingly expanding number of potential therapeutic options, which each need to be understood and adopted effectively. To become familiar with the huge volume of available information, physicians need to learn continuously about medical guideline changes and marketed treatments. In conclusion, future decision-making processes will become ever-more complex, with the potential outcome of sub-optimal or even incorrect treatment choices being made. Furthermore, some patients have disease characteristics for which evidence of guideline recommendations is scarce and physicians lack information about real-world treatment outcomes. Hence, the challenges to be addressed are assisted guideline-based decision-making and the discovery of knowledge about treatment outcomes in real-world settings. As the latter challenge requires analysis of large data sets, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a key technology.
Please refer to Call topic text.
Scope:
The scope of this call topic is to establish guideline-based decision support and platform solutions to generate knowledge discovery for breast, lung and prostate cancer with applicability to other indications, in several European (EU member states and H2020 associated countries) ‘model’ regions. The funded action will focus only on breast, lung and prostate cancer. These indications show a high number of cases per year, a high, unmet medical need, multiple available therapeutic options and a fast-evolving treatment environment. Expansion to other indications is not part of the funded action but a proposed solution should allow for expansion afterwards. The three core objectives of this call topic are as follows:
Objective 1: Establish a guideline-based decision support for prioritised indications
Objective 2: Establish a structured and interoperable data platform to unlock real-world-data potential in an oncology network
Objective 3: Leverage the real-world-data gathered by the action to establish an AI-knowledge base and support treatment decisions for prioritized indications.
Please refer to Call topic text.
Expected Impact:
In their proposals, applicants should describe how the outputs of the project will contribute to the following impacts and include wherever possible baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact.
An explainable AI-based knowledge discovery platform should enable the development of data-driven solutions with the goal to sustainably improve oncologic treatments throughout the EU and beyond;
The results obtained from these model regions are expected to be of relevance to countries with different socioeconomic backgrounds;
The platform should allow oncologists to save valuable time due to the automatic data gathering and facilitated guideline-based assessment;
In addition, physician-patient communication and shared decision making should be supported which might improve proactive therapy involvement to accomplish increases in individual quality of life as well as overall patient satisfaction;
The platform may also allow research questions from various stakeholders to be answered through data analysis and data pooling as well as data extraction. Besides overall survival, this could include real-world quality of life (QoL) and safety evaluations of new therapies as well as novel combinations under real world conditions. This can potentially contribute to value-based healthcare assessments at EU level;
The solutions provided by a public-private consortium will significantly benefit European society: patients receive optimal personalised treatment; physicians are supported in complex decision-making processes; and payers as well as pharmaceutical companies receive information about real world treatment outcomes as a foundation for value-based healthcare approaches;
The topic is well aligned with the EU Commission’s strategy to develop a European Health Data Space and Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan.

","Research and Innovation action
","23 June 2020
","17 March 2021","Specific Challenge:
Approximately 5,000-8,000 distinct rare diseases (RD) affect 6-8% of the EU population i.e. between 27 and 36 million people; 263-446 million people are affected globall. Despite scientific advances, in Europe, the fact remains that fewer than 10% of RD patients receive treatment and only 1% are managed using an approved treatment. Delivering effective treatments to RD patients where the prevalence is low has been described as one of the major global health challenges of the 21st century. One of the main challenges for RDs is related to diagnosis because RDs are characterised by a broad diversity of syndromic disorders and symptoms that vary from disease to disease and from patient to patient suffering from the same disease. In isolation, these symptoms can be very common, leading to misdiagnosis. Altogether, this leads to a lengthy and burdensome path to diagnosis that can take, on average, take eight years[1], often involving pointless treatments, creating a heavy human and societal burden that could be avoided by earlier diagnosis.
Please refer to Call topic text.
Scope:
The overall objective of this call topic is to shorten the path to RD diagnosis by using newborn / paediatric (infants during their first weeks of life) genetic screening; and, via application of advanced digital technologies that enable rare disease diagnosis / identification. The latter might require consolidation of existing fragmented efforts.
The specific objectives are:
Assessment and development of a comprehensive, strategic overview of existing converging RD resources e.g. databases, registries (such as the EU RD platform), natural history projects, platforms, reference networks, rare disease academic centers of excellence (e.g. European Reference Networks (ERNs)), and initiatives for evaluation / identification of potential collaboration and synergies;
Federation of available RD databases into a RD metadata repository amenable to machine learning or other advanced digital tools;
Co-creating a sustainable strategy for newborn genetic screening and pilot it. This could start directly after achieving objective 1;
Based on the output of objectives 1 & 2:
a) Repurposing of pre-existing diagnosis AI algorithm to identify early onset RD patients in electronic health records (EHRs). This will include at least 3 pilots in better-known rare diseases (with the understanding that solutions and algorithms developed or adapted should be amenable or made amenable to be emulated for larger sets of better-known RDs) where more robust data is available to train and test the AI algorithm(s), and / or;
b) Design and development of new AI algorithm(s) to achieve the above goal.
Based on insights generated by objectives 1, 2 & 4, either repurposing or development of a broad AI RD diagnosis “symptom checker” to help undiagnosed RD patients going from one health care provider (HCP) to another. In addition, exploration of further viable options to implement the symptom checker in actionable solutions for HCPs and patients.

Please refer to Call topic text.
Expected Impact:
In their proposals, applicants should describe how the outputs of the project will contribute to the following impacts and include, wherever possible, baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact.
The Rare Disease conundrum:
Despite the recent rise in RD research and development, most RDs remain under-studied, and therefore under-treated / cared for. This can be attributed for the most part to:
Patients are not identified / diagnosed;
Lack of epidemiological data;
No natural history of disease data;
No validated endpoint / patient-reported-outcomes (PROs);
Patient are rare, experts are even rarer.
This has the pernicious additional effect of blunting interest in diagnosis / screening initiatives, as it would lead to patients being diagnosed with no concrete medical or clinical option. This poses an ethical challenge, which unfortunately feeds the conundrum. This has been identified as a major problem for the rare disease community.
This Call topic anticipates the following benefits:
For patients:
Decreased time to the right diagnosis;
Improved patient journey;
Better healthcare;
Increased quality of life;
Decreased irreversible organ damage;
Access to their own healthcare data.
For healthcare:
Implementation of digital transformation in healthcare;
Paradigm change in rare disease diagnosis;
Improved diagnostic tools;
Improved understanding of disease;
Higher accuracy in clinical decisions;
Better care delivery;
Integrated care among different specialties.
For research:
Advances in utilisation of digital technologies;
Increased disease knowledge for future research;
Improved data availability for future research.
For society:
Decreased burden for family and carers;
Increased trust in the healthcare system;
Better use of data for public health;
Improved value-based healthcare.
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project plans to leverage the public-private partnership model to maximise impact on innovation, research & development; regulatory, clinical and healthcare practices, as relevant. This could include a strategy for engagement with patients, healthcare professional associations, healthcare providers, regulators, health technology assessment (HTA) agencies, payers etc., where relevant.
In addition, applicants should describe how the project will impact the competitiveness and growth of companies including SMEs.
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project will:
Manage research data including use of data standards and, to the extend relevant, the data standards developed by the European Joint Programme on Rare diseases (EJP RD) and the EU RD platform193 for research and registries data respectively, as well as the use of EUPID;
Disseminate, exploit, and sustain the project results. This may involve engaging with suitable biological and medical sciences research infrastructures;
Communicate the project activities to relevant target audiences.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
While the overall management and operation of the activities of the EOSC Portal is addressed in INFRAEOSC-03-2020, the challenge in this topic is to effectively coordinate at pan-European level the provision through the EOSC Portal of state-of-the-art research enabling services from a wide range of national, regional and institutional public infrastructures in Europe, covering diverse thematic domains, and further non-research resources in order to: 1) scale up the EOSC Portal; and 2) set-up a model for interaction between service providers and the EOSC Portal operators through pan-European e-infrastructure entities, based on transparency and effectiveness of cost compensation.
Scope:
In order to coordinate the provision through the EOSC Portal of state-of-the-art research purely enabling services across Europe, proposals should build on the competences of pan-European e-Infrastructures of diverse domains to ensure multidisciplinary research and synergies with national and regional programmes. The progressive federation of the services and resources under the awarded proposals, together with the progressive connection of ESFRI research infrastructures[1] and thematic clouds developed under other parts of the Horizon 2020 programme, should allow the EOSC Portal to provide a catalogue that increasingly meets the researchers’ needs covering the full research life cycle.
All the grants awarded under this topic will be implemented in the same period so that they can work on potential synergies, and coordinate in the overall service offering as well as in the communication and dissemination activities to avoid overlaps and fragmentation. To this extent, proposals should foresee dedicated activities for cooperation with the other selected projects and earmark appropriate resources.
Proposals should clearly identify one and only one of the following areas:
(a1) Distributed and cloud computing resources enabling researchers and other users to process and analyse data in a distributed computing environment. The services should include, but not be limited to, running virtual machines on demand with complete control over computing services, executing compute and data-intensive workloads, analysing large datasets and executing parallel computing tasks, utilizing large amount of processing capacity over long periods of time, sharing resources and enabling collaborative research.
(a2) Data services providing cost-effective and interoperable solutions for data management and long-term curation and preservation. The needs for discoverability, accessibility, interoperability, text and data mining, transfer of data between data resources and computational facilities, storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records), reusability, annotation and integrity across disciplines should be accommodated in multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral contexts. All these services should be aligned with the EOSC rules, considering also ethical and regulatory requirements for sensitive data.
(a3) Services supporting scholarly communication and open access: based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic repositories, aggregators, etc.), the services should empower researchers and research communities and initiatives with the necessary tools and functionalities for systematic publishing, analysing and re-using of scientific results beyond publications (data, software and other artefacts), as well as supporting long-term preservation and curation. The services should also enable scientific workflows with adequate metrics and monitoring mechanisms supporting career development and the monitoring of funding and research impact. Support to a catch-all repository for open research should be provided.
(a4) Above the net services are added-value applications and services that enable users to communicate, interact and collaborate effectively in a heterogeneous and distributed federated environment. The scope of the “Above-the-net” services is broad and may range from simple tools to complex collaborative platforms (including real-time communications and media) that empower the work of cross-border virtual teams with different affiliation members. Above-the-net services make use of the underlying connectivity infrastructure and its core building blocks (such as security and AAI[2]).
(a5) Services and resources from non-research public sector data providers (such as Open Data initiatives/EU Open Data Portal and other initiatives under the European Common Data Space): funding should cover the integration of the services and resources so that they are accessible through the EOSC Portal.
(a6) Additional research enabling services that are not covered under any of the areas described in areas a1 to a5 and that do not overlap with existing services accessible through the EOSC Portal. Services should be of a generic value to the whole research community, such as text and data mining or Copernicus services.
Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to the actions awarded under topic INFRAEOSC-03-2020. The main purpose of the collaboration agreements referred to in Article 41.4 of the MGA is to describe the terms and conditions for the provision of services through the EOSC Portal. The proposals have to be flexible in order to take into account all the relevant governance and business models, rules for participation, operational requirements, standards, etc. in accordance with topic INFRAEOSC-03-2020. For the areas from a1 to a4, proposals should be built on the capacity of established pan-European e-Infrastructures to act as interlocutor with the EOSC Portal operators.
Funding should cover, in particular, the costs incurred by service providers when their services are accessed through the EOSC Portal. Service providers in the consortia must be able to determine the cost of a unit of access and to account for the unit of access consumed by users beyond their usual user community. The reimbursement mechanism shall be in line with the provisions of Article 16.2 of the MGA regarding virtual access activities[3] and with the Decision authorising the use of unit costs for the actions involving virtual access[4] under the Research Infrastructures Part of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme. Contributions to the capital investments of the infrastructure is an eligible category of costs solely when declared on the basis of unit costs and only for the portion used to provide virtual access under the awarded grant. For areas a1 to a4, it is expected that a substantial part of the total budget per awarded grant will be dedicated to cover the costs of EOSC users accessing the services.
Only platforms and services based on mature systems and technologies[5] will be supported. An initial phase to reach the maturity needed for the integration to the EOSC Portal may be foreseen. The services have to be persistent and adapt to the emerging needs of the EOSC users and the underlying technologies. They also need to be modular in order to be used with heterogeneous ICT services such as cloud, data management services, data archives, data processing, etc. They should be intuitive to be used by various users with different profiles and digital competence levels. They need to demonstrate added value to the EOSC Portal users and quality/reliability, through the use of certified mechanisms and standards including any accreditation and certification schemes anticipated under EOSC. They should comply with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles and standards produced under well-established initiatives (e.g. RDA). To the extent possible, services should facilitate the re-use of research data for innovation by diverse stakeholders, including the public and commercial sectors.
Grants awarded under this topic will be subject to the following additional dissemination obligations for interoperability: consortia must make active efforts to freely share, in a timely manner and as appropriate, standards, specifications and methodologies from their activities with the other projects awarded under the same topic in order to foster to the maximum extent interoperability between the different services. Applicants must acknowledge and incorporate these obligations in their proposal, outlining the efforts they will make towards this in Annex I.
Grants awarded under this topic are expected to carry out an analysis regarding energy consumption and environmental impact of technologies used in the context of the project. The analysis should include an action plan in order to limit the carbon and energy footprint with a specific reference to key performance indicators and the standard EN 50600-4[6] together with a timeline for implementation of the defined milestones.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to:
- EUR 8 million would allow the challenge in area a1 to be addressed appropriately;
- EUR 7 million would allow the challenge in area a2 to be addressed appropriately;
- EUR 4 million would allow the challenge in area a3 to be addressed appropriately;
- EUR 2 million would allow the challenge in area a4 to be addressed appropriately.
- EUR 1 million would allow the challenge in area a5 to be addressed appropriately.
- EUR 2 million would allow the challenge in area a6 to be addressed appropriately.
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a duration of 30 months would allow the challenge in this topic to be addressed appropriately.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The main objective of this topic is to set up an operational framework for supporting the overall governance of the EOSC, including the coordination between relevant national initiatives.
Subject to the finally agreed content of the EOSC roadmap[1], the governance of the EOSC should rely on the interplay between three components: a body of representatives of the Member States, the Associated Countries and of the Commission that will decide and oversee the EOSC strategy, setting the broad orientations and the funding of the EOSC; an Executive Board constituted of high-level representatives of the stakeholders that will oversee the EOSC implementation, advising on the way forward and implementing the strategic and funding orientations of the Member States and the Commission; and a Stakeholders Forum open to all relevant stakeholders willing to provide input, e.g. on strategy setting or operational implementation.
The operational framework includes 1) setting up a coordination structure supporting the activities of the EOSC Executive Board that will oversee the EOSC implementation; 2) ensuring coordination between relevant national initiatives/data infrastructures/e-Infrastructures and their federation into the EOSC; 3) fostering FAIR data culture and the uptake of good practices in making data FAIR.
This topic aims to support a decisive shift in service provisioning from the current fragmented setting of national and European e-Infrastructures and thematic data infrastructures to a new federated European ecosystem for research data, fully taking into account the global environment; the new model should be underpinned by a business/funding model and a governance which provide organizational and financial sustainability in the long-term, thus offering added value services to science and innovation actors in Europe.
Scope:
The projects funded under this topic should establish clear links among themselves and with all relevant and EOSC related projects funded under previous and current Horizon 2020 Work Programmes, in order to collaborate and address potential synergies, overlaps and gaps in the overall service offering. As such, these projects will constitute a ‘dedicated and mandated effort or instrument to coordinate EOSC-type activities across Member States’, a need highlighted by the EOSC HLEG report[2], as also endorsed in the Competitiveness Council of 30 May 2017.
Proposals will address one of the following sub-topics:
(a) Setup of an EOSC coordination structure - Coordination and Support actions
This sub-topic aims to set-up a coordination structure to support the EOSC implementation. It will initially support the EOSC Executive Board that will be set up in 2018[3] to advise the EU on the EOSC implementation and assist with the transition by 2020 to the stable and fully-fledged EOSC Executive Board that will oversee the EOSC implementation. The coordination structure will work in close relation with the EOSC Executive Board to ensure the implementation of the strategic and funding orientations that will be set by the Member States and the European Commission, taking into account the views expressed by the EOSC community of stakeholders through the EOSC Stakeholders Forum.
The EOSC coordination structure should therefore be the vehicle that funnels the outcomes of all activities encompassed by this call, and other actions and initiatives on cloud for science and research, into a single operational cloud-based service environment enabling open science, excellent research and knowledge production. For this, the proposals will build on the results of previous Horizon 2020 projects, on the outcomes of the High Level Expert Group on the EOSC and of the Open Science Policy Platform, helping coordinate all EOSC-relevant activities funded under Horizon 2020 and beyond. In particular, the proposal will liaise with the project resulting from Call INFRAEDI-03-2018 as regards collaboration on areas of common interest with HPC stakeholders, taking into account the different level of maturity and pace of advancement of the two initiatives.
The EOSC coordination structure will notably (a) support decision making processes regarding EOSC core functions – e.g. standard setting and certification for metadata, specifications for making data FAIR, certifications for data service providers; identification of services needed by scientists to find, store, share and process research data; provision of core common services, ensuring affordable and sustainable access to data analytics and computation to all researchers; identifying priorities at EU level for new/upgraded research data infrastructures and services; (b) support the development of innovative business models for the delivery of these EOSC core functions; (c) help set the rules and methods of participation through which user communities, research infrastructures, e-Infrastructures providers can co-develop and implement cloud based solutions and services accessible to end users through the EOSC hub (e.g. including 'long-tail of science', PhD students at European Universities, Horizon 2020 individual grantees), including the terms and conditions for contributing to and benefitting from these data services; (d) help structure the EOSC community of stakeholders, e.g. by convening the EOSC Stakeholders Forum annually, by building on the outcomes of the June 2017 EOSC Summit and by supporting and integrating activities carried out today by the EOSCpilot Governance Forum and other relevant fora; (e) help ensure liaise with non-EU countries in policy and technical developments compatible with EOSC, and support multilateral and global initiatives on FAIR research data and clouds.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(b) Coordination of EOSC-relevant national initiatives across Europe and support to prospective EOSC service providers - Research and Innovation Actions
This sub-topic aims to support the coordination, convergence and federation of EOSC-relevant national and/or thematic initiatives for open research data and services through the development of appropriate common tools and mechanisms. The aim is, on the one hand, to support the gradual alignment of policies and practices of EOSC-relevant national and/or thematic initiatives to EOSC standards and, on the other hand, to enable EOSC-relevant, non-commercial services to be accessed through the EOSC portal.
Only EOSC-relevant initiatives and services of wide European interest and at appropriate maturity level, and which are not addressed by other topics under this call, should be considered. The successful proposals will also be called to interact closely among themselves and with the EOSC coordination structure (see sub-topic a). Proposals will exploit synergies with grants resulting from other topics of this call and will build on and complement related work on the EOSC hub undertaken by projects resulting from EINFRA-12-2017 topic, to facilitate the development and adoption of common rules and best practices for harmonising the delivery and take-up of the EOSC core functions, supporting interoperability with other EOSC services, and enabling cost efficiency. Building on the activities supported by sub-topic (c), successful proposals should enable the mainstreaming of standards for data management and of certification schemes for data repositories, and all relevant supporting activities (e.g. technical, organisational and legal training and capacity building); it should also develop and promote incentives for the uptake of FAIR data practices across national scientific communities.
The successful proposals will contribute to the mapping and harmonisation of the procedures regulating the delivery of horizontal services related to research data by prospective EOSC service providers and by national initiatives located in different Member States and Associated Countries, including in areas such as Service Level Agreements, seamless access policies, alignment of procurement practices, user support, certification and compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation and with EU Directive on security of network and information systems. Evolution, training and adoption of standards for federated services and interoperability at all levels, as indicated in the European Interoperability Framework, should also be addressed. Proposals should involve real user communities and research infrastructures in the testing and fine-tuning of the solutions proposed.
Close collaboration with projects resulting from ICT-21-2019 calls is also recommended.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 6 million, would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. The requested contribution should however directly related to the number of prospective EOSC providers and/or EOSC-relevant national initiatives the proposal aims to connect to the EOSC[4].
(c) FAIR data uptake and compliance in all scientific communities - Coordination and Support actions
This sub-topic aims to develop and support the implementation of a common scheme to ensure data development, wide uptake of and compliance with FAIR data principles and practices by national and European research data providers and repositories through the EOSC. As this scheme should constitute a key tool for ensuring effective EOSC governance, the successful proposals will be called to interact closely with the EOSC coordination structure to be established through sub-topic (a).
Proposals should:
facilitate coordination of initiatives, across Member States and Associated Countries or global initiatives (e.g. GO-FAIR initiative, CODATA, RDA, WDS), to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable.
develop and implement measures on FAIR data policy addressing, among others, data stewardship and curation and the creation and interconnection of metadata catalogues.
support the organisation and participation to European and international activities (e.g. via RDA) on FAIR data uptake and compliance.
support the co-development and implementation of standards for data management and of certification schemes for data repositories, and all relevant supporting activities (e.g. technical, organisational and legal training and capacity building).
organise FAIR competence centres for different thematic areas and disciplines not supported by other initiatives.
address the establishment of a European data science competence framework for inclusion in academic curricula, by building on outcome of current and past projects (e.g. EDISON). This framework should include a complementary Data Science professional certification programme for professionals willing to acquire additional competencies.
The successful proposals will be called to interact closely between them, with successful projects resulting from INFRAEOSC-04-2018 topic and with the EOSC coordination structure, particularly to foster adoption of FAIR data practices and in the context of international collaboration.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Pursue, under sub-topic (a), the identification and setup of an appropriate legal vehicle to enable the EOSC core functions (taking into account work done by the EOSCpilot project), the definition of statute and role of a EOSC coordination structure for the EOSC implementation, the rules of participation and decision making, and the governance mechanisms.
Providing a recognized governance and implementation framework to identify priorities at EU level for new or upgraded research data services, thus avoiding proliferation of isolated, separated and overlapping initiatives.
Streamlining advice to policy making and funding authorities concerning the EOSC, including preparation of financial plans and regular update of the EOSC roadmap initially developed by the European Commission.
Achievement of a sustainable support to the EOSC governance via the coordination structure enabling the networking, harmonisation and federation of EOSC related initiatives with capacity of delivering the EOSC core functions to a wide range of users across Europe.
Piloting and establishing future (co)funding strategies and business/usage models to ensure long-term sustainability.
Wide adoption of processes and practices for optimal use of the resources ensuring open, fair and unbiased access of services through the EOSC hub.
Progressive removal of technical and organisational barriers to ensure findability, accessibility, interoperability and re-use of research data.
Enhancement of FAIR data uptake and contribute to harmonisation of related policies in Europe and facilitate alignment with international initiatives on research data sharing.

The aim of this topic is to facilitate wide, user-friendly and cross-disciplinary access to the data and services of the EOSC through the development of the necessary interfaces. The EOSC aims to offer a trusted and open environment for research users of all scientific disciplines across the whole lifecycle of scientific data. This requires concrete solutions to address the current fragmentation of entry points, to avoid duplication of efforts across thematic initiatives and from different scientific disciplines (e.g. multiple portals, web-platforms, websites, etc.). The consolidation of the EOSC hub as the point of access for researchers to help and guide them in finding easily the resources they need, is also crucial for the effective delivery of the EOSC services.
Scope:
(a) Support to the EOSC Portal
This sub-topic aims to provide a fully functional, sustainable and comprehensive user interface that can serve as a universal entry point to the EOSC services.
The proposals will build on the work produced by the eInfraCentral project and provide additional support for the implementation of the EOSC hub to further develop and optimise the functions and interface offered via the EOSC portal. In particular, the successful proposal should incorporate existing scientific gateways and thematic portals developed under FP7 and Horizon 2020 across all work programmes. As the scope of this activity is to provide a single user interface to the EOSC services, at most one proposal is expected to be funded in this area.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Establish the EOSC as the open-to-all, cross-border and cross-discipline access point for data driven science involving the whole European Scientific Community including the “long-tail” of science.
Expanding the relevance of the EOSC as enabler of excellent science and multiplier of impact across disciplines to tackle current and emerging societal challenges

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research infrastructures, as providers of advanced services and as procurers of leading-edge technologies, have an innovation potential that has not always been sufficiently exploited. Opportunities provided by the development of components, instruments, services and knowledge for the implementation and upgrade of research infrastructures, could be better exploited to push the limits of existing technologies. There is a clear innovation potential associated with procurement from industry during the construction and upgrade of research infrastructures.
A co-innovation approach to continuously generate, scale and deploy breakthrough technologies with market and social value needs to be adopted by research infrastructures.
Scope:
The aim is the establishment of an open initiative oriented towards a novel research and innovation collaborative framework engaging both the research communities in Europe using Research Infrastructures and the industry (including SMEs), for the mutual benefit of these stakeholders and the European society at large.
Under the previous Work Programme, through a pilot action, support has been provided to a wide number of proofs of concept demonstrating the potential for industrial application and exploitation of innovative solutions based on research infrastructure technologies. Proposals under this topic should focus on the most promising outcomes of the past pilot action[1] as well as on other valuable opportunities of exploitation of research infrastructure technologies for industrial applications, to further support their development and substantially raise their TRL. These opportunities should have breakthrough potential across Europe, be feasible and scalable, as well as exploitable for industrial applications having societal value.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. Being the financial support to third parties the primary aim of the action, at least 80% of the EU contribution should be used to this scope. Due to the nature of the work to be supported and taking into account that the support for the proofs of concept was already in the order of EUR 100 000 each, the contribution to a third party will go beyond EUR 60 000. The selection of the third parties to be supported under the grant will be based on an external independent peer review of their proposed work.
The calls to be launched within the grant for the selection of third parties should respect the rules and conditions laid out in Annex K of the Work Programme, in particular as regard transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality.
While the past pilot action mainly addressed the industrial applications of detection and imaging technologies in the fields of medicine, manufacturing industry, aerospace, ICT, engineering, environmental sciences, proposals under this topic can also encompass different research infrastructure technologies.
Particular attention should be given to impact, dissemination strategy and the appropriate management of the IPR of the involved research infrastructures as well as to the cost efficiency and transparency of project administration. Proposals should enable the best conditions for the full exploitation by industrial partners of the innovation potential of research infrastructures and support technology and innovation transfer and joint development of high-tech products
Proposals should include clear indicators to monitor and assess the progress towards the action objectives.
Grants awarded under this topic should cooperate with the actions awarded under topic INFRAINNOV-04-2020 to identify and better exploit related synergies and to avoid overlaps. To this extent, proposals should foresee a dedicated task or work package and earmark appropriate resources. Cooperation with the projects funded under topic INFRAINNOV-02-2019 is also encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 35 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This activity will:
establish a co-innovation platform to transparently promote the use of research infrastructure technologies for industrial applications across Europe

","28 November 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Pan-European Research Infrastructures use more and more sophisticated technologies not available on the market, which require ad-hoc developments and often the use of large-scale platforms combining R&D (Research and Development), integration and validation. These platforms can also provide longer-term visibility and involvement of European industry in scientific and technological advancements and therefore ensure greater socio-economic impact.
Scope:
Funding will be provided to research infrastructure networks to kick-start the implementation of a common strategy/roadmap for technological developments required for improving their services through partnership with industry. Proposals should then involve research infrastructures, industry and SMEs to promote innovation and knowledge sharing through co-creation of needed technical solutions and make use, when appropriate, of large-scale platforms combining R&D (Research and Development), integration and validation for the technological developments.
Proposals should address:
if not already done,the identification of key techniques and trends which are crucial for future construction and upgrade of the involved Research Infrastructures and the definition of roadmaps and/or strategic agendas for their development, in close partnership with the industrial partners, especially with innovative SMEs;
the development of the identified fundamental technologies or techniques underpinning and arising from the efficient and joint use of the involved research infrastructures, taking into due account resource efficiency and environmental (including climate-related) impacts.
the prototyping of higher performance methodologies, protocols, and instrumentation, including the testing of components, subsystems, materials, and dedicated software, needed to upgrade the involved research infrastructures, construct their next generation, or develop new advanced applications.
As the grant will not cover the full implementation of the common strategy/roadmap for technological developments, proposals should define a sustainability plan for its further implementation. Proposals should contribute to fostering the potential for innovation of research infrastructures by reinforcing the partnership with industry, through e.g. transfer of knowledge and other dissemination activities, activities to promote the use of research infrastructures by industrial researchers, involvement of industrial associations in consortia or in advisory bodies.
Proposals may include PCP subcontracting activities as described in part E of the General Annexes of the Work Programme.
In order to exploit synergies, share results and avoid overlaps, grants awarded under this topic will be complementary between them. The respective options for complementary grants of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement (MGA) will be applied. In addition, grants awarded under this topic should cooperate with the actions awarded under topic INFRAINNOV-03-2020 to identify and better exploit related synergies and to avoid overlaps. To this extent, proposals should foresee a dedicated task or work package and earmark appropriate resources. Proposals should also build on results from past/ongoing projects, such as AMICI, or the one funded under topic INFRAINNOV-02-2019.
This topic targets 'Advanced Communities' which have reached a high level of integration and can focus on joint research developments. On the basis of a multiannual plan drafted taking also into account the assessment and the timing of previous grants, this work programme invites proposals addressing the following three domains:
Innovation in light source technologies
Innovation in detector technologies for accelerators
Innovation in accelerator technologies
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This activity will:
Enhance the scientific competitiveness of European Research Infrastructures in the long-term and the further development of innovative companies;
Facilitate the creation of both large and viable markets and structuring industrial partners in a critical mass to enable European industry to respond to demands from international Research Infrastructures;
Support the integration of research infrastructures into local, regional and global innovation systems.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
High-quality, accessible research infrastructures are at the heart of the knowledge triangle of research, education and innovation. They enable tens of thousands of researchers in academia and industry to develop innovative ideas, products and services that foster European competitiveness and help tackle societal challenges facing our continent. However, ensuring the availability of state-of-the-art facilities requires multi-billion Euro long-term investments across the European Research Area. In the context of implementing the ERA Roadmap, the focus of this action is to set the conditions for effective investment and optimise the use of research infrastructures of European interest.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation for research infrastructures is needed with a number of key partners located in third countries/regions seen as strategic both for the development, exploitation and management of world-class research infrastructures and for ensuring the necessary complementarities on the international scene required to address research challenges with a global dimension by optimising the use of the available resources.
Scope:
Proposals will address one of the following sub-topics:
(a) Research and Innovation actions for the 2018 deadline
The objective of this sub-topic is to support the development and installation of a dedicated beam-line in SESAME. The proposal should help strengthening the links to the European network of analytical facilities with particular reference to new synchrotrons currently under development. The consortium will work with the SESAME Scientific Advisory Committee to define the scope of the beam-line more appropriate for the scientific community of reference. It should involve European partner laboratories having similar energy and technical specifications in the design and development of the beam-line components and the related instrumentation. The action will cover the installation of the beam-line and its initial commissioning. The action should also address how SESAME will secure the necessary human and financial resources for the operation of the beam-line.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(b) Coordination and Support actions for 2018 deadline
(b1) ERIC network
The growing number of established and upcoming European Research Infrastructure Consortia[1] (ERICs) will have to address similar issues on different procedural and administrative levels such as for example employment of staff, procurement rules, evaluation procedures, access policy, financial accounting, economic activities etc. A more formal and structural collaboration and coordination between them would allow for a more effective approach and mutual benefit for addressing common hurdles. Actions selected under this sub-topic will:
aim at strengthening coordination and networking reinforcing the informal ERIC network or its successor framework;
support the organisation of specific meetings, targeted thematic workshops focussing on common challenges such as the development of internal procurement rules, harmonised reporting, VAT exemption practices, insurances and pensions policies and training of governance bodies representatives;
support ERICs in preparation, on the basis of best practices;
support common communication and outreach activities and strengthening external representation of ERICs' as a stakeholder in consultations and other policy actions that could affect them.
(b2) International visibility of European research infrastructures
The long-term sustainability consultation process highlighted that there is a need to establish international strategic partnerships with third-countries and also to improve the relationship between European research infrastructures and industry. The purpose of this sub-topic is to improve the international visibility of European research infrastructures and of their service. To attain these objectives, the selected action should:
organise thematic workshops and brokerage events covering the various scientific disciplines. These events would bring together the relevant European and international players (research infrastructures / funding agencies / Ministries) and set the conditions for new collaboration opportunities to be explored. A brokerage based approach and organization of a science market place would be expected;
develop concrete tools which Research Infrastructures could use to improve their communication/outreach strategy;
Proposals should build on the European research infrastructures landscaping analysis performed by ESFRI and published in the 2016 update of the ESFRI Roadmap, and establish links with the ongoing RISCAPE project which is conducting an international landscaping exercise.
The activity will have to put in place measures to facilitate exchange of information at international level (e.g. web-portals).
(b3) Catalogue of research infrastructure services
This sub-topic addresses the development of an on-line dynamic catalogue of relevant research infrastructure services at national and European levels, starting from the ones offered under Horizon 2020 grants. Research infrastructures should be able to apply for registering their services and to update the already registered services. Researchers should be cleverly guided in their quest for the needed infrastructure services. Procedures to review and validate registrations as well as a rating system from users should be foreseen. The catalogue should be complementary and tightly linked to the EOSC catalogue, therefore its focus will be more on physical than digital services. Proposals should address and find solutions for the catalogue long term sustainability.
(b4) Support to ESFRI
Actions selected under this sub-topic will support partnerships between policy makers, funding bodies and the scientific community in the context of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) to foster the priority setting and implementation of pan-European research infrastructures. In particular, the foreseen actions will:
support the development and publishing of the ESFRI Roadmap;
support the implementation of ESFRI activities;
support the ESFRI communication and outreach strategy;
support effective review and monitoring of research infrastructures on the ESFRI Roadmap through appropriate analytical tools;
foster cooperation, exchange of experiences and good practices between the research infrastructures, their managers and stakeholders, as well as the funding bodies and policy makers;
foster the cooperation between ESFRI and e-IRG, as well as between research infrastructures and e-infrastructures, in the area of data management to strengthen the integration of research infrastructure user communities.
The proposal should demonstrate the added-value of the activities proposed, in comparison with the activities and responsibilities of national ESFRI delegations as well as previous EU grants, such as CoPoRi and STR-ESFRI.
(b5) Support to the e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG)
Actions selected under this sub-topic will support the activities of the e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG) aiming to foster the integration of pan-European e-Infrastructures within the European Research Area.
The following activities should be addressed:
- Contribute to the implementation of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and the European Data Infrastructure (EDI):
by fostering the cooperation between European research communities and e-Infrastructures;
by facilitating interoperability leading to integration and consolidation of e-Infrastructures;
by increasing the engagement of user communities in the EOSC and the EDI/EuroHPC;
and by offering an independent view on the implementation of relevant EU policies by collecting and aggregating views from the relevant actors;
- Support cooperation with the ESFRI;
- Promote a change of culture of research communities towards open data, robust data management and data sharing practices;
- Organize outreach events to assist the Commission, Member States and Associated Countries in communication activities on role, mission and implementation of the EDI/EuroHPC and the EOSC.
Proposals should demonstrate the value added of the activities proposed in comparison with the activities of other advisory bodies and previous EU grants. To best enable the realisation of the above activities, the independence of the e-IRG group members is paramount. Therefore, proposals should also demonstrate independence and absence of conflict of interest in the membership of the e-IRG group receiving support.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million for the first four sub-topics and of EUR 0.6 million over a duration of up to 30 months for sub-topic (b5) would allow these activities to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(c) Research and Innovation actions for the 2019 deadline
The purpose of this sub-topic is to support the further structuring of the cooperation with the Russian Federation in the Research Infrastructure domain.
Proposals will have to demonstrate the involvement of relevant entities on both European and Russian side and will cover the following 3 dimensions:
i. Building on the strategic recommendations deriving from the CREMLIN project, support the strengthening of the complementarity between Russian Mega Science initiatives and their European counterparts. Proposals will specifically address:
Joint development and acquisition of specific instrumentation to be used by the European and Russian Infrastructures. This activity will specifically target the NICA and PIK initiatives and their European counterparts.

Joint development of future technologies required for Research Infrastructures' instrumentation;
ii. Contribute to overcoming the barriers that prevent European scientists from accessing Russian Research Infrastructures of European interest. The project will support Russian Facilities in setting-up the appropriate access conditions and cover the travel and subsistence costs that European researchers would sustain in accessing the facilities. In this context, the project will have to also take into account the list of Research Infrastructures open to International collaboration produced by the Russian Federation and the European Charter for Access to research infrastructures.
iii. The proposal will develop a staff exchange programme and thematic courses and workshops (e.g. summer schools), aimed at fostering exchanges of best practices on management practices, access procedures and scientific collaboration between infrastructure Staff and Scientists belonging to both the Russian Federation and European Union.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 25 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
(d) Coordination and support actions for the 2019 deadline
Actions under this sub-topic, in line with the EU-CELAC SOM[2]strategic approach[3], will concretely build on the outputs of the newly established EU-CELAC Research Infrastructure Working Group, and will:
support the identification of priorities for regional and bi-regional cooperation based on the respective strategic road-mapping exercises;
foster the exchange of best practices between the EU and CELAC on issues of common strategic relevance such as regional road-mapping processes, research infrastructure management, RI staff development.
support the identification of a limited number of Research Infrastructures of bi-regional interest on which the project will have to conduct pilot cooperation demonstrators comprising:
The organisation of dedicated workshops and meetings between the EU and CELAC involved communities (research infrastructures, ministries, funding agencies). This can also be supported by bi-regional staff exchange activities, dedicated thematic training programmes (e.g. summer schools);
The development of specific roadmaps for cooperation for each of the pilot thematic dimensions and the initial implementation of identified actions, such as supporting reciprocal access to Research Infrastructures in the two regions by covering travel and subsistence costs;
The regular reporting to the EU-CELAC RI WG on the progress, for which an advisory board should be set up.
Under this sub-topic, legal entities established in Brazil and Mexico are eligible for funding from the Union.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The complexity of research infrastructures and the exploitation of their full potential require adequate skills for their managers, engineers and technicians, as well as users. Research infrastructures are built and operated at the cutting edge of what is technologically feasible, involving a high associated risk that needs to be managed. They may involve a wide consortium of partners for their funding, construction and operation, either because they are distributed research infrastructures, or because certain problems are of a scale that can only be tackled by means of European and international cooperation. This renders their governance and the associated financial and legal issues a complex problem. The skills and expertise specifically needed to effectively construct, operate and use research infrastructures are therefore not widely available.
While the human capital dimension will be embedded under other lines of activity of the research infrastructures work programme, specific actions will be needed to foster coordination across domains and types of infrastructures.
Scope:
The activity will support the training of both female and male staff managing and operating research infrastructures, the exchange of staff and best practices between facilities, and the adequate supply of skilled human resources, including through the development of specific education curricula and courses. A proposal under this topic should build on the past activities and the experience gained in projects such as RAMIRI (Realising and Managing International Research Infrastructures) and RItrain (Research Infrastructures Training Programme and presents a clear evolution. The activities should include the promotion of existing good practises at research infrastructures as well as dissemination and exploitation of successful experiences to a wider set of relevant stakeholders. It should continue engaging with universities and developing specific curricula and courses for pan-European research infrastructures, taking into account their intercultural and interdisciplinary nature as well as their diversity (global, highly distributed, single site etc.). Strategic planning for the sustainability of training and exchange programmes should be addressed, with the involvement of national agencies, ERICs, international organisations, and other relevant stakeholders. An increased use of interactive online training material should be explored. Particular emphasis should be put on the development of data management, exploitation and stewardship skills, in line with the FAIR principles, including the mastering of the data protection legislation features.
Expected Impact:
This activity will improve and professionalise the training of the staff managing and operating research infrastructures of European interest, strengthen the human capital of the involved research infrastructures, stimulating their efficient management and therefore promoting their development and competitiveness at national, European and international level. An improvement of existing specific university curricula as well as a more widespread dissemination in the European university landscape is expected.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Research infrastructures, as providers of advanced services and as procurers of leading-edge technologies, have an innovation potential that has not always been sufficiently exploited in the past. There is a clear innovation potential associated with procurement from industry during the construction of a new research infrastructure. However, enterprises (including SMEs) may not realise that they have the opportunity to benefit from this potential simply due to a lack of awareness. On the other hand, industry may find entry barriers to this sector. Moreover, users from industry typically constitute a very small fraction of a research infrastructure's users, again because they may not be aware of the availability of research infrastructures or of an infrastructure's potential relevance to their own R&D activities. There is therefore a need to stimulate innovation both from within the research infrastructures themselves and in their supplier industry.
Scope: Proposals should address the following areas:
1.        Development of a portal of calls, tenders and future needs and technology transfer opportunities in research infrastructures of pan European interest;
2.        Networking of procurement professionals to encourage exchange of good practices across research infrastructure sectors;
3.        Awareness campaign towards industry (including SMEs) on the potential of research infrastructures for their activities in selected R&D areas;
As a first step a repository with the innovation capabilities, purchasing plans, and industrial linkages of the various research infrastructures should be set up, creating an initial point of contact for interested innovation actors. To facilitate the process, the creation of a registry of research infrastructures innovation capabilities and of topical/sectorial research infrastructure industry forums is envisaged to gather and to consolidate the views from industrial sector actors. This should be complemented by thematic knowledge networks that analyse and highlight specific innovation aspects. The Industrial Liaison Officers (ILO), usually appointed for large research infrastructures, should be involved in these networks.
The Commission expects to fund a single proposal under this heading.
Expected impact:  
Research infrastructure projects (including ESFRI roadmap initiatives) actively participate in the innovation process and fully exploit their innovation potential.  Support provided to industry (including SMEs) in the construction and usage of research infrastructures will lead to enhanced competitiveness of the involved actors. Thereby they will contribute to the technological development and exploitation capacity of the European Research Area. In particular this activity will:
         increase the involvement of industry (including SMEs) in the development of research infrastructures, raising the technological level and competitiveness of European companies;
         raise the awareness of industry (including SMEs) regarding opportunities offered by research infrastructure to improve their products, e.g. as experimental test facilities, innovation hubs, knowledge-based centres;
         support the integration of research infrastructures into local, regional and global innovation systems.
         When applicable, the socio-economic impact of past investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced.

","Coordination and support action
","25 July 2014
","12 August 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: Identifying suitable partners for innovation activities is recognised as a major barrier to SME innovation. Innovation support services are addressing this challenge traditionally by two interventions that are often combined: (a) the provision of networking space for personal meetings either as one-off meeting (‘brokerage events’) or as more stable networks (‘clusters’) often with a limited geographic reach; and (b) the definition of ‘cooperation profiles’ (‘technology offers’, ‘partner search profile’ etc.) that are distributed through networks of intermediaries. To a different degree intermediaries become active in establishing the partnership (‘brokerage’). Social media and other web-based services challenge these existing approaches and ask for their revision.
The British ‘connect’ platform is the first publicly financed innovation platform on the web that creates a protected space for companies to display their competences, interest and skills, to reach out to a large number of peers, to make them personal contacts and to engage them in initial cooperation. Commercial offers like ‘linked in’ or various crowdsourcing platforms offer important elements while not regarding themselves as innovation platforms for SMEs.
However, it becomes evident that only a small number of enterprises using the platform have already the skills to draw full benefits from the opportunities. Most establish contacts on the platform – which effectively eliminates the ‘brokerage function’ that is so far provided by many intermediaries – but are unable to maintain the group of contacts or to draw on their skills in the preparation of innovation projects. In that respect they could benefit from a new generation of support services that assist to create value from online collaboration with a group of contacts and potential partners (“assistance to online collaboration for innovation”) 
So far staff in innovation agencies has hardly skills to assist their clients to establish collaborations on web platforms and no profile of skills has been defined. Commercial offers by crowdsourcing platforms remain effectively unaffordable for SMEs or face difficulties to scale up their offers and reach a critical mass of the community.
Scope: To address the described gaps proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:
develop and test new service designs for ‘assistance to online collaboration for innovation’ for SMEs in diverse sectors;
make such new services accessible for enterprises in sectors that are typically not yet benefitting from innovation support;
         develop and test a qualification profile, curriculum and training courses for staff currently providing brokerage services in established networks or SME agencies.
Service designs and qualification profiles shall be formulated independently from a particular collaboration or social media platform. Tests of services shall be undertaken on platforms that are open and bring together already a critical mass of enterprises and innovation stakeholders. Establishing such platforms will not be supported.
The nature of the topic – online collaboration – suggests that the training modules are established as web-based self- or collaborative learning modules that are supported by case studies in the form of videos. The qualification profiles and training modules shall be published under a creative commons license.
Projects proposing new service designs for ‘assistance to online collaboration for innovation’ should indicate on which platform(s) the new service would be tested and in how far the newly developed service could be scaled-up.
It is intended to support 2-3 projects from the indicative budget.
Expected impact:  
         New services assisting online collaboration for innovation help SMEs to access a broader range of potential innovation partners and mobilise them in a timely manner for concrete projects.
         The qualification profile and training material are made available to SME innovation support agencies interested in enhancing the skills of their staff.
         The efficiency of innovation support service provision - for example but not limited to the services of Enterprise Europe Network – is enhanced.
         Resources in public innovation support are reoriented from information and brokerage functions – which can to a large extend be automated – to higher value added functions like the identification of opportunities and the animation of project development.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Current research on open innovation has not taken into account the extent and creativity of SMEs in designing and implementing open innovation strategies. The lessons learned from open innovation come from large firms and are not readily transferable to the context of SMEs. While open innovation in large firms does not affect its strategic objectives, in the case of SMEs, it alters the strategic orientation of the company and requires a comprehensive overhaul of the firm's strategy. If implemented correctly, the benefits for an SME can be very important, for instance in the fields of technology transfer, capital raising, resource optimisation or networking (Vanhaverbeke et al., 2012). An urgent need exists, therefore, to study how collaboration and/or open innovation is managed and organised in SMEs.
Open innovation can be an important lever for growth for SMEs. It is important to investigate the size-related challenges and the required competencies and put them in an SME context and develop promising practices. Scattered local initiatives supporting open innovation in SMEs exist. Awareness of these initiatives should be expanded and the services supporting them professionalised.
At the same time financial and management reporting need to catch up with the logic of open innovation. For an entrepreneur comprehensive data and performance indicators would allow drawing conclusions whether open innovation is productive and should be continued or suspended.
Scope: This activity will consist of the following elements:
- Collection and analysis of information and data on the application of open innovation in SMEs, taking into account different situations in Member States and in specific market segments. Identification of case-study examples and analysis of how these practices are organised and managed both in high-tech and low-tech industries. Publication and further dissemination of an annual report on the use of open innovation by SMEs in selected economic sectors.
- EU-wide diffusion of success stories of SMEs using open innovation. Open innovation support schemes are currently implemented locally. Their scale and outreach is too small to invest significantly in developing content and guidelines and hence they attract limited attention from the entrepreneurs. This action will promote Europe-wide case-study examples that illustrate how entrepreneurs successfully transformed their business through a network of partners. It will also illustrate how managing such a network will allow SMEs to gain competitive advantage, overcome their size and resource limitations and how open innovation can become key both for creation and appropriating value.
- Development of practical management tools to support and explain the identified case studies. The management modules should focus on (1) Strategy dimension, (2) Entrepreneurship skills, (3) Resource needs, (4) Tools to build trust and control and manage risk in a collaborative partnership. This will provide managers of small companies with hands-on guidelines on how to innovate and set-up innovation networks. The aim should be to raise awareness of open innovation in SMEs by identifying best practice examples that will help the professionalisation of open innovation management Europe-wide. The action should provide recommendations on how open-innovation information provision and training should evolve over time, beyond the scope of the present activity.
- Development and testing of open innovation indicators to support management support tools within an SME. The developed quantitative tools should help management to make decision about the timing when to establish or end partnerships. Companies should be supported not only in partnering, but also in determining when, for how long and in which sequence partners should be drawn into the projects.
The duration of this action will be three years.
Expected impact: 
         Increased collaboration of SMEs with external partners to innovate successfully.
         Open innovation will allow SMEs to sidestep the commoditisation pressure and price competition successfully by developing new and more profitable businesses through networking among innovation partners.
         Professional open innovation management by SMEs.
         Creation of an online platform to disseminate best practice examples in the business community and complementing the cases with training modules highlighting specific open innovation aspects.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Horizon 2020 (H2020) aims to increase the impact of SME participation. In the case of the dedicated SME instrument this will be achieved through a coaching and mentoring service delivered during the company's participation in the instrument. The objective will be to empower SME instrument participants to develop and implement high growth strategies based on successful participation in the dedicated Horizon 2020 instrument. The coaching and mentoring will be provided by a network of appropriately trained and experienced business practitioners. It will be delivered in cooperation with the Enterprise Europe Network which will initiate, broker and monitor the coach-SME relationship as well as provide participating companies with access to the wider Network service offering. 
Scope: The objective of the action is to create the conditions for a comprehensive and consistent delivery of the coaching and mentoring service. In order to support peer-to-peer learning and overcome their regional anchoring, the coaches should have the opportunity to exchange ideas and experience with each other to grow the competencies within the coaching network. This will also ensure consistent service delivery. A central facility should be set-up to gather the experiences and data accumulated through the coaching engagement. It should also act as a single reference pool and knowledge resource to assist the coaches in the service delivery.
The action will consist of:
- Awareness raising regarding the recruitment opportunities for SME instrument coaching towards appropriately qualified individuals,
- Creation of information materials, set-up of dissemination events, creation of on-line training modules for coaches regarding SME support in Horizon 2020 and the implementation of SME instrument in particular,
- Community building, networking, exchange of practical coaching experiences within the Horizon 2020 coaching community, 
- Setting up and animation of a virtual coaching platform to connect the coaches to enable them to share experiences, key learning points from coaching engagements and help identify relevant specialist coaches,
- Organisation of coaching meetings to share best practice examples among coaches, in particular across societal challenge areas and economic sectors where coaching methodologies and challenges faced by the coaches will tend to be similar, 
- Set up a monitoring and benchmarking scheme to ensure consistent coaching service delivery.
- Analysis and monitoring of the outcomes of coaching support in Horizon 2020.
As appropriate, the activities should be provided jointly with business support service providers familiar with cooperating on a regular basis with SMEs active in international funding programs and actively participating in the delivery of the Key Account Management service under the SME instrument.
The action will have a duration of two years. The platform is expected to grow as Horizon 2020 unfolds and the number of participating companies and coaching engagements increases.  Beyond the duration of this specific action the scope of follow-up actions is expected to evolve, based on initial experiences.
Expected impact:  The creation of a dedicated platform will support the delivery of the coaching and mentoring service in Horizon 2020 and will result in:
         Enhancing the commercial potential and impact of SME participation in the dedicated Horizon 2020 instrument by ensuring that the project is aligned with and developed as an integral part of the company's innovation strategy,
         Achieving tangible organizational change and improved results,
         Improving the skill's levels of managers, leaving a legacy such that the SME is better able to overcome the barriers to growth post-Horizon 2020 participation.
The platform will facilitate peer-to-peer learning among the coaching community and will ensure the international dimension for coaching, which will tend to be regionally based.

Specific challenge: Small firms and research organisations face a challenge to adequately manage, diffuse and valorise Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) due to limited knowledge and resources. These challenges can be dealt with at regional and national level by general purpose research and business support. However, cross-border commercial or research activities may require a pan-European approach.
The European IPR Helpdesk should provide support in the management, diffusion and/or valorisation of technologies and other intellectual assets and in bringing technologies to the market, including and specifically to participants of Horizon 2020 and COSME projects.
Scope: This project is currently undergoing an evaluation. The future helpdesk should build on top of previous initiatives and reach better the potential target group, both in quantity and quality. In particular, the services offered by this helpdesk should follow closely the recommendations stemming from a document prepared as a follow-up of the external evaluation of the Helpdesk. This document will be published by the end of December 2013[1].
This would require co-ordination with other IPR support funded by the Commission. The activities of the current helpdesk (www.iprhelpdesk.eu) may serve as a source of inspiration.
It is expected that the future helpdesk builds on top of previous initiatives and reaches better the target group, both in quantity and quality.The helpdesk should be ready to adjust the quantity of advice, training, materials and promotion to the demand and to better reach the target group. In particular, the development should follow the recommendations of the document related to the evaluation of the helpdesk to be published by end 2013.
To reach the target group the helpdesk should develop relationships with various business, innovation or research support organisations.
The services offered by this helpdesk should follow closely the recommendations stemming from a Commission document prepared as a follow-up of the external evaluation of the Helpdesk. These documents will be published latest in December 2013[2].
All intellectual property rights and other intellectual assets’ protection means should be taken into account with special attention paid to recent and new legislative developments.
All intellectual property rights pertinent to the materials, trainings, website and other actions developed by the helpdesk will be owned by the Commission and will be shared with other EU-funded IPR support measures.
The helpdesk should use non-technical language and should follow the target group’s demand for initial IPR services as established e.g. through analysis of helpline requests, or feedback from trainings and from co-operating business services organisations.
Depending on the demand of the target group the activities may be provided in the most demanded EU languages. English versions are essential.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The duration of this action will be 48 months.
Expected impact:
         Improve knowledge and capacity of at least 2,000 SMEs, per year increasing this target by at least 15% every year to access, diffuse, use and manage IPR more efficiently. Out of this group the majority should participate or intend to participate in Horizon 2020 or have done so in earlier Framework Programmes.
         Establish support services and cooperation structures with intermediaries (like the regional consortia of the Enterprise Europe Network and system of National Contact Points for the different parts of Horizon 2020) and other relevant organisations enabling them to provide initial guidance to SMEs.
         Update and complement the set of self-help 20 materials and guides for the target group on IPR in commercial, technology transfer and/or research cross-border activities.

Such enterprises or individuals frequently do not have the knowledge or human resources to effectively use and manage IPR. Such entities would be able to better use their intellectual capital if: 1. they had more knowledge, including basics of IPR, and guidance on how to better use professional legal consultants; 2. the professional consultants were better prepared to deal with SME specific challenges 3. cross-border information about IPR issues would be easily available on the internet and 4. National Intellectual Property Offices (NIPOs) would provide better IPR services to SMEs.

The involvement may consist of including the NIPOs in the consortium as beneficiaries or by allowing the provisions of financial support to NIPOs for joint actions in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. Other forms of effective and measureable involvement of NIPOs are possible, e.g, reimbursement of costs of participation of third parties to the joint events, trainings, etc. or service contracts.
The activities should include the communication and trainings on the business use of the European level rights (Unitary Patent, European Trade mark, Community design), the organisation of exchange of experience between National IP Offices on how to help SMEs or individual inventors and how to offer services to this target group. The initial pilot implementation of new services by NIPOs can be included as well as the update of the analysis of current SME needs for IPR support services. The future beneficiary consortium should take care of the joint website www.innovaccess.eu.
Upgraded or new services and trainings for the target group will be provided by the national IP offices to be implemented either by the NIPOs themselves or by the business support providers. Where needed professional legal attorneys should be trained to tailor their advice and to build IPR strategies matching the needs and resources of SMEs.
As appropriate, the activities should be provided jointly with business support service providers, (e.g. the Enterprise Europe Network, private consultancy) and the different IPR Helpdesks. This measure should also contribute to improve and expand business support service providers’ intellectual asset services in conjunctions with NIPOs.
70% of the provided grant should be spent on joint actions described above directly with the national IP offices using the provisions of financial support or other mechanism that would involve a large number of NIPOs in joint activities. Such joint actions will need to have precisely defined topics, tangible and measureable deliverables at their end, as well as a clear reporting on how they impact on SMEs.
All intellectual property rights to the materials created should be granted free of charge to the Commission and the National IP Offices for further use, re-use and unrestricted modifications. The project leader will co-operate and exchange materials with other Commission services IPR projects: IPR helpdesks and the transatlantic portal.
The project should be operational for a period of 48 months.
Expected impact:
         At least 25 national IP offices in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon 2020 participate actively in the learning and capacity building activities of the project either as beneficiaries in consortium or as beneficiaries of a financial support established by the project.
         Upgrade or create new services and trainings for the target groups according to the needs of SMEs. At least 1 action should be undertaken per year in each country benefitting directly from the action.
         At least 1,000 SMEs are directly or indirectly trained on the business use of European level rights and 2,500 SMEs (average 100 per participating NIPO) are directly or in-directly benefitting from the upgraded or new services and trainings.
Existing IP, like the common website (innovaccess), and new IP generated is effectively managed and is available free of charge to the Commission and the National IP Offices for further use, re-use and unrestricted modifications.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge: Innovation voucher programmes are well established support instruments for SMEs in many countries and regions in Europe. In a general way innovation voucher schemes can be characterised as small, lump-sum grants (typically below EUR 10.000) that support SMEs to contract universities, R&D service providers or private consultants to either conduct small innovation projects or to explore the feasibility of larger ones. In most innovation voucher schemes the innovation agency that has issued the voucher pays the invoice of a service provider after the SME has received the requested service. Innovation vouchers are used to establish an initial contact between knowledge institutions and SMEs and have proven to be a successful instrument to support the spin-in of technology and knowledge into SMEs' business practice. Most innovation voucher schemes are however limited to beneficiaries and service providers from a limited geographic area, which limits the possibility for transnational activities. Furthermore, the diversity of designs of voucher schemes sets barriers to cooperation between schemes. 
In the 'Riga-Declaration'[1] managers of innovation voucher programmes in the Member States have given recommendations for exploiting the full potential of innovation voucher programmes. Amongst other, the potential role of the European level, is described as follows:
 ""5. Innovation vouchers schemes should be implemented at local, regional and national level, thus fully taking into account the subsidiarity principle. The European level is encouraged to develop with national and regional entities a voluntary collaboration and brokerage framework for innovation voucher programmes that aims at making excellent knowledge, skills and innovation support services from both public and private service providers across Europe more effectively accessible for SMEs.""
The proposed action aims at establishing such a voluntary cooperation framework with the objective to achieve among participating schemes an automatic recognition of foreign European service providers at equal conditions to the national ones.
Scope:The proposed activities will assist the development of a European label for innovation voucher programmes that treat foreign European service providers equally to national ones. The systems to manage and award the label might provide services to participating managing entities of innovation voucher programmes which enhance the quality of delivery or manage the higher risks resulting from international opening of the schemes. Financial incentives, for example co-funding a limited number of initial transnational cooperation projects with knowledge institutions, might be provided within the limits set for the provisions of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. 
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting another amount.
Expected impact: 
         The action shall establish a European label for innovation voucher programmes that provides an open cooperation framework for the programmes established at local, regional and national level.
         Participating programmes shall, as a minimum requirement, commit to treat foreign European service providers equal to those domestic ones and aim at a minimum of 5% of innovation vouchers used for cooperation outside the home country.
         Increase the range and quality of services available to SMEs,
         Enhance the opportunities of excellent researchers and other specialists to transfer their knowledge transnationally and accelerate the spin-in of technologies and knowledge.

","14 July 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: Innovation support agencies, i.e. the regional and national agencies that design and/or implement innovation support programmes for SMEs are important intermediaries for SME innovation. Focus, design and delivery mechanism of innovation support programmes determine to a large extent the economic impact from the supported actions and the satisfaction of the beneficiaries with the support provided. The European Union has in different programmes, including for example the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the Competiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and INTERREG, supported mutual policy learning and exchange of ‘good practices’. However, the transfer of good practices in SME innovation support, the enhancement of existing and the establishment of new innovation support programmes for SME remains slow; and SMEs benefitting from support the programmes still often remain dissatisfied with the services received[1].
The PRO-INNO Europe 'INNO-Partnering Forum' (IPF, 2009-2012) has made some significant contributions to formulating the requirements for a permanent learning mechanism for SME innovation support agencies[2]: learning activities have to be based on clear methodologies and they have to be demand driven, launched at the moment agencies themselves recognise the need to revise programme formats. Furthermore peer learning activities need to benefit from a secretariat or an animation structure that assures horizontal flow of information among interested agencies. In a collaborative exercise the IPF has developed two important methodologies in this respect: a quality management system implemented through a peer review system based on the EFQM methodology and a 'twinning+' methodology that combines elements of traditional peer reviews and twinning in small learning groups of interested agencies.
It is the objective of this action to make available to national and regional innovation agencies these two methodologies as elements of a permanent peer learning environment and to give incentives to the agencies to engage more frequently in peer learning activities.
Scope: The proposed activities will provide incentives in the form of small lump sum grants to national and regional innovation agencies for engaging in peer learning on all topics relevant for design and delivery of innovation support programmes for SMEs. The support to joint learning activities shall be available at any time when need and opportunity for policy learning in agencies arises. While peer learning is open for all relevant topics only the 'Twinning+' methodology as well as the quality management scheme for innovation agencies based on EFQM are recognised as learning methods. 
Expected impact:
         The number of innovation agencies engaged in peer learning activities significantly increases. The results of the peer learning are taken up by national and regional innovation support programmes, including those co-financed by European Structural and Investment Funds.
         A broad range of new topics and approaches in innovation support to SMEs is investigated and developed by peer learning activities of national and regional innovation agencies. Pilot agencies design and implement programmes based on these new approaches.
         The wider use of quality management in innovation agencies enhances efficiency of service delivery and customer satisfaction and accelerates the learning process.

Specific Challenge:  The aim is to get the best value out of the Union’s cooperation with its most important international partners and to generate more impact by enhancing and focusing international cooperation activities, by:
−      Stimulating research actors from the Union and its international partners towards increased cooperation, notably through Horizon 2020 and through the partner's funding programmes;
−      Supporting the identification and implementation of targeted international cooperation activities with sufficient scale and scope;
−      Contributing to eliminating remaining obstacles to cooperation between actors from the Union and its international partners;
Scope:  Proposals should support the main objective of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012) 497) to enhance and focus the Union's cooperation activities, by:
−      Supporting the policy dialogue on research and innovation between the Union and the partner in question by identifying areas where targeted international cooperation activities would be of mutual benefit (notably by taking a forward looking approach) and where there is the potential to generate sufficient scale and scope. This should be based on existing objective information and analysis and in particular that provided through previous actions supported through Union funding with the partner in question;
−      Supporting in a flexible manner the implementation of activities agreed within the policy dialogues between the Union and the partner in question, as well as contributing to increasing the coordination and strengthening of the synergies between the activities and programmes of the Member States, the Associated Countries and the international partner in question. Where appropriate, this should include seeking complementarity and coherence with on-going activities of the Strategic Forum for International Cooperation (SFIC);
−      Encouraging cooperation between research and innovation actors from the Union and the partner in question, by promoting the opportunities offered by Horizon 2020 towards the international partner. This should include notably the setting up of web-based information systems, but it can also involve the organisation of awareness raising and information dissemination activities or the organisation of brokerage events, conferences or workshops;
−      Ensuring that progress is made towards establishing appropriate framework conditions for international cooperation between the Union and the partner in question, notably by identifying remaining obstacles for cooperation and by supporting the development of solutions to eliminate these, while jointly promoting measures which facilitate international cooperation (e.g. on open access, scientific visa, IPR, peer review, research integrity etc).;
−      This should be underpinned by an analysis of the cooperation patterns between the Union and the partner in question, notably through Horizon 2020 and previous Framework Programmes. This should also provide information on the type of participants (including their position in the partner's research and innovation system) wishing to engage with European researchers through the Union's funding programmes and their reasons for doing so.
In this work programme, the following international partners are:  Australia, USA, Brazil, Russia, China, South Africa, and also Ukraine.
Proposals should be made by consortia consisting of balanced partnerships between European and international partners, ensuring adequate involvement of public authorities and other stakeholders (e.g. funding agencies, research organisations, industry, civil society) of the participating countries. On the European side, broad involvement across all Member States and Associated Countries is expected, either within the consortium or through appropriate outreach activities by the consortium to other Member States and Associated States. Proposals should build on the results of existing cooperation initiatives, and in particular those funded through the Seventh Framework Programme Capacities part 'Activities of International Cooperation'.
Type of action: Coordination and support actions
A maximum of one proposal will be supported per international partner from the list provided above. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1.95 million per proposal for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately for the proposals targeting USA, China, Brazil and Russia. For the proposals targeting Australia, Ukraine and South Africa, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1 million per proposal for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: In order to strengthen public-public partnerships and support Member States and their research funders in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of jointly implemented actions it is necessary to provide a common framework. The ERA-NET scheme has supported collaboration between Member States (MS) and their research programmes since the beginning of FP6. It has developed into a powerful tool creating joint transnational calls with a total volume of currently 2 billion € and a broad variety of additional activities between programmes that strongly support the realisation of ERA. Since its start in 2008, the joint programming process and the joint programming initiatives have gained considerable momentum and have led to the development of strategic research agendas, visions ahead and first joint activities, which in general have taken the form of common calls. The reinforced ERA Partnership calls on Member States to strategically align their national funding under common strategic research agendas.
What is now needed is moving forward to the implementation of common strategic research agendas, including joint actions with critical mass and alignment of national/regional activities. The specific challenge addressed by this action is how to realise a common approach to the preparation and implementation of joint activities and aligned national/regional activities, their monitoring and impact assessment as well as dissemination of results. This will involve the main stakeholders engaged in designing and deploying the broad structures and functions for the coordination and cooperation of national and regional research programmes.
Scope:  Proposals should cover at least one of the following areas:
- Development and implementation of a user-led 'information, learning and support platform' for Public-public partnerships.
The action will support the information, monitoring and evaluation needs of all users, provide learning materials and functionalities including annual events and ensure the maintenance of a web-based portal with direct and indirect IT services. The action must take into account the experiences gained from current actions (ERA-LEARN, NETWATCH, JPI to co-work). Proposers must demonstrate the ability to respond to user needs of the main stakeholders involved in Public-Public Partnerships (P2P) and ensure a representative participation.
- Optimising modalities and implementation of Public-Public Partnerships
Actions must be user –led and support improved and coherent implementation of P2Ps, e.g. the further development and common application of Framework Conditions for JPIs, the support for the development and implementation of a Joint Programming 'Knowledge Hub' concept for Less Research Intensive countries or other conceptual and methodological approaches.
- New modalities for aligning national/regional activities under common research agendas
The action should assess and benchmark current approaches and support stakeholders to introduce or scale up new approaches that allow Member States and funding bodies to increase competition, excellence, and impact in their national activities (calls for proposals, institutional funding, etc.) that implement commonly agreed research agendas.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The action will contribute to increasing efficiency of public administrations. It will support the implementation of innovative concepts between Members states and funding bodies, and contribute to higher standards in joint programming between Member States. Monitoring and analysis will deepen the understanding of the functioning of P2P and their impact at European, national and regional level. The action will provide further opportunities to share experiences and develop common approaches among the main stakeholders engaged in designing and deploying the broad structures and functions for the coordination and cooperation of national and regional research programmes. Furthermore, the on-line platform will enable better use of research results across borders.

Specific Challenge: The aim of this pilot activity is to promote co-operation between national/regional funding bodies and contribute to increasing the quality of research in Europe.
To this end, national/regional funding bodies will form consortia to launch synchronised calls at European level, addressing a pre-determined scientific field with one identical call deadline and using joint international peer review. This international joint peer review will ideally replace the national/regional evaluation procedure of the national research proposals. The funding decision will ultimately be made by each national/regional research funding body.
Synchronised Calls are intended to:
enhance research excellence by helping Member States to improve their evaluation systems
enhance transparency and fair treatment by providing one comparable pan-European score for proposals at national/regional level based on joint international peer review.
improve the  effectiveness of national research systems by helping Member States to benchmark areas where their researchers perform best and to guide national research and innovation strategies focused on their strengths
increase efficiency of research funding in Europe by highlighting topics in which different researchers are focusing on the same aspect of a research issue (in order to avoid duplication). 
increase visibility of high performing researchers in less research intensive countries by identifying them through the joint international peer review.
For each Synchronised Call, research funding bodies will determine a scientific field in which they publish a call on a synchronised basis in several European countries. There will be a common deadline for proposal submission as well as common evaluation criteria and a common scoring method. There will be a common working language for proposals. A common evaluation panel will be composed of internationally recognised experts.
After the joint international peer-review the participating funding bodies will receive the evaluation summary reports only for their national research proposals. The abstracts and metadata of proposals which are above threshold will be made available across the participating research funding bodies, e.g. to facilitate benchmarking. The actual selection of proposals for funding would ultimately be made by each national funding body: individual funding bodies would not be bound by the evaluation result, but would be encouraged to fund only those proposals which are above threshold. The project proposals may, but are not required to, have a transnational dimension.
Scope: The Synchronised Calls initiative will be open to any thematic area and each consortium will launch one call in a scientific field pre-determined by that consortium.
The consortium of national/regional funding bodies will:
a) Organise a Synchronised Call (planning, documentation, evaluation process, selection of evaluators, call publication, IT systems for proposal submission and evaluation, promotional activities, etc.)
b) Implement the joint international peer review of the Synchronised Call;
c) Provide a detailed report on the outcome of the Synchronised Call and related statistics.
Up to 5 Synchronised Call initiatives will be supported under this action. The expected duration of the project is to 2 years.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.2 million and 0.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Participation in a joint international peer review process will help Member States to improve their evaluation systems. By evaluating research project proposals on a transparent, objective and comparable basis, it will be possible to identify the best researchers in Europe. This in turn will bring the best ideas in a particular field to the forefront and ensure equal and fair treatment.
Synchronised calls based on a joint international peer review allow Member States to benchmark how their research teams perform against their European peers.  Equally, because this approach helps to identify high performing researchers in less research intensive countries, it will increase the visibility of high calibre researchers in those countries. This could also open the way to new research collaboration opportunities for these researchers and, in this way, contribute to achieving the widening objective for research in Europe.
It can facilitate the entry of new research teams to the Framework Programmes and the ERC; researchers who have not participated yet in the Framework Programme could be encouraged to submit research proposals to the Framework Programme building on the positive experience of a joint international peer review through the synchronised call.

","25 November 2015","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Current societal and economic challenges as well as rising expectations to reduce the burden on users, put pressure on all public administrations to provide efficient, open and citizen-centric public services.
Due to the increased use of mobile technology as well as the increasing availability of public information, data and online services, public services can be transformed. Coupling open public data and services with information and services offered by the private sector can lead to innovative, user-friendly and personalised services that can be accessed easily.
Because of their size, knowledge and agility, SMEs are key actors for the provision of those innovative services. The ""apps"" market for mobile devices is a very dynamic market, which mostly lacks application specifically for the public sector. Engaging SMEs into the potentially huge public sector innovation market is a challenge for local and regional public authorities.
The scope of this action is to provide support to innovative SMEs, including start-ups, for the design and creation of innovative applications, in order to foster the delivery of mobile public services.
The aim is to help the interaction of citizens and businesses with public administrations. This may be done through the combination of public and private sector services, through mobile technologies. Although they may be first piloted in a local context – with the involvement of public administrations and end users - the solutions need to ensure replicability, also taking into account multi-lingualism and, where necessary, the cross-border dimension. Scalability and sustainability issues are to be considered.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of business transformation and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annex.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service
will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
         Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
         Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge in a sustainable way.
         Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
         The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

Specific challenge: The aim is to:
−      stimulate and enhance the cooperation between researchers from the Union and those of the regional partners in question, including and in particular through Horizon 2020 and the partner's funding programmes;
−      eliminate remaining obstacles to cooperation between researchers from the Union and its international regional partners
Scope: Proposals should target international partners in a regional context and should cover the following set of activities:
−      Encouraging cooperation between research and innovation actors from the Union and the partner in question, by promoting the opportunities offered by Horizon 2020 towards the international partner. This should include notably the setting up of web-based information systems, but it can also involve the organisation of awareness raising and information dissemination activities or the organisation of brokerage events, conferences or workshops;
−      Ensuring that progress is made towards establishing appropriate framework conditions for international cooperation between the Union and the partner in question, notably by identifying remaining obstacles for cooperation and by supporting the development of solutions to eliminate these, while jointly promoting measures which facilitate international cooperation (e.g. on open access, scientific visa, IPR, peer review, research integrity etc).Where appropriate, this should include seeking continous complementarity and coherence with activities of the Strategic Forum for International Cooperation (SFIC).
 In this work programme the following regional partners[1] will be targetted: Southern Mediterranean Neighbourhood (including activities in support of bilateral S&T Agreements with Algeria, Morocco, Jordan), Eastern Partnership, the Black Sea region, the Middle-East and Africa. For Africa the proposal will also include support for the implementation of activities agreed within the EU-Africa High Level Policy Dialogue, including by increasing the coordination between the activities and programmes from the Member States, the Associated Countries and the African partners.
Proposals should be made by consortia consisting of balanced partnerships between European and international partners, ensuring adequate involvement of public authorities and other stakeholders (e.g. funding agencies, research organisations, industry, civil society) of the participating countries. On the European side, broad involvement across all Member States and Associated Countries is expected, either within the consortium or through appropriate outreach activities by the consortium to other Member States and Associated States. Broad participation from the targeted region is also strongly encouraged. Proposals should build on the results of existing cooperation initiatives, and in particular those funded through the Seventh Framework Programme Capacities part 'Activities of International Cooperation'.
Type of action: Coordination and support actions
A maximum of one proposal will be supported per international partner region from the list provided above. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1.95 million per proposal for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately for the proposals targeting Africa and the Southern Mediterranean Neighbourhood. For the proposals targeting the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea region, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1.5 million per proposal for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. For the proposals targeting the Middle East, the Commission considers that a proposal requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1 million for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact for Topics 1 and 2:
−      More strategic priority setting for cooperation with the Union's international partners across the whole of Horizon 2020;
−      Stronger interaction between the Union's researchers and those of its international partners, including through a stronger participation of the Union's international partners in Horizon 2020;
−      Establishment of optimal framework conditions for international cooperation;
−      Increased coordination and synergies between policies and programmes of the Member States, the Associated Countries and the Union's international partners;
−      Ensuring close synergies with the international dimension of calls launched across Horizon 2020 to enhance the socio-economic impact of Horizon 2020 (notably through increased access to scientific excellence across the world and the opening up of new markets.
[1]     The following non-EU Member States are targeted as part of the named regions (broad participation from            the region is encouraged):
−       Africa: all countries of Africa;
−       Southern Mediterranean Neighbourhood: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunesia;
−       Eastern Partnership: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine;
−       Black Sea: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Russian Federation, Turkey, Ukraine;

Countering Terrorist Financing: new initiatives reinforcing the capacity of public and private actors to track and curb terrorist financing better among Member States. The objectives are:
to make sure that the efforts of private entities and competent authorities are adapted to the new modus operandi of terrorist groups, as for example addressing financial mouvements related to “low cost” terrorism phenomena which are hard to detect.
to reinforce the action of private entities and public authorities to prevent and pursue terrorism financing by increasing the understanding of the phenomenon and by use of best practice and/or new tools. For example:
- development of typologies
- joint work to address new trends in terrorism financing
- enable law enforcement to provide feedback on information provided by the private sector to improve quality of reporting
- sharing police information with private sector entities to assist ongoing investigations

Specific challenge: The bioeconomy encompasses the production of renewable biological resources and the conversion of these resources and waste streams into value added products, such as food, feed, bio-based products and bioenergy[1]. It cuts across many different sectors and research and innovation fields, and has a wide range of socio-economic implications. Addressing comprehensively inter-connected societal challenges related to the bioeconomy requires: 1. Ensuring a responsible and participative governance, by overcoming the current lack of information and public debate on the bioeconomy, while responding to citizens' needs and concerns,  by providing adequate support to new promising markets, and by reconciling conflicting policies and ethical concerns; and  2. Integrating efforts undertaken throughout all steps of the research and innovation chain, to facilitate the flow from discovery to market applications and to speed up the innovation process.
Scope:Proposals should address the following issue (B):
B.    Bridging research and innovation efforts for a sustainable bioeconomy[2]
Proposals should create links among various bioeconomy-related research and innovation activities carried out under different parts of Horizon 2020 and of the Seventh Framework Programme.  This should foster knowledge transfer of best practice in sustainable process and technologies and facilitate the flow from discovery to further research and innovation (e.g. through twinning, networking, exchanges) and help discoveries to reach the market faster.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1–2 million for (B) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals should show how some, or all, of the following impacts will be achieved:
         Engage the public to develop an understanding of the bioeconomy and its consequences and benefits.
         Improve the availability and quality of information on bioeconomy products and processes, including their social, economic and environmental impacts and the related ethical concerns, and foster future-oriented multi-stakeholders dialogues
         Facilitate the development and acceptability of regional and national bioeconomy strategies
         Speed up the pace of innovation, by bridging the gap between discovery and market, through closer ties between activities throughout the research and innovation chain
         Contribute to increasing the number of innovative products and processes reaching the market, and increasing the number of new companies and new jobs created from EU-funded research and innovation projects. Impacts could also be important on standards and policy development.
Type of action: Coordination and support actions
[1] During the negotiation and implementation phases, synergies and complementarities with actions that will be selected under topics BG-11 and ISIB-2 should be ensured.

Specific challenge:Facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs within Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge 2 on ‘Food Security, Sustainable Agriculture, Marine and Maritime Research and the Bioeconomy’ and the Key Enabling Technology (KET) ‘Biotechnology’ with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of this Societal challenge and the KET Biotechnology.
Scope:Support should be given to a consortium of formally nominated NCPs in the areas of Societal Challenge 2 and the KET ‘Biotechnology’. The activities should be tailored according to the nature of the area, and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to Societal Challenge 2 and the KET ‘Biotechnology’ as well as to gender dimension of Research and Innovation, and twinning schemes. Special attention should be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to Societal Challenge 2 and the KET Biotechnology and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under ‘Science with and for Society’.
From EU Member States and Associated Countries, only NCPs who have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, participation of NCPs from third countries is welcome[1].
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and  the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.
A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe and in connection with the rest of the world.

Specific challenge:Following the implementation of the actions foreseen by the Commission’s Communication on Joint Programming to tackle Europe’s major societal challenges, the Competitiveness Council has welcomed the progress made by EU Member States in Joint Programming Initiatives launched so far and especially in the Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change Joint Programming Initiative (FACCE JPI) tackling the combined challenges of food security against the continuous threats from climate change, global population increase, and food and non-food demand. Several Council Conclusions on Joint Programming[1] invite the Commission to support JPIs via Coordination and Support Actions.
Scope: Proposals should build on the results expected by the coordination action in support to the FACCE JPI in the implementation of the Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) and Implementation Plan using effective and efficient methods of collaboration such as those proposed by the 'Voluntary guidelines on Framework Conditions, adopted by the High Level Group on Joint Programming. To carry out activities foreseen in the Implementation Plan, current efforts should be assessed to provide information on Member State implication and to favour the alignment of these activities to the JPI's SRA. Moreover, proposals should support in harmonization, integration, and alignment of national research programming, to enable evidence-based policy making and effective cross-policy actions, investigate novel forms of implementation of SRA such as synchronised calls. Finally, they should further strengthen the international dimension of the JPI to be addressed by ensuring coherence with other relevant international initiatives. In line with the objectives of the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, proposals are encouraged to consider cooperation with related programmes from third countries[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: In coordination with the SCAR Committee and relevant Bioeconomy ERA-NETs, proposals are expected to:
         promote the uptake of the FACCE SRA in national programmes and activities in order to reduce overlaps
         ensure coordination with Horizon 2020 objectives, with a scale and scope of action that should go well beyond what either the EU or Member States can achieve on their own.

The future design of the Internet of Things applications will depend crucially on the development of sophisticated platform architectures for smart objects, embedded intelligence, and smart networks. Most of the today's IoT systems are however mainly focused on sensors, whereas in the future actuation and smart behaviour will be the key points.
Research driven by ambitious use cases and benefiting from innovation areas in components, systems, networking and web technologies needs to be carried out to respond to the ever increasing needs of future IoT systems in terms of scalability, heterogeneity, complexity and dynamicity. IoT platforms should be open and easy-to-use to support third party innovation
Scope:
Architectures, concepts, methods and tools for open IoT platforms integrating evolving sensing, actuating, energy harvesting, networking and interface technologies. Platforms should provide connectivity and intelligence, actuation and control features, linkage to modular and ad-hoc cloud services, Data analytics and open APIs as well as semantic interoperability across use cases and conflict resolution. The work may also address the emergence of an open Web of Things like environment with search capabilities, so that ""thing events"" can be published, consumed, aggregated, filtered, re-published and searched for. Platforms should be compatible with existing international developments addressing object identity management, discovery services, virtualisation of objects, devices and infrastructures and trusted IoT approaches. Proposed research and innovation should take advantage of previous work and build on existing platforms, such as FIWARE, CRYSTAL or SOFIA, if appropriate.
IoT security and privacy. Advanced concepts for end-to-end security in highly distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic IoT environments. Approaches must be holistic and include identification and authentication, data protection and prevention against cyber-attacks at the device and system levels. They should address relevant security and privacy elements such as confidentiality, user data awareness and control, integrity, resilience and authorisation.
Proposals should address above mentioned topics, verification and testing, and identify the added value of the proposed approach specific to IoT in comparison to generic solutions. They are expected to include two or more usage scenarios to demonstrate the practicality of the approach.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Two or more of the following criteria should be addressed, with success metrics where appropriate.
Evolution of platform technologies and contribution to scientific progress enabling novel, advanced semi-autonomous IoT applications.
Strengthen the industrial EU technological offer of innovative IoT solutions
Contribution to emerging or future standards and pre-normative activities
Increase of IoT usability and user acceptance, notably through strengthened security and user control
Support emergence of an open market of services and innovative businesses

It is demonstrated that simulation of an additive manufactured engine part concerning residual stresses and distortions is possible. However the usually used models incorporate many simplifications and can therefore not model the complexity of real life parts and the AM-process.
Results indicate that simulation of a number of equal or geometrically complex or big parts with supporting structures on the building platform may need several 100 hours of simulation time which is not applicable in terms of process optimization. The aim of this project is therefore to increase the fidelity of the predictions and decrease the calculation time dramatically by novel methods.

A conceptual design is required, based on a typical aircraft specification of a high-speed (285 KTAS)/high altitude (25000ft), pressurized configuration. The design should be compliant with FAR23 / CS23 regulation, range and payload may be optimized. The expected project outcome would include sizing and layout of system components, including fault tolerance scenarios, and quantified environmental targets, including a full LCA analysis of the proposed concepts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Mitigating aviation’s contribution to climate change through its various emissions (including but not limited to CO2) will require new and increasingly more disruptive technologies. A reduced global warming impact could be achieved by relaxing the design constraints typically set, such as (but not limited to) aircraft design payload/range, cruise speed and cruise altitude. This topic asks for a multi-disciplinary optimization based on various cost functions such as operating cost, CO2, NOx, soot/particulate matter, as well as the likelihood of contrail induced cirrus formation as a function of the aircraft/engine design parameters (payload, range, cruise Mach number and altitude, etc.). An estimation of the mitigation potential by deviating from current typical operational parameters and current aircraft is expected. For a given design, an estimate of the sensitivity to operating parameters such as speed and altitude should be given. Selected projects should allow the coverage of two key air transport market segments: the passenger long-haul market segment as well as the short to medium range segment. Proposers should select design payload/range metrics that correspond with typical aircraft utilization for instance selecting route coverage up to a representative percentile of existing traffic flows. Proposers are free to select one, or both market segments and to define a relevant reference aircraft; and subsequently to present aircraft concepts that provide climate optimised performance. The CS2 Technology Evaluator can provide a validation opportunity within the CS2 environmental assessment. Please refer to the full topic descriptions document published in this call."

The most “easy” way to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and performance of an aircraft is to increase its aspect ratio of its wings. Increasing the aspect ratio has a direct effect on the induced drag. Increasing the aspect ratio while satisfying the design constraints that have to date limited aspect ratios of modern transport aircraft wings, such as aero-elasticity and buffeting; structural design and weight limitations; fuel capacity; and practical issues such as airport runway/taxiway and gate dimensions may yield a sizeable potential benefit in fuel burn and emissions. Long, slender wings may necessitate radically different structural and manufacturing concepts. Load control systems may prove essential to the feasibility of very high aspect ratio designs. Optimal wing span may lead to the need for folding outer wing sections. This topic aims to provide a preliminary design study involving the capture of the current state of the art, an analysis of potential gains through the use of very high aspect ratio wings in the various transport aircraft market segments [regional, short-medium and long range]. Different design concepts should be analysed, paying particular attention to design constraints such as those mentioned above. A proposed ‘best in class’ conceptual/preliminary design should be completed, starting from a selected reference aircraft for comparison in terms of performance. The estimated gains should be validated experimentally by scaled model wind tunnel tests, at least in terms of aerodynamic performance, possibly in terms of noise performance as well.

Reducing aviation emissions calls for disruptive technologies to go beyond the most efficient projected improvements in current technologies. Achieving this goal requires a ground breaking improvement of flow control devices to push engine efficiencies beyond their current limits and improve their operability. Despite the vast range of existing flow control solutions, most of the active flow control systems described in the literature are still far from being implemented on engines. Thus there is a need to explore the design of compact actuators compliant with aeronautics requirements in terms of weight, volume, reliability, and integration (thermal management). Moreover, several flow control technologies, such as plasma based technologies, seem very promising but require a non-negligible amount of energy to function. Therefore, the development of disruptive actuators is closely linked to the proposal of an innovative energy supply. Hence, the aim of this topic is to increase the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of active flow control technologies for engine applications. Proposals are expected to provide the design and manufacturing of an actuator system fitting control specifications and compliant with aeronautics requirements, before demonstrating its ability to achieve reliable control performance and fuel burn reduction, justifying a TRL 4 achievement of the control technology.

To network and coordinate the large scale research initiative on Future Battery Technologies and its contribution to the broader efforts of the European research and innovation stakeholders in battery technologies foreseen at European level and in the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan[1]
Scope:
Proposals are expected to coordinate the research activities and the stakeholders participating in the initiative; to facilitate communication, dialogue and cooperation on cross-cutting topics; to monitor the initiative's progress and maintain its roadmap; to provide support for its governance; to promote and communicate the objectives of the initiative[2] and its achievements, including by ensuring media presence and public visibility, by engaging with industry and society and by participating or organising outreach events; to identify training and education needs and promote European curricula in future battery technologies. In particular, proposals should identify and coordinate relevant efforts for modelling and data sharing, standardisation, IPR actions in cooperation with other relevant initiatives at European level. They should also help networking and collaboration with other relevant national and international activities in the field. They should cooperate with the ETIP on battery announced in the EU Strategic Action Plan on Batteries[3].
It is expected that such an activity is driven by representatives of the relevant actors of the field (e.g., from academia, RTOs and industry).
The Commission considers that proposals for Coordination and Support Actions of a 3-year duration and requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals of another duration and/or requesting other amounts.
Note that special Grant Conditions will apply for projects granted under this topic. In particular, the project partners will need to conclude a collaboration agreement with the other projects selected from the topics LC-BAT-12-2020, LC-BAT-13-2020 and LC-BAT-14-2020 as indicated in the Grant Conditions.

","24 January 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Driven by the needs for a cleaner environment and the transition towards a low-carbon competitive economy, deployment of solar and wind energy increases. The respective energy supply will be much more decentralised, resulting in enhanced needs for deployment of large to small scale industrial electricity grids, and in an increased share of electricity produced in private households. Also industry 4.0 with its new less centralised production methods will need a more delocalised energy supply. And more and more small robotised devices dedicated for industry or private households appear on the market that need energy. For all these new technologies and markets, the respective energy storage challenges have to be solved. This can be done by specific batteries, and Europe has to use its knowledge and competitive advantage in advanced materials and nanotechnologies to strengthen the related battery storage value chain and prepare European industry to be competitive in these new markets.
Scope:
Proposals should cover the following:
Develop more price competitive, better performant and highly safe battery storage solutions, with improved lifetime by lowering the cost and capital expenditure through development of less expensive and more performant materials (e.g. novel advanced electrode materials, including nanostructured and 2D materials and electrolytes), chemistries, packaging and cell design and battery component production processes. The progress should make use of the advantages of the existing EU value chain. Synergies with the electrified vehicle battery production sector could be explored;
Duly consider safety aspects depending on the application, e.g. by consideration of polymer or solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries;
Sustainable materials and environmental friendly production processes, possible second life applications, and materials that are easily available in Europe, in order to avoid market dependence. Recycling should be inherently possible on a large scale, permitting overall costs that will not hamper market acceptance;
The new solution and respective output targets (such as cyclability, reliability, usage and lifetime) should be demonstrated and tested where possible in a relevant industrial environment; and developments in the European regulatory framework as well as the impact on industrial standards should be considered;
To allow comparison with currently existing solutions, a full life cycle assessment covering environmental and economic aspects of the proposed alternatives should be included.
Activities should start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The performance levels of the proposed solution(s) should be in line with those specified in the relevant parts of the SET-Plan.[1] The new developments should respond to all of the following requirements:
Enhanced market success of the new more competitive and sustainable technologies, obtained by strong reduction of the cost for stationary applications, below 0.05 €/kWh/cycle; the reduction of cost should be at least 20% in all other cases;
More competitive products due to increased life time, with a cycle life for stationary energy storage applications that should be clearly beyond the current standards, and reach at least 5000 cycles at 80% Depth of Discharge; and it should be significantly improved with respect to the state-of-the-art in all other cases;
More sustainable products, with a recycling efficiency beyond currently legal obligations, as established in the Batteries Directive,[2] ideally beyond 50%, and a demonstrated economic viability.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.

Today, battery performance monitoring and control basically takes place only at the module or battery pack level via a battery management system (BMS). To gain a full supervision and thus control of the battery system and to increase their quality, reliability and life (QRL), it is necessary to monitor in operando the battery performance and control of their state of health (SoH), state of charge (SoC), state of energy (SoE), state of power (SoP) and state of safety (SoS). The challenge is to incorporate smart functionalities into the battery cell for following in time and space different relevant cell component parameters such as temperature variations, interface and interphase dynamics, structural changes by the integration and development of various sensing technologies so as to facilitate control of individual cells within the battery system.

The target is to develop a proof of concept for the establishment of successful sensing technologies capable of monitoring changes within a battery cell under various operation conditions, including their use under extreme weather conditions, as a first step towards the development of a wider range of sensing technologies capable of monitoring of cells from various emerging battery chemistries. The proof of concept should focus on the sensing technologies and the integration of sensors in liquid electrolyte cell technologies since it is deemed to be the technology of choice for short to medium term. Proposals should aim at smart functionalities incorporated into the battery cell and relying on the integration and development of various sensing technologies to transmit information out of the cell, in order to facilitate control of individual cells within the battery system. Sensors could be used to simultaneously measure with high sensitivity and resolution changes in multiple parameters, such as chemical composition, strain, temperature, pressure, and concentration of dissolved cations, and this at various locations and for diverse components within the cell, under different use cases, especially during high power charging. They must consider the adaptability of sensors to the targeted cell environment in terms of chemical and electrochemical reactivity, thermal design and foresee boundary manufacturing constraints. Additional constraints such as cost and recyclability of the battery with embedded sensor technology should also be tackled. Data processing within an advanced battery management system (BMS) and the synchronization with sensor data coming from the module and the pack level, incl. provisions for conflicting data management, is another essential aspect. Advancements towards standardisation of the BMS could also be included. With this regard, collaboration shall be ensured with the topic LC-BAT-10-2020: Next generation and realisation of battery packs for BEV and HEV.
All results shall be validated and demonstrate significant improvements compared to the state-of-the art technologies, incl. benchmarking to initiatives or projects supported under national funding schemes.
The Commission considers that proposals for Research and Innovation Actions of a 3-year duration and requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals of another duration and/or requesting other amounts.
The project partners shall make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the large scale research initiative on Future Battery Technologies and in particular: coordinate technical work with the other selected projects of the call under topics LC-BAT-12-2020 and LC-BAT-14-2020; and contribute to the activities of the Coordination and Support Action defined under the topic LC-BAT-15-2020. In particular, the project partners will need to conclude a written collaboration agreement with the other projects selected from these topics as indicated in the Grant Conditions.
Note that special Grant Conditions will apply for projects granted under this topic. Please see under Call Conditions.
Expected Impact:
Increased quality, reliability and life (QRL) of the battery system by maximizing the performance and safety of the complete battery system over its lifetime, including forecasting the remaining lifetime under different use cases, especially the suitability for possible ""second life"" usage.
Assured best possible performance and lifecycle for a range of applied cell types at lowest cost
Industrial opportunities for exploiting new concepts and technologies for integrating multifunctional sensor capabilities in the battery cells and for optimizing the performance of the complete battery systems
Better identification of defective cell components, allowing replacement of components or introduction of local targeted repair mechanisms, such as self-healing, in future cell design and chemistry generations.
Improved knowledge on different factor (use patterns, ambient temperature etc.) impact on battery performance and characteristics.
Provide the foundations for collecting large amounts of data that can be used for autonomous discovery of future battery chemistries and for development of advanced modelling approaches to improve current chemistries with a view of optimizing cell performance for mobility applications (linking with topic LC-BAT-6-2019)

Increasing our daily dependence on batteries calls for increased efforts in ensuring their quality, reliability and life (QRL). While sensing is the natural instrument to monitor and control QRL, it can also serve to identify defective components and local spots in the cell that need to be repaired by injection or addition of self-healing functions.
Scope:
The target is to deliver a proof-of-concept for the realization of battery cells with the proper repairing additives and to elucidate the modus operandi of the specific self-healing functionality by advanced analytical tools. Proposals should aim at developing innovative auto-repairing approaches for cell components such as mechanisms for on-demand administration of molecules that can solubilize a resistive deposit or at injecting self-repairing polymers to restore a defective electrode within the battery. They should lay the foundation for a sound scientific platform on battery self-healing relying on chemical/physical tooling. Whatever the pursued approach, it will have to comply with the electrochemical environment of the targeted cell environment, be readily adaptable to battery cell mass production processes and not hinder subsequent recycling process.

Scope:
The target is to develop a pilot materials platform for computational and experimental material characterization that would pave the way towards the development of a full-scale autonomous battery Material Acceleration Platform (MAP) enabling closed-loop materials discovery, automated characterization, device-level testing and addressing aspects related to manufacturability and recyclability. The pilot MAP should deliver a blueprint of the targeted autonomous material discovery platform that could demonstrate key features such as: the ability to use modeling, simulation and machine learning techniques to determine optimal materials composition, the ability to autonomously direct an automated material synthesis robot in optimizing selected battery materials and the ability to perform autonomous analysis and interpretation of experimental data and of deriving previously unknown structures and compositions.

Optimised storage solutions for thermal and electric energy are needed in order to better synchronise the overall supply and demand, at residential, district and urban level. Efficient management of the peak loads would reduce the overall operational costs of the installations.
The main challenge is to demonstrate integrated thermal storage systems. The current mature technologies for thermal storage are mostly based on water. In order to increase the storage density, it is needed to further develop other systems such as the Thermochemical materials. The next wave of developments needs to be tackled in order to propose attractive equipment with a significant increase in storage capacity efficiency. The combination of renewable energy with storage is key to support the next generation of very low or plus energy houses.

Construction industry in the European Union needs to follow the latest technological developments going beyond Building Information Modelling (BIM). Digital Building Twins should facilitate monitoring of activities and comparison of relevant data against the initially agreed planning. Recent advancements in computing power and deep learning algorithms will allow fully automated pipelines from data generation to processing, and from data capturing to advanced knowledge and decisions. Its adoption faces hurdles due to lack of open semantic interoperability between standards thus making it imperative to create global standards infrastructures.
Scope:
The aim is to develop a digital building twin – a real-time digital representation of a building or infrastructure. This differs from BIM, which traditionally does not include real-time data collected from the construction site or building in operation. The digital-twin concept uses tools and technologies to collect and process real data and information from devices, components, parts, machines on an ongoing construction site and structures in use. With digital twins, as-designed and as-build models will be synchronised thus allowing companies to continuously monitor real progress against the initial BIM-based planning. Methods to ensure interoperability between a BIM and a digital-twin are encouraged.
Proposals should therefore address the following issues based on digital-twins’ applications on construction sites:
Automated progress monitoring allowing to verify that the completed work is consistent with plans and specifications;
Tracking of daily changes in an as-build model, allowing early detection of discrepancies;
Avoiding over-allocation of resources by dynamic prediction of requirements, thus reducing the need to move resources over long distances and improving time management;
Assurance of the safety of workers through a system of early detection and notification by applying artificial intelligence;
Quality assessment by image processing technologies should allow verification of structure conditions and detection of cracks or material displacement, triggering additional inspections;
Optimisation of equipment usage by advanced imaging and automatic tracking.
Proposals should consider how to acquire data (image) and exploit, whenever cost-effective, the use of satellite-based approaches.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The bioeconomy is expected to contribute to the replacement of fossil-based products, materials and energy, thereby helping decarbonize the economy. However European agriculture, the starting point of numerous bioeconomy value chains, still relies heavily on direct fossil energy inputs in farm operations and buildings, but also on indirect fossil energy embedded in agricultural inputs, materials and the related transport. Such products therefore embed greenhouse gas emissions, and need to be addressed through technology and policy. Energy consumption by agriculture made up 2.8% of final energy consumption in the EU-28 in 2014, of which 53% was fossil-based. The potential for the use of renewable energy produced by the agricultural sector to be consumed at the level of farms or group of farms is still mostly untapped. The challenge is to reduce the technical complexity and develop cost-effective solutions for fossil-energy-free farming, and to design the pathways for a de-fossilised agriculture as a keystone of new agricultural agendas and energy systems.
Scope:
Proposals shall address only one of the following sub-topics:
A. [2020] Pathways for a fossil-energy-free agriculture (CSA)
This coordination and support action (CSA) shall provide a framework in which policy makers, scientists and other stakeholders can join forces to conceive and implement ambitious approaches and strategies towards a fossil-energy-free agriculture. The action shall setup a knowledge and policy hub to take stock of past and on-going research, to inventory and benchmark policies and technologies at the interface of agriculture and energy, and to identify good practices.
The outcomes should be translated into attractive and easily understandable materials for policymakers, farmers and rural communities. Such materials should include roadmaps for particularly energy-intensive farming systems (e.g. greenhouses), practices (e.g. ploughing or irrigation) or inputs (e.g. fertilisers or plastics). In this exercise, proposals should consider both direct and indirect fossil energy uses, as well as the possibility of integration with the upper scales of the energy systems (groups of farms / rural communities / rural-urban). The sustainability of proposed approaches shall be assessed from the economic, social and environmental perspectives, including land use considerations.
The consortium shall develop a vision on the de-fossilisation of agriculture, identify enablers, bottlenecks and lock-ins in this transition, and provide a set of policy recommendations and a research roadmap. Interlinkages and synergies with the forestry sector should be considered where common approaches are possible.
B. [2020] Close-to-market solutions for fossil-energy-free farming (IA)
Proposals shall test cost-effective technical solutions for reducing the dependence on fossil energy sources in agriculture, and demonstrate whether renewable energy produced on-farm can be a reliable source to cover the needs of agricultural operations. Proposals shall tackle both renewable energy production on farm(s) and the adaptation of machinery and buildings to these new energy sources, and consider fuel, heat and electricity production and storage as appropriate.
Proposals shall focus on a specific on-farm practice, provided that it is common in Europe and highly dependent on fossil energy consumption. The sustainability of the solutions developed shall be assessed from social, economic and environmental perspectives. Such assessment should consider indirect fossil fuel consumptions and impacts on agricultural land use. At the end of the project, the TRL will range between 6 and 7 (see part G of the General Annexes). Proposers will indicate the estimated levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
All sub-topics: The proposals funded under this topic (sub-topics A and B) should include a task to cluster with other projects financed under the same topic and potentially other running projects dealing with energy systems (e.g. LC-SC3-ES-3-2018-2020 Integrated local energy systems) and climate change mitigation. This cluster will in particular identify the lock-ins, barriers and path dependencies regarding the fossil-energy uses (including fiscal policies) in order to map out the transition pathways for a fossil-fuel-free agriculture in the CSA (scope A). Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1] , with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge clearly activating farmers, technology providers, researchers and advisors.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 2 million for scope A and 5 million for scope B would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposed activities will provide policy and technology solutions paving the way towards a fossil-energy-free agriculture. In the short term, this will help to:
Develop appropriate, coherent policies and strategies at EU and national level.
Reduce farm costs, increase competitiveness and improve farm resilience.
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to agricultural activities.
Raise awareness and help increase the outreach and impacts of European R&I outcomes and initiatives.
In the longer term, this should contribute to the EU commitments on climate change mitigation and the objectives of the EU Energy Union.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The strategic long-term vision[1] published by the Commission for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy calls for a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The European Commission’s Green Deal[2] proposes a new growth strategy that aims to preserve the planet for future generations. It should serve as the compass to emerge from the present COVID-19 crisis and offers the opportunity to bounce forward and accelerate our progress towards meeting the EU climate change objectives. It sets an ambitious target of a 50%-55% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Through its roadmap for action it outlines a long-term vision for the environment, involving all sectors of the economy, geared towards reaching the goal of climate neutrality.
While cities occupy only 2% of the planet’s landmass, they consume over 65% of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of global man-made CO2 emissions. Currently 75% of European citizens live in cities and this percentage is expected to rise to 80% by 2050. Therefore, cities[3] must play a crucial role in helping Europe reach the targets of the Green Deal. The Commission will support their systemic transformation towards climate neutrality leveraging, in particular, technological, non-technological and social innovation and new AI-based solutions.
The challenge resides with achieving significant progress towards climate neutrality at a large (European) scale by fostering climate-neutrality and social innovation in cities. This means capitalising on existing research and innovation, valorising available knowledge in Europe, and using Green Deal-targeted social, financial, and technological innovation to co-create, test, and deploy systemic, integrated solutions, technologies, and incentive schemes with cities to tackle the largest sources of pollution in urban and metropolitan areas. It also implies designing incentives promoting investments such as green infrastructure into cities committed to climate neutrality and the Green Deal objectives. This will help test innovative solutions, technologies, and incentives to reach the scale that will make them attractive for industry economically, for citizens in terms of affordability, liveability, and inclusiveness, and for local authorities as concern effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of life. Testing these solutions and incentives will require listening to the needs of citizens and engaging cities to act. Framing the above-mentioned elements necessitates taking into account the consequences and long-lasting impacts on cities of the current health and economic crisis, affecting for example mobility, transportation, urban planning, digitisation, provision of services, etc. It requires triggering and supporting lasting changes in social, business, and administrative practices and in individual behaviours with clear impacts on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and other co-benefits that citizens, businesses and public authorities find desirable.
Scope:
This purpose of this topic is to develop a one-stop shop platform providing the necessary technical, regulatory, financial and socio-economic expertise as well as assistance to cities for developing and implementing their climate action plans, and related social innovation action plans. The project can involve research organisations, academia, industry including social entrepreneurs, the financial sector including impact financiers, investors, philanthropists, NGOs, national and local authorities and citizens. The project should also be responsible for the management of competitive calls addressed to third parties to fulfil the objectives of this action. The platform should facilitate the coordination of ongoing European activities in the area of climate neutrality for cities and should be sustainable, scalable and self-financed beyond the life of the action. Where relevant, the action should take into due account and build on existing platforms[4], experience already matured by the Covenant of Mayors[5] initiative and methodologies, analysis and processes developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission as well as based on the principles and standards of the Join, Boost, Sustain Declaration[6].
The proposal should address all of the following four activities:

Develop a science-based set of indicators[7] enabling the assessment of the climate, environmental and socio-economic impact of cities’ climate neutral action plan, as well as its replication and scaling potential, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction within the framework of the European Green Deal
Develop innovative urban greening assessment methodologies for planning[8] and monitoring[9] GHG emissions reduction to meet the Green Deal ambitious targets.
Provide harmonised specifications for inter-operable and comparable evidence repositories for cities, documenting action plan approaches and impacts;
Support cities in identifying and possibly overcoming regulatory, institutional, governance, financing, public acceptance and other barriers preventing progress and coordinated pathways towards climate neutrality;
Design, in close collaboration with the cities and the European Commission, a concept for a climate-neutral city contract[10] corresponding to climate action plans that includes the application process and assessment criteria. Particular attention should be paid to citizens’ engagement, social innovation and social entrepreneurship, environmental, economic and health benefits, and Just Transition mechanisms.
Support cities in innovating their local governance and, where appropriate, building capacity to implement systemic and integrated climate-neutral policies, also building on existing experiences developed by local networks[11];
Coordinate the group of cities committing to the climate-neutral city contract, ensuring an operational customer-driven link of this action with the cities as final users. Facilitating the sharing of experience and good practices and mutual learning between cities regarding setting up and mainstreaming co-creation processes engaging all relevant actors for the framing, deployment and assessment of their vision, strategy, and an action plan to reach climate neutrality while ensuring shared ownership.
Activity 2: Investment project preparation and finance:
Provide information and consulting services to cities on preparing and financing investment projects for the transition to climate neutrality. This should take into account and build on the good practices developed by global, European and national initiatives and programmes such as Horizon 2020, ELTIS, ELENA, CIVITAS, EIP on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC) Marketplace, EIT Climate KIC, Intelligent Cities Challenge (ICC), European City Facility, JPI Urban Europe, Positive Energy Districts, Green City Accord, the European Green Capital award. Financial solutions should include, but should not be restricted to, those provided by InvestEU, EIB, EBRD and the European Structural and Investment Fund. Collaboration with national development banks as well as commercial banks is also encouraged.
Activity 3: Social innovation and citizens’ engagement:
Support cities and local communities in testing solutions (including new technologies, non-technological, and social innovations) that stem from European R&I. This should entail a matching of cities’ and local communities’ needs to R&I results through various means, e.g., match-making and brokerage hubs;
Combine existing results of European R&I with social innovation, and take advantage of the digital transformation and digital infrastructure to co-create and test solutions with local communities, including changes in social practices and behaviour;
Provide support to cities for reinforcing not only communication but also citizens’ engagement activities involving also marginalised or vulnerable to exclusion citizens. This should include sharing and using good practices on social innovation as well as enabling cities and local communities to exchange experiences and learn from each other when testing and implementing solutions, connecting more innovators and researchers and making them aware of citizens’ needs, and, though all these channels, helping cities move closer to climate neutrality.
Activity 4: Research and Innovation for climate-neutral transformation of cities:
Once the services of the platform are made available, open calls for proposals will be launched to support large scale pilots for the deployment in lead cities or districts of systemic solutions combining, as appropriate, technological, nature-based, social, cultural, regulatory and financial innovation and new business and governance models to underpin the climate transition, taking stock of existing best practises and already available solutions. These calls should be evaluated by external, independent experts in a fair and transparent process.
In order to facilitate the upscaling of these solutions and their replicability, the pilots will also support for each lead city and/or district, activities dedicated to the twinning with and mentoring of at least 2 other cities and/or districts from different EU Member States or H2020 associated countries facing structural disadvantages or with a size smaller than 50 000 inhabitants, which are willing to develop their proper climate action plan and implement it in a subsequent phase beyond the life of the current action.
This action aims at a rapid, full-scale deployment of systemic and integrated climate actions at city or district level in order to reach climate neutrality by 2030. It should integrate a package of measures covering all sectors such as health promotion, water, food, energy, industry, housing (private housing and public buildings such as schools and other critical infrastructures), transport (including connected mobility and modal shift) and other sectors considered essential for climate neutrality, with digital, circularity as well as nature-based solutions as critical enablers, while respecting the do no significant harm (DNSH) principle in the specific city context and the set timeline.
Cities and/or local communities participating in the pilots are expected to engage the necessary resources and commit to the deployment of their action plan and the achievement of the expected impacts stated below.
This action, in particular the activities covered under Activity 4, allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. Due to the nature of the work to be supported under the call(s) supporting deployment of innovative solutions, the contribution to a third party may go beyond EUR 60 000. The Commission considers that the size of the pilots should range between EUR 0.5 million up to EUR 1.5 million, depending on the expected impact of the proposed projects. The selection of the third parties to be supported under the grant will be based on an external review by independent experts of the proposed work.
The open calls for proposals to be launched within the grant for the selection of third parties should respect all the rules and conditions laid out in Annex K of the Work Programme, in particular as regard transparency, equal treatment, conflict of interest and confidentiality.
The consortium should possess, among others, good knowledge and expertise in European urban-relevant programmes and initiatives, urban planning, state-of the-art in technological innovation for climate neutrality, social innovation and stakeholders engagement, financing programmes (such as the, Horizon 2020, European structural and investment funds, EIB, EBRD…) and European / international umbrella organisations (such as the C40, CIVITAS, POLIS, EU Covenant of Mayors/ Global Covenant of Mayors, ICLEI etc.).
Proposals should ensure that an appropriate geographical balance across Europe is achieved through twinning activities and other means to maximise impact without leaving anyone behind, and by demonstrating commitment of cooperation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a typical contribution from the EU up to EUR 53 million would allow this specific area to be addressed appropriately, of which at least 60% should be allocated to activities covered under Activity 4 for the financial support to third parties. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
As the scope of this action is to support a one-stop shop platform, at most one proposal is expected to be funded under this topic.
Expected Impact:
Contribution to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 in the participating leading cities and districts due to the development and deployment of a comprehensive methodology, including selecting criteria, and model covering cross-sectoral governance, citizens participations, social innovation and social entrepreneurship impact, financing and policy approaches, and an urban digital platform;
Systemic transformation of cities towards climate neutrality, via support from a European level structure;
Crossing of social tipping points and implementation of the Green Deal, through social innovation that empowers cities and local communities;
Leading the transition to climate neutrality by mobilising the demand (citizens’ needs) and showcasing testing of innovative solutions drawing from European R&I through a socially inclusive mechanism;
European cities moving towards climate neutrality by 2030 through measures that demonstrate visible substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution as part of an agreed pathway to climate neutrality by 2050 or earlier;
Improved share of sustainable and active transport modes. Reduced negative externalities of urban and peri-urban transportation: congestion, pollution and road collisions. Enhanced multimodality and facilitated use of sustainable and clean modes of transport.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The science underpinning the European Green Deal has outlined what is at stake in terms of the impacts of climate change, the need to adapt to them, and the need to pursue decarbonisation pathways towards net zero. However, the challenges of mitigation and adaptation will ultimately be met by business and investors, government, and citizens. These actors therefore need to be empowered with solutions that are in keeping with scale of the challenge. As today’s planning decisions affect our emissions and resilience for decades ahead, decision-makers need to know which modes of production, consumption and lifestyle are compatible with climate-resilience and pathways achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions still fail, to a large extent, to incorporate social and behavioural factors that would increase efficiency towards our climate goals, and overcome barriers preventing achieving those goals.
Scientific research has provided a vast variety of information on the climate system, the impacts of climate change at different scales and options for adaptation as well as integrated assessments of mitigation pathways. However, actions are needed for relevant and practical climate adaptation and mitigation solutions and information to reach the end users, help them in building the climate-neutral future they want and address environmental challenges posed by climate change. Actions are also needed to support the use of climate information in risk management and planning across sectors and regions.
Scope:
This action should contribute to informing citizens and decision-makers about the impacts of climate change in the decades to come, identify adaptation options, and illustrate what pathways towards climate neutrality entail in terms of production, consumption, planning and lifestyle, incorporating behavioural factors. In particular, the last mile of the climate service delivery should be tackled for the most relevant sectors, in order to deliver solutions towards meeting the decarbonisation goals of the European Green Deal as well as adaptation options for dealing with climate change impacts.
The projects under this topic should cover some of the following aspects:
Building on existing services and frameworks, such as Copernicus, GEOSS, EMODnet and ESA actions. This includes addressing the downstream part of the value chain and engage with end users and stakeholders, customising of data and exploitation platforms, the use, scale-up and replication of existing service models, brokerage of knowledge and dissemination to the public;
Build robust knowledge on how the climate is changing at a scale meeting the user’s needs, and what impacts are to be expected at sectoral and regional levels in Europe. Identification of barriers to the predictive potential of climate adaptation models should be addressed, including by blending the latest information from climate models, downscaling products, observations, user or citizen knowledge or other intelligent ways of filtering relevant information for users;
Synthesising/exploiting this knowledge in a way that bridges the gap between the expert tools already used by scientists, and the needs of stakeholders who are making decisions today that will both, affect and be affected by climate change and its impacts;
Making the above findings accessible to the public, going beyond existing tools in both scientific robustness and user relevance;
Demonstrating the climate services in a near-to-operational environment with the provision of guidance services and measuring the results through key performance indicators defined with users and stakeholders;
Multiplying the outreach through scaling up and replication to a number of players in the business and public sector, as well as in less represented areas in Europe and beyond. This includes the development of appropriate business models and knowledge brokerage activities as well as activities to tackle other relevant barriers, such as quality assurance and standards, institutional barriers, capacity building.
Actions under this topic should more specifically focus on one of the following aspects:
Converting the mitigation pathways that are compatible with EU climate goals and adaptation strategies for potential impacts to 2050 and beyond into clear information about how climate change impacts will evolve and how production, consumption, infrastructure and lifestyle needs to change. Including consideration of co-benefits and trade-offs, and insights into the drivers and barriers for these changes, and how barriers can be overcome;
Contributing to delivering the next-generation of climate services, in collaboration with the commercial sector, through addressing part or all of the downstream part of the value chain, focusing on sectoral and geographical gaps, providing actionable information to non-specialists for adapting to extreme climate events and new climatic conditions through tools, platforms (e.g. GEOSS & Copernicus) and/or mobile applications.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 to 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged in particular for this topic addressing the climate priority of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO).
Expected Impact:
Enable citizens, stakeholders and decision-makers to factor climate change and climate action into the decisions that will affect our lives for decades to come;
Contribute to the exploitation of information and data from the Copernicus programme and GEO initiative;
Improve robustness and predictive quality of data, and information and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation;
Bring a step change in the use of knowledge and information and allow users to become active players in climate action;
Make high-level information on climate change more accessible to people’s lives and to provide data in a format that makes it useful for its users;
Improve European capacity regarding availability of solution to adapt to and mitigate climate change, including by tackling sector and/or geographical gaps;
Provide appropriate responses to European and international climate policies we committed to;
Increase resilience of society, organisation (private and public), and individual to multiple risks;
Support the development of the European Service sector regarding end-user climate services."

","Innovation action
","22 September 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Fit for purpose and sustained ocean and sea observations are essential for understanding and forecasting ocean behaviour. Measures to protect marine social-ecological systems and support the blue economy are based on these insights and forecasts. 10-20 years ago, marine data from these observations were difficult to find, only accessible through long and sometimes costly negotiations and hard to put together to create a complete picture because of different standards, nomenclature and baselines.
For the past two decades, the European Union invested in policies and infrastructures to enable this sustainability and fitness for purpose. Its Member States, together with neighbours, have created an unrivalled marine data, modelling and forecasting infrastructure, essentially based on EMODNet – the European Marine Observation and Data Network - gathering in-situ and reference ocean data in Europe and the Copernicus marine environment monitoring service (CMEMS) providing European and global operational ocean forecasting and ocean climate services based on the assimilation of these in-situ ocean observation into numerical ocean models. They are supported by European Research Infrastructures and by major R&D projects to deploy ocean observatories at sea and collect marine data (e.g. Eurofleets+, EuroArgo, Jerico, Danubius, EMBRC, EMSO, ICOS, LifeWatch, etc). Cooperation and the principles of free and open access, interoperability, and “measure once, use many times”, were largely promoted, as well as the added-value demonstrated through Copernicus, the European Research Framework Programmes FP7 and Horizon 2020, Blue Cloud and EMODnet activities.
The Digital Twin of the Ocean concept is to make a step further by integrating all European assets related to seas and oceans (data, models, physical ocean observatories at sea) with digital technologies (cloud, super HPC capacities, AI and data analytics) into a digital component that represents a consistent high-resolution, multi-dimensional and (nearly) real-time description of the ocean. It will contribute to the Commission’s Green Deal and Digital Package commitments to develop a very high precision digital model of the Earth (Destination Earth initiative).
AI and analytics, thematic or sectorial models and computing power will transform data into knowledge. They will facilitate co-creation and inter-disciplinary approaches between natural sciences, humanities and social sciences for the co-construction of methods, expertise and applications to support decision making. This digital view of the ocean will enable a multi-angle perception of the ocean: its physics, chemistry, geology, biology as well as the environmental and socio-economic impact of human activity.
It will be a simulator to test scenarios that deal with different evolutions of the ocean environment. It will empower citizens, governments and industries to collectively share the responsibility to monitor, preserve and enhance marine and coastal habitats, while supporting also a sustainable blue economy (fishing, aquaculture, transport, renewable energy, etc.). It will enable measures to increase resilience to climate change, improve disaster risk management, develop spatial plans, report on the state of the environment, coastal or offshore activity and measure its impact.
Scope:
Proposals for such a development should demonstrate their usefulness with regard to Green Deal priorities (e.g. impact of ocean climate scenarios on aquaculture and fisheries, impact of sea-level rise and extreme waves on coastal risks, pollution monitoring and scenarios for mitigation and remediation strategies, and maritime spatial planning). It needs to fulfil all of the following criteria: deliver break-through in accuracy and realism, represent optimal synergy between observations and models; fully integrate downstream impact sectors of the socio-economic areas addressed in their test case; include a rigorous handling of quality and confidence information.
Proposals should address:
The development of an ocean digital twin at high resolution including the ocean model representation and the integration of all available datasets into a single digital framework compatible of Destination Earth infrastructure and technologies (cloud, euroHPC, AI-ready standards, datacubes, …). It should build on existing infrastructures and relevant Horizon 2020 and R&D projects to achieve this integration at short-term (e.g. CMEMS, BlueCloud, EMODNet, portals from ERICs, IMMERSE, ESA Ocean Science Cluster);
The configuration of it as a simulation environment built on a consistent multi-variable multi-dimensional description of the ocean consistent from estuaries to the coast and to open ocean, from the surface to the seabed and allowing a digital exploration in time and space of the ocean physics and biodiversity according to different scenarios. It should provide an integrated, timely and persistent description of the ocean including at least physics, biogeochemistry, geology and human activities;
The integration of data from existing or new automated sensors and autonomous mobile and fixed platforms, additional structured and unstructured data, alternative sources such as private companies data, citizen science or historic data collected before the digital age (chemical, physical, biological and ecological) and delivered through EMODnet and Copernicus;
The implementation of data and model outputs in state-of-art standards and formats (INSPIRE, FAIR, ontologies, …) compliant with their exploitation by applications and appropriate user interfaces based on big data and artificial intelligence technologies;
The development of what-if scenarios to validate the representativeness of the digital ocean simulator in “real conditions of use” by configuring different ocean conditions and exploiting AI/data analytics tools, on concrete cases in local or regional sea basins.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.
Expected Impact:
The action will deliver a digital interactive framework based on digital technologies compatible of Destination Earth and the Digital Package including an digital ocean simulator based on a high-resolution numerical model of the ocean, including available ocean observation datasets in Europe and digital analytic toolboxes to configure the digital ocean simulator and to access what-if scenarios.
This will enable:
Complementing the core European existing operation ocean forecasting and ocean climate services provided by Copernicus to European public, scientific and private users, with a simulation capacity that will enable the plug-in of vertical applications based on innovative solutions (sectorial methods, coupled models, statistical approaches, assimilation, ensembles, massive computing, deep learning, …) to support science-driven policies implementation;
Moving towards a European Ocean Observing System, fully integrated with multidisciplinary observatories of estuarine, coastal and marine environments and socio-ecological systems, and promoting shared data management strategies (infrastructure development, data standardization, sharing, availability, access, interoperability, visualisation and use of data according to the FAIR principles).
It will:
Support science-driven approaches to policies implementations by users that reinforce conservation and ecosystem-based management of marine habitats/green infrastructure, improve the planning and management of marine areas, and safeguard productivity and biodiversity of marine ecosystems and how this is influenced by the river-to-sea interaction;
Increase citizen engagement, taking into account cultural and emotional aspects, through increased awareness and understanding of the dynamics, interactions and evolution of seas and oceans and their role in our well-being and survival, and promoting bottom-up actions, empowering citizens in innovative co-designed services and new project designs where citizens' opinions are considered from the initial stages;
Encourage and enable the infusion of ‘non-scientific data streams’, in a coordinated way, through citizens engaged in data gathering, and through joint efforts from a community composed of users of the sea, including private companies, public authorities, social innovators, researchers, citizens and policy makers;
Support industry to develop new business models and opportunities in ocean data and related services.
Facilitate the operationalising of long term observing systems and contribute to the objectives of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.

With the successful introduction of electrified vehicles on the market, the upcoming challenge is to achieve affordability, user friendliness and optimization of the infrastructure. In parallel to the ongoing developments of vehicles powertrains, electronics and sub-systems innovations will enable new functionalities in EVs. On the infrastructure side, variable and higher charging power are coexisting and connected services are currently under development. New developments in the electronic architecture as well as in the system integration of innovative sub-systems in the vehicles are required to leverage the benefits of new functionalities for the user. The topic should contribute to face the challenge of the development of new components, systems and architectures required for the next generation of electrified vehicles that will allow to meet end-users expectations in terms of cost, convenience of long range travel and comfort, by finding for each application the best compromise between fast charge, battery size and battery life.
Scope:
Proposals will have to address one or more of the following technical areas:
Integrated electric/electronic architectures (incl. high voltage) and control systems for third generation electrified vehicles powertrains.
Development of smart bus systems, electric motors, power electronics enabling drastic size and weight reduction, when integrated in batteries and motors and modular approaches, connectivity and systems for enabling automated driving functions, have to be considered.
Modular and flexible on-board charging optimized for infrastructure capabilities taking into account variable power with up to 350 kW
Breakthrough heating and cooling concepts to minimize the impact on vehicle range in extreme conditions.
For each of technical areas reliability, safety and security have to be considered – including for instance electromagnetic compatibility and sensorisation of components. Coverage of research on all quality aspects is required to keep quality high and costs due to failures low using components and sub-systems for the 3rd generation. Research topics are like modelling of aging, lifetime, bonding, packaging, cooling, manufacturing in general, traceability and a database for failure mechanisms.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Significant advancements of e-powertrain technology – according to the targets in the latest version of ERTRAC's “European Roadmap - Electrification of Road Transport” – e-motors, power electronics, charging system with high impact on overall powertrain efficiency
Affordability of the developed components and subsystems should be improved by demonstrating a minimum of 20% cost reduction in mass production (in comparison to the cost of the best current generation components) and user friendliness in terms of reach and charging procedures.
The integration of new components and functionalities on the vehicle (similar innovation in battery packs is included in GV6) and on the infrastructure side in GV3 should allow the development of new concepts for affordable FEVs which enable long duration trips (e.g. 700-1000km day trips across different Member States) with not more than 60-90 minutes additional travel time (due to charging) and without additional degradation impact on the FEV power train including the battery
Automotive quality enabled in the whole system with new functionalities.
The impact on overall efficiency increase of the new functionalities should be demonstrated with a full size hardware implementation in an existing demo vehicle.

Significant advances in digitization offer new opportunities for the automotive industry in terms of virtual product development and production, reducing the time-to-market of all types of electrified vehicles at lower costs. The increasing hybridisation and electrifications (i.e. multi-energy powertrains including for instance, BEVs, PHEVs and FCEVs on the same platform) leads to significant increased number of vehicle variants and increased system complexity requiring a large upfront concentration of development activities by means of digitalization in order to keep development times at comparable levels as today. Optimisation of the various parameters (for instance, the proportion of power and energy between battery and engine/fuel cell in PHEVs and EREVs) on such platforms requires advanced simulation capabilities at vehicle level (excluding engine/fuel cell development). Furthermore, by exploiting the potential benefits of digitization to the full, radically new multi-disciplinary, cross organisational and connectivity-based approaches to electric vehicle design and production should be possible which in turn will enable the development of new vehicle concepts, architectures, and integrated solutions with significant reductions in time-to-market, energy consumption and emissions over the full life-cycle while enabling performance and safety to be improved.

Proposals will have to address at least one of the following technical areas:
Development of fully integrated, multidisciplinary, scientific-based and validated design tools (including processes) that exploit high performance computing resources and enable the efficient design, personalisation, optimization and flexible manufacturing of electrified vehicles and their components;
Development of high-confidence, real-time capable simulation models for virtual and X-in-the-loop testing;
Seamless integration and validation of computational tools and product/processes across the entire value chain including the handling of all kinds of uncertainties along the value chain while managing digital upgrades and ensuring traceability of data used;
Development of strategies and processes enabling the seamless validation of simulation models with physical data from experimental testing facilities;
Development of simulation environments capable of merging the different technologies involved (digital, communications, physical domain, software…);
Development of concepts and methods utilizing data-mining and machine-learning in the automotive industry, supporting decision-making processes and circular economy approaches;
Digitalization and optimisation of electrified vehicles and components production processes utilizing virtual tools, big data and connectivity;
Value driven design and assessment methods and tools for including novel technologies to enhance system performance that lead to a radical simplification of EVs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million depending on the number of addressed areas would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Substantial reduction in BEV, FCEV and (P)HEV lead-time and time to market (-20%) with consistent or improved quality through digital integration of design with manufacturing and supply chain.
Increasing multipower platforms development efficiency at minimized costs despite increased complexity such as modularity.
Accelerated uptake of innovations leading to increased market penetration of more energy-efficient vehicles and hence faster and more flexible reaction to the dynamics of mobility and transport demands.
Supporting circular economy through fully integrated tools across the entire value chain and life-cycle.
Improved integration of suppliers, SMEs and research into the automotive product development leveraging the EU competitiveness.

","31 October 2017
","19 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
Automotive emissions control technologies have the potential to greatly reduce the impact of combustion-based transport. However most of them, even when programmed for full effectiveness by the vehicle manufacturer, are affected by the risk of vehicle owners modifying or suppressing them for many reasons.
Three way catalysts (TWC) systems in gasoline and natural gas vehicles, Diesel particle filters (DPF), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems have been tampered with since many years because they can limit engine power, create maintenance problems, increase the consumption of fuel or simply because of the high cost of their replacement when they reach the end of their useful life or in case of malfunction. More recently, tampering has also become widespread on Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems, particularly for heavy duty vehicles[1], as the urea-based liquid needed for their functioning is an additional cost for the operator. Finally there are systems providing a remapping of the engine control to increase power and this often leads to strong increases in emissions. For each of these issues there are do-it-yourself as well as 'professional' solutions offered by private enterprises, often on the internet.
In addition, there are also concerns[2] that On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems, that are intended to signal to the user when the after-treatment system is not working properly, are not always properly functioning and this facilitates tampering while allowing environmentally-damaging component aging or failure to go undetected.
Tampering also exist for other important devices, such as tachographs or alcolocks. At the same time, automotive-type de-pollution technologies are applied in other sectors, such as rail, inland navigation, generators, earth-moving machinery, etc and any anti-tampering solution would also be relevant for these applications. In addition synergies can be sought with cybersecurity efforts in other domains.
The challenge is to ensure that all the above mentioned systems cannot be bypassed or modified and therefore maintain their full operational capability through the life of the vehicle, and to provide input to any legislative initiatives that might be needed to improve the implementation of protection systems and the repression of tampering devices in the field.
Scope:
Proposals will have to address all the following technical areas:
Independent testing of light and heavy duty vehicles from the field to assess the capability of their OBD systems to detect tampering methods and maintenance issues in real driving.
Installation of representative tampering systems on vehicles, identification of their working principles and analysis of their performance.
Analysis of vehicle hardware and software by IT security experts and hackers (for instance through a Hackaton or prize) to assess the weaknesses of the employed OBD and protection technologies and assessment of the risk of hacking for each type of application (cars, trucks, non-road) and type of emissions-control system, with priority for truck de-NOX systems and particulate filters on all vehicles.
Development and application of enhanced tampering proofing methodologies, coding and electronic component protection systems, both specific or derived from security application from the IT sector to ensure a high resistance to tampering of the whole engine management and after treatment system, while maintaining the capability for certification authorities to assess the software according to upcoming legislative requirements and facilitating quick and safe updates of the system to re-establish its integrity if new tampering systems appear on the market.
Improvement of OBD systems and methodologies including use of cheap sensors, allowing the development of a more tamper resistant OBD and possibly On Board Monitoring (OBM) approaches, capable of also providing the basis for the application of ""polluter-pays"" taxation principles.
Deriving guidelines for improvements in anti-tampering and OBD legislation in coordination with the relevant bodies when and where appropriate.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The developed solutions contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in particular SDG 3 (""Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages"") and 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”) since they will reduce vehicle emissions by implementing more effective OBD/OBM systems that guarantee that end users are informed timely of any emissions affecting malfunction or tampering and strong inducements (performance limitation) are applied in case of severe emissions increases. This extremely high resistance to hardware and software tampering will ensure a strong reduction or the total elimination of this phenomenon.
These impacts shall be demonstrated by tampering attempts developed by independent teams and by the implantation of artificial defects on the different depollution systems followed by verification of their detection in laboratory test conditions as well as in real driving.
Support for improved future legislative and standardisation actions.

","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Significant progress has been done recently in terms of environmental emission (including noise) by the development of Ultra High Pressure Ratio and Ultra High By-Pass Ratio engines. Technology assessments based on the turbofan engine configuration are indicating that there is still remarkable potential inherent in the turbofan engine configuration to be realised to further reduce gaseous and noise emissions. However, as far as noise is considered it is necessary to address the interaction between engines and aerodynamics surface and the engines interaction in aircraft architecture for a better assessment of the gain in term of noise reduction. This is necessary for the above mentioned advanced engines soon available but even more for future aircraft architecture displaying distributed propulsion or closer engine/wing integration.
Scope:
In order to substantially decrease the noise and environmental impact of aviation, in parallel to advances in propulsion technologies, the quest for a full understanding of the noise source mechanism (for example associated with the laminar-to-turbulent flow transition, fully turbulent flow regime, high lift devices, landing gears, etc) remains open especially for future aircraft configurations adopting breakthrough technologies. Hence, proposals should address at least two of the following areas:
Compatibility between thrust effectors (fan/propeller electrically or mechanically driven) and higher degree of integration into disruptive airframe configurations (e.g. Boundary Layer Ingestion, wing distributed propulsion).
A better understanding of the noise source mechanisms for high bypass ratio turbofan engines for evolutionary and disruptive aircraft architectures such as distributed propulsion or closer engine/wing integration.
A better understanding of the noise source mechanism associated with the laminar-to-turbulent flow transition and fully turbulent flow regime.
A better understanding of the leading/trailing edge noise generated at landing by high-lift devices and undercarriage, including new acoustic treatments on nacelle and aircraft structures.
Innovative propulsion technologies to address the critical topics related to the further increase of overall pressure ratio and gas temperatures needed to drive efficiency such as: reducing fuel consumption by improving thermal and propulsion efficiency, reducing Particle Number (PN), CO2 and NOx emissions by advanced combustion technologies, reducing engine weight and dimensions gaining substantial benefits on aircraft level.
The proposals are expected also to develop multi-physics modelling, numerical simulation and optimisation exploiting High Performing Computing capabilities, innovative flow control technologies, and experimental methodologies.
Proposals should ideally address TRLs ranging from 1 to 4. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Results will contribute to ultra-efficient, more silent, regional, short-haul or long-haul commercial, transport aircraft that could result in demonstration activities in 2025. According to the Flightpath 2050 goals pursued by the ACARE SRIA, CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre have to be reduced by 75%, NOx by 90% and perceived noise by 65% by 2050, all relative to the year 2000. Recent achievements assessed by the CSA FORUM-AE and extrapolated at TRL6 in 2020 result in the following figures: CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre about 38% (aircraft, + engine + ATM), NOx at engine level reduced by about 60% and perceived noise reduced by about 50%. The proposals must demonstrate that their targets are going beyond these last and are approaching the ACARE 2050 goals. Proposals must substantially explain how and why their anticipated targets are realistic.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This action is part of the Aviation International Cooperation Flagship called ""Safer and Greener Aviation in a Smaller World"" mentioned in the introduction to this work programme 2018-2020.
Aviation alters the composition of the atmosphere globally, thus can potentially contribute to anthropogenic climate change and ozone depletion. The last major international assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. In addition to CO2, the climate impact of aviation is strongly influenced by non-CO2 emissions, such as nitrogen oxides, influencing ozone and methane, and water vapour, which can lead to the formation of persistent contrails in ice-supersaturated regions.
Beyond the perennial challenge in developing new technologies that can minimize the impact in the medium and longer term, the main objective of this action is expected to address mitigation strategies that will minimise those negative effects by aviation on climate in the short-medium term and are relevant for greener flight trajectories and operations.
Scope:
The proposals may aim at one or more of the following areas:
A. Advance further the international state-of-the-art, through better scientific understanding of aviation emissions with high degree of uncertainty and high estimated impact to climate change, in order to enable greener flight operations.
B. Propose and evaluate mitigation strategies towards operational improvements.
C. Propose and evaluate mitigation strategies towards greener flight trajectories (ensuring complementarities with SESAR JU activities).
D. Propose and evaluate mitigation strategies based on the use of alternative jet fuel pathways that have been approved under or intended to apply for the ASTM D7566 approval standard. A detailed Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach needs to be included taking into account the following key elements: proper co-product allocation methodology, system boundaries, attributional vs consequential LCA and uncertainties from the time horizon, the potential of Green House Gases (GHGs) reduction and economic implications. Regarding the feedstocks, the impact of indirect land-use change (ILUC) on GHGs emissions must also be taken into account and addressed.
Proposals are expected to address the need to design and implement international measurement campaigns, in order to contribute to better climate metric assessments and more reliable physical and climate models.
This action does not address new aircraft technologies on structures, systems, engines nor their integration, towards minimising the impact in the medium and longer term. The projects are expected to formulate specific recommendations for stakeholders on flight planning and on the use of alternative fuels.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged. In particular bilateral international cooperation with China is encouraged for areas C and D with the aim at promoting substantial coordinated and balanced research and innovation cooperation between the EU and China. Proposals under those research areas C and D are encouraged to have an appropriate balance in terms of effort and/or number of partners between the EU and China. China-based participants have the possibility to apply for funding under the Chinese co-funding mechanism and other Chinese sources.
Although the association of TRL to better understanding aviation emissions is not uniquely defined, the implementation of the proposed topic may cover TRL spectrum from 2 to 4.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The topic aims to deliver scientifically founded and globally harmonised policy, regulations and operational improvements to support climate-friendly flight operations. Expected impacts are:
Better understanding the impact of aircraft emissions on climate towards better policy.
International measurement campaigns and international validation of physical and climate models.
Operational improvements in support to achieve the collective medium term global aspirational goal of keeping the global net CO2 emissions from international aviation from 2020 at the same level (so-called ""carbon neutral growth from 2020"").
Enhanced role of the Union in International Organisations and multilateral fora as well as strengthened implementation, governance, monitoring and evaluation.

This action is part of the Aviation International Cooperation Flagship called ""Safer and Greener Aviation in a Smaller World"" mentioned in the introduction to this work programme 2018-2020.
The third challenge of Flightpath 2050 is related to environmental protection and the security of energy supply. At the Paris climate conference (COP21), countries agreed to limit climate change to well below 2°C. Without considerable contributions from the aviation sector to global mitigation efforts, this goal cannot be achieved. Carbon Neutral Growth from 2020 is possible through a combination of non-market and market measures. Regarding aircraft technologies, there is growing evidence that indicates that for airframe as well as for Propulsion and Power Systems (PPS), the projected cumulative impact of developed technologies will fall short of the year 2035 target. These projections account for the latest developments in airframe, weight gains from more-electric aircraft systems as well as advanced gas-turbines, such as expected high thermal efficiencies through intercooling and recuperation and propulsive efficiencies from Open Rotor.
Against this background it is necessary to develop future aviation propulsion and integration technologies with emphasis on hybrid-electric and full-electric propulsion. There is also a need for establishing a common roadmap and prioritize the key enabling technologies for the hybrid/electric configurations, including energy storage (batteries), for the aviation sector.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to address feasibility design studies for aircraft energy system with integrated hybrid/electric propulsion and power generation architectures as well as sub-systems enablers in the context of appropriately projected advances in the next twenty-year framework. Each proposal may aim at several of the following areas:
Development of tools for tightly-coupled inter-disciplinary new architectural feasibility assessment for the hybrid/electric propulsion and power systems, including detailed feasibility design studies for innovative energy distribution, use and storage solutions.
Explore concepts on energy harvesting technologies to identifying, capturing, storing and re-using energy in flight and/or during take-off, landing, breaking and taxiing, which have potential to offer synergies with hybrid-electric architectures.
Explore emerging storage technologies that have potential to comply with aerospace requirements (e.g. performances, safety, dispatch…) for hybrid/electric propulsion and power systems.
Advance further Electro-Magnetic Interference solutions as well as thermal management trade-offs at system level.
Projects are expected to perform an assessment on the applicability, availability and upgrade of research infrastructures for testing and validation with focus on electrical and propulsion benches and computational tools. (incl. wind tunnels, electrical and propulsion benches and computational tools). Projects are also expected to develop updated roadmap with reference to key enabling technologies towards fully electric or hybrid-electric aircraft and explore new relevant regulatory frameworks. Proposals may include the commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency to assist or to participate in the action.
The implementation of the proposed areas of this topic should cover TRLs ranging from 1 to 4.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], multilateral international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries such as Japan, Russia, USA and Canada.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Overall, the topic is expected to contribute to Flightpath 2050 goals, namely towards “environmental protection and the security of energy supply” as well as “maintaining global leadership”. Specific impact is expected in the following areas:
New paradigm shift towards emission-free aviation.
Strengthen the medium and long-term European aeronautics competitiveness.
Engagement of European aviation research community to a highly ambitious topic.
Establishment of roadmaps and prioritization key enabling technologies.
Foundations for next-generation European demonstrators.

","12 September 2019","Specific Challenge:
Emissions from waterborne transport remain a challenge particularly concerning the water and air quality around coasts, ports and urban areas. For shipping and inland waterway transport retrofit technology including for example engine modifications, engine replacement, exhaust gas cleaning systems, PM filters, hybrid batteries, fuel changes, efficient emissions capture and storage system can potentially improve the environmental performance (CO2, NOx, SOx, PM) of existing fleets within the next five to ten years. However, new next generation vessels are expected to be both cleaner and more CO2 efficient. Vessels will be increasingly electrified and hybridised use clean fuels, on board energy storage and employ new technologies such as optimised design, batteries and high power fuels cells integrated within dual cycles and with combined heat and power. Novel large area propulsion systems also offer the possibility of large efficiency gains. To maximise efficiency gains from these technologies a radical rethink of ship design is needed.
Scope:
To address these challenges, proposals should address one of the following two subtopics and clearly indicate which subtopic is addressed:
Subtopic A) To be implemented through Research and Innovation Action.
Develop and validate a concept for a passenger ship powered primarily by high power fuel cells and if more efficient, in combination with a combustion engine or turbine as a combined cycle. On board power should exceed 5 MW and the concept should address issues concerning; combined heat and power, battery hybridisation, reliability, environmental performance on the whole life cycle, safety, regulatory, cost, ship design and layout, power system weight, volume and service requirements. The concept should be founded using LNG or LBG or CBG or synthetic fuels with the additional consideration of the consequences of 100% hydrogen operation. In addition, the critical barriers to development and deployment should be identified together with a road map for their solution. Work is expected to focus on the integration of fuel cell technology within the ship and not the detailed internal design of the fuel cell. Work should build upon other relevant activities such as the development of the IGF code within IMO.
Subtopic B) To be implemented through Innovation Action.
Proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:
Develop and validate to at least TRL 5 innovative next generation high efficiency propulsion systems for ships using electrification and or clean fuels and or renewable energy sources. Consider all aspects of the ship propulsion system including related materials, electrical systems, energy storage and impact on ship design leading towards a zero emission maritime transport.
Develop and validate to TRL 5 highly innovative large area high efficiency or renewable energy assistance propulsion systems such as whale tales, novel wind power or bio mimic devices and their integration into the ship design. Demonstrate and assess on the whole life cycle, reliability, materials and efficiency at large model scale within a variety of conditions. Consider hydrodynamic and overall efficiency, endurance, reliability, materials, biofouling, noise, manufacture and cost.
Develop and demonstrate to TRL 6 innovative, cost effective retrofit solutions for marine shipping which will provide substantial improvements in terms of environmental impact and life cycle cost. Solutions must significantly reduce emission in line with water and air quality objectives and even exceeding current legislative requirements, particularly around ports and urban areas. In combination with distillate fuels, solutions must significantly reduce NOX, SOX and particulate matters (PM), particularly for the most harmful particle sizes, particularly within coastal and port areas. Operational requirements, cost benefits, including effluent disposal costs and procedures shall be considered. Disseminate outcomes and facilitate take up by key stakeholders.
Develop and demonstrate to TRL 6 innovative, cost effective retrofit solutions for inland waterways which will provide substantial improvements in environmental performance. Solutions must significantly reduce emissions at least in compliance and preferably exceeding water and air quality requirements, particularly around terminals and urban areas. In combination with current compliance options (distillates or other low sulphur fuels, required engine operating parameters,…) solutions must meet regulatory requirements and significantly reduce NOX, SOX and ultrafine particulates, particularly for the most harmful particle sizes (including ultrafine particles), particularly within urban, port and terminal areas. Operational requirements, approvals, financing, cost benefits, including effluent disposal costs and procedures shall be considered. Disseminate outcomes and facilitate take up by key stakeholders.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a budget from the EU of between EUR 4 to 8 million each for Subtopic A and between EUR 3 to 5 million each for Subtopic B, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Next generation propulsion solutions will enable a large (>10%) increase in energy efficiency and CO2 reduction. Enable integration of large high power marine fuel cells into ship design and demonstrate their feasibility, cost effectiveness and identify technical barriers to adoption. Enable innovative high efficiency low emission ship propulsion system that may integrate several power sources. Demonstrate the feasibility, efficiency gains, reliability and cost effectiveness of large area propulsers. Retrofit solutions will reduce SOx, NOx and PM pollution from waterborne transport, particularly around ports, terminals, urban and coastal regions and in compliance with urban air quality standards but also at open sea since air pollution can travel large distances. Significantly, increase the take up of retrofit emission reduction solutions in existing vessels. Enhance European competitiveness and support European jobs and growth. Facilitate deployment of innovative green waterborne transport technology."

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy Efficiency services (e.g. Energy Performance Contracting (EPC)) are available on the market already for quite some time. However, there is a big untapped potential in sectors and with actors not yet engaged in services triggering energy, CO2 and cost savings. At the same time, new technologies have emerged opening the door for new types of services which use ICT to better control and steer energy consumption according to market and system needs and to the availability of renewable energy; others are able to integrate energy services with non-energy benefits such as comfort. By bundling various services and benefits, additional target groups, sectors and financial resources can be accessed.
Finally, ICT-tools and big data generated by smart meters, smart devices and sensors will help monitor and verify energy savings and flexibility and thus provide for appropriate remuneration of optimised consumption. A particular challenge for energy services of this kind is that while they aim to involve different services (e.g. system services) and benefits (e.g. comfort) towards increasing their viability, they should nevertheless result in real, measurable energy savings and performance improvements of the overall energy system.
Scope:
Actions should take up and advance smart energy services concepts which have evolved in the market, in parallel with the progressive deployment of new technologies, including concepts which have been developed, proved and tested under Horizon 2020. Proposals should demonstrate that they gather and help converge innovative, successfully tested service elements which are well adapted to the needs of the market and of the potential users and which are compatible with on-going technological innovation.
While the scope is based on the areas identified in the topic LC-SC3-EE-13-2018-2019[1] for the years 2018 and 2019, actions should focus clearly on new revenue streams, the use of innovative monitoring and verification schemes and the consideration of contractual aspects.
More specifically, actions should further develop, adapt and refine concepts for smart energy services that
integrate energy efficiency services with other energy services like distributed generation, demand response, e-mobility and including storage/hybrid energy systems building on contractual arrangements across different actors (ESCOs, aggregators, DSOs, energy cooperatives, obliged parties under the Energy Efficiency Obligation Schemes implementing art 7 EED and eventually the consumers) and/or
integrate energy efficiency services with non-energy related services such as comfort, health and safety and/or
enhance and refine successful energy performance contracting models that engage new sectors and actors and/or include pay-for-performance schemes and/or
factor in include customer individualized energy services as a result of better understanding of customer behaviour and needs derived of new data analytics tools.
These concepts should
use and apply more accurate and dynamic measurement and verification of energy savings and flexible consumption, also in order to ex-ante identify and develop business opportunities; in this use 'big data' generated by smart meters, equipment, sensors and tools for standardised processes;
address potential legal and contractual aspects (e.g. in relation to existing contracts or warranty, safety and data security issues linked to existing and newly deployed equipment).
Given that the service models will have advanced and matured, project results are, even more strongly than under the preceding calls, expected to be considered and endorsed by key market stakeholders. They should take into account any relevant results from concluded or existing projects that are (gradually) available. Projects are expected to consider those elements that promise to yield a particularly high level of business innovation. Energy efficiency should constitute a core aspect of the service models.
Projects are required to follow the H2020 guidance on ethics and data protection[2], taking into account digital security, privacy and data protection requirements including the compliance with relevant directives/regulations (e.g. NIS[3] , eIDAS[4], GDPR[2] ) and relevant National Legislation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Improved viability of innovative energy services.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
An essential part of Europe's clean energy transition is the changing role of buildings from consuming energy to actively controlling and optimising indoor environment while contributing to energy system flexibility by ensuring distributed energy generation from renewable energy sources, energy storage, facilitate smart charging of EVs, smart metering, load reduction through energy efficiency and load shifting through demand response. Innovative technologies will enable smart buildings to interact with their occupants and the grid in real time and to manage themselves efficiently, so as to become an active element of the energy system. Intelligent and connected devices, smart sensors and controllers, supported by the development of new business models for new energy services, will create new opportunities for energy consumers.
Today, the existing building stock represents the main challenge for a more efficient energy use, in buildings as well as across the whole energy system. The smart readiness of buildings may evolve faster for devices and systems easily replaced and installed, than for other parts of the building's equipment such as HVAC and DHW systems due to higher costs of replacement, longer lifecycles and difficulties related to integration in buildings. This installed equipment remains highly relevant for buildings interactions with the energy system, making its upgrade to higher levels of smartness an essential step. The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive introduces a Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) to reflect the level of services offered by a smart building. Once established, this indicator will give a framework to assess the smart readiness of buildings and building units to adapt operation to the needs of the occupant and the grid and to improve energy efficiency and overall performance.
Scope:
Proposals should develop and demonstrate cost-effective low-carbon technological solutions to manage energy within existing buildings and interact with the grid providing energy efficiency, flexibility, generation and storage, based on user preferences and requests. These solutions should be aimed to upgrade existing buildings, either residential or tertiary, using automation and IT to offer new services and control to the building users, thereby improving their comfort and increasing their satisfaction. This upgrade should translate into improvements in the areas put forward by the revised EPBD, in relation to the smart readiness indicator.
Proposals should demonstrate how the smart systems, smart controls, smart metering and smart appliances can be integrated seamlessly in existing buildings to interface and/or to control the major energy consuming domestic appliances that are already installed. These pilots should involve several types of domestic appliances and technical building systems with longer lifecycles (boilers, radiators, DHW preparation, motors for ventilation, windows opening and shading; lighting etc.) and with shorter lifecycles (dryers, washing machines, fridges, etc.), testing several types of control modes (ON/OFF, power modulation, etc.) possible for a given type of appliance. Recharging points for electric vehicles, vehicle-to-grid and other forms of energy storage should also be incorporated in the pilots. The proposed solutions should not adversely affect the original functionalities, product quality, lifetime, as well as warranties of the appliances.
Besides the pilot demonstrations, proposals are expected to include clear business model development and a clear path to finance and deployment. Key partners should have the capability and interest in making the developed solution a core part of their business/service model to their clients.
These business models and exploitation strategies should target the broad uptake of the proposed smart systems into specific building typologies in Europe and their integration with evolving electricity markets, e.g. dynamic pricing or other services and information offered by energy suppliers and/or aggregators. Integrations with other energy networks, e.g. DHC, or other services or IT solutions not related to energy can also be considered.
The solutions should focus on cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness: easy installation and maintenance, maximising consumer comfort (e.g. self-learning) and information on own consumption (e.g. recommendations to the user in order to maximise savings) as well as on gains from its contribution to grid operation.
These solutions should build on innovative technologies, initiatives and approaches contributing to building smartness: semantics, data models, data layers, protocols, software building blocks, APIs, middleware, solutions for smart services, standards, relevant industrial consortia or technology initiatives, etc. Interoperability is essential to ensure the required smart readiness, in particular integration with legacy equipment, user-friendliness and broad market uptake.
Projects are required to follow the H2020 guidance on ethics and data protection[1], taking into account digital security, privacy and data protection requirements including the compliance with relevant directives/regulations (e.g. NIS[2], eIDAS[3], GDPR[4]) and relevant National Legislation.
A realistic estimate should be provided on the total energy savings/year and on the impact of the innovations demonstrated in the project on the total power available for cost effective demand response actions. The projects should involve technology providers (e.g. manufacturers of appliances, movable envelope components, smart control/ home systems providers), energy services providers (aggregators and/or suppliers and/or ESCO's), user representatives, electricity system operators and other actors as relevant.
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 6-8 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers the proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between 3 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the roadmap of the Energy-efficient Buildings (EeB) cPPP.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Upgrade of existing buildings to higher smartness levels, including a significantly enlarged base of existing building equipment and appliances monitored by energy management systems and activated through demand response actions;
Reduction in energy consumption and costs, exceeding the additional consumption from IT and its cost.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive[1], all EU countries have established independent energy performance certification systems supported by independent mechanisms of control and verification. However, current practices and tools of energy performance assessment and certification applied across Europe face a number of challenges.
Assessment processes and certificates have to become more reliable, user-friendly, cost-effective, have comparable good quality and be compliant with EU legislation in order to instil trust in the market and incite investments in energy efficient buildings. They have to increasingly reflect the smart dimension of buildings and at the same time, facilitate convergence of quality and reliability of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) across Europe. The building energy performance methodologies should also ensure a technology neutral approach, be transparently presented making use of International and European standards, in particular the ISO/CEN standards developed under Commission mandate M/480[2] aimed at enabling the presentation of national and regional choices on a comparable basis.
Next-generation energy performance assessment schemes will value buildings in a holistic and cost-effective manner across several complimentary dimensions: envelope performances, system performances and smart readiness (i.e. the ability of buildings to be smartly monitored and controlled and, to get involved in demand-side management strategies). The assessment should be based on an agreed list of parameters/indicators, such as e.g. calculated annual final energy use, share of renewable energy used, past (climate corrected) final energy consumptions and energy expenditure, comfort levels or the level of smartness. The assessment methods should increasingly take into account output measures of performance (actual measured data) making use of available and increasing number of building energy related data from sensors, smart meters, connected devices etc. These new schemes should contribute to improving the effectiveness of certificates, by demonstrating how these could be strengthened, modernised and best linked to integrated national/regional certification schemes within a framework that aids compliance checking and effectiveness of financial support.
Scope:
Proposals should involve relevant stakeholders (including national and regional certification bodies) to take on board the lessons learnt and the innovative approaches demonstrated in the previous projects as well as any developments on the use of EPCs that have taken place in the Member States, in order to further stimulate and enable the roll-out of next-generation of energy performance assessment and certification.
Proposals should develop strategies to encourage convergence of EPC practices and tools across Europe so as to ensure a comparable level of high quality, independent control and verification. The applicability of assessment and the certification schemes should be assessed through a broad set of well-targeted and realistic cases, featuring various locations, building types, climatic conditions and field practices including existing national EPC schemes. The assessment will aim at demonstrating the potential of a Europe-wide uptake of the proposed assessment and certification schemes, along well-defined criteria.
Proposals should also address issues regarding the training requirements and certification procedure for experts that are allowed to issue EPCs. Proposals should demonstrate the benefit of EPCs increasingly covering also work on inspections (Articles 14 and 15 of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive). Embedding the EPCs and their recommendations in broader concepts such as inspections and energy audits, integrating them in wider-buildings related databases (e.g. national EPC databases, national housing surveys, EU Building Stock Observatory), in practices related to quality assurance and reducing the performance gap, and one-stop-shops including administrative, financial and supply side information and linking EPCs to related concepts such as buildings renovation passports, individual buildings renovation roadmaps or building logbooks should also be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Increased convergence of good quality and reliable energy performance assessment and certification and uptake and compliance with EU Directives and related standards;
Increased rate of application and compliance of EPCs and independent control systems with the provisions of EU and national legislation, in a defined region;
Increased use of EPC databases for compliance checking and verification, linking with financing schemes and building stock characteristics research etc.;
Increase convergence of training requirements and certification procedures for experts working on EPCs;
Increased integration of inspections and energy audits in the EPCs.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the performance gap;
Additional market value of the building (single unit) with better EPC class.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The demand for data processing is expected to grow in the coming years. Consolidation is quickly replacing a multitude of small, remote and inefficient data centres with big and more resource and energy efficient data centres. This tendency however does not address specific delay- and security-sensitive small data centres. Moreover the emergence of edge computing, Internet of Things and Software Defined Networks (Network Function Virtualisation) will increase the amount of small data centres at the edge of the network. This is also the situation for server rooms in buildings.
These server rooms, small data centres or other ICT equipment in building (e.g. telephone cabinets) should become more energy efficient, better integrated with the buildings in which they operate, and should maximise where possible the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, district cooling systems, and synergies with buildings’ energy management systems (e.g. space heating and cooling).
Scope:
Proposals should investigate innovative design concepts and advanced ICT solutions for integrated design of server rooms and small data centres in buildings (based on state-of-the-art sustainable data centre designs such as the Open Compute Project or similar), covering as many as possible of the following areas:
Optimal energy performance of the proposed design concepts,
Innovative and energy efficient cooling technologies and/or solutions,
Integration with buildings’ energy management system and energy-consuming systems (using European and global communication standards such as SAREF), taking into account building usage,
Integration with intermittent renewable energy sources
Waste heat valorisation (e.g. recovery, conversion, usage in local low-temperature heat networks to serve urban areas), while minimising the total waste heat production,
Geographical and temporal workload balance,
Elimination of unnecessary repeated power conversions (AC/DC),
Operation of ICT equipment in a wider range of temperatures (to mitigate cooling and airflow needs in data centres but also heating needs in telecommunication cabinets/booths in the field).
For the purposes of this action, proposals should address server rooms or small data centres, with an IT Equipment energy requirement of a maximum of 250 kW or lower per pilot. Proposals should focus on new and/or existing small edge or sensitive (delay and security) data centres and include at least three pilots in three different countries (one pilot in each country) in different climatic conditions.
Proposals should deliver guidelines and good practices to support building designers (architects, engineering companies, etc.) and managers (IT or facilities managers) in approaching the design of server rooms and small data centres in buildings, taking into account the characteristics of the building, the systems and the expected use.
These guidelines should include in particular flexible design concepts (including ICT solutions) for server rooms and small data centres in buildings, readily applicable to a large number of typical configurations (e.g. office buildings in urban areas). These design concepts should be optimized in terms of energy efficiency and use of intermittent renewable energy and cover building envelope, technical building systems and server room(s), and related connections / synergies. The design concepts should also include lessons learnt from the operation of systems. They should be applicable and scalable in Europe, including application under different climatic conditions.
Proposals should include an evidence-based evaluation of the impacts (in terms of energy savings, CO2 emissions and other possible side effects, e.g. on comfort of occupants) of the proposed design concepts. This evaluation should rely on relevant indicators over a representative period of time on a limited set of buildings, systems and server configurations. This evaluation should follow a well-defined strategy that can rely partly on modelling and simulation but should also include tests and experiments in close to real-life conditions, leading to at least TRL 7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
Projects are required to follow the H2020 guidance on ethics and data protection[1], taking into account digital security, privacy and data protection requirements including the compliance with relevant directives/regulations (e.g. NIS[2], eIDAS[3], GDPR[4]) and relevant National Legislation.
Proposals should also include convincing dissemination strategies to reach out to relevant business players (e.g. architects and engineering companies).
Proposals should include the development of business models to trade heat, cold, electricity or energy security and storage. Large and medium data centres have been addressed by different actions under H2020 or other research programmes. Proposals should benefit from the transfer of lessons learnt from these larger systems.
Proposals could build upon the results of previous and ongoing projects.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Innovative design concepts for ICT in buildings, optimizing energy efficiency and usage of intermittent renewable energy.
Demonstration and quantitative evaluation of impacts of innovative design concepts.
Dissemination of the design concepts and related benefits to relevant market players.

European buildings are producing an increasing number of data on energy generation and consumption from various sources (e.g. smart meters, building management systems). Collecting and making available reliable data on buildings is a key challenge for the European Union. Enabling big data for buildings is key to achieving the EU targets. More and better data can lead to enhanced consumer information, contribute to an effective management of energy grids and support the creation of innovative energy services, new business models and financing schemes for distributed clean energy. Data is also a key enabler for reliable and effective policy impact assessments. The collection and analysis of building data, through data analytics tools, will produce statistics, business intelligence and predictive models that will enable reliable and effective policymaking.
Scope:
Actions should focus on developing and demonstrating large-scale pilot test-beds for big data application in buildings.
More specifically actions should:
define a reference architecture for buildings data; and
develop and pilot an open, cloud-based data analytics toolbox.
The reference architecture should ensure compatibility with existing dataset formats across Europe, allow integration with legacy architectures, encourage replication and scale-up and be compliant with applicable EU standards (e.g. privacy, security, intellectual property). The data architecture should be modular in order to accommodate data from various sources including dynamic data from Smart Meters, Sensors and other IoT devices, Building Management Systems (BMS), energy market prices, weather data, currency exchange rates, as well as static data from existing databases such as consumer consumption data, Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) repositories and Building Stock Observatory.
Proposers should perform an extensive review of existing datasets across EU and take into account ongoing initiatives such as:
EC Directives and initiatives (e.g. EPBD, EED, Ecodesign, INSPIRE, Digital Single Market);
Reports and studies commissioned by EC on relevant topics (e.g. EU Building Stock observatory, Data Exchange Study);
Existing frameworks and architectures (e.g. Level(s), SAREF, BIM, legacy formats).
The data analytics toolbox should be able to process big and diverse sets of data and perform Statistical Analysis, Data Visualisation, Business Intelligence (BI) and Predictive Modelling. The tools used should enable the integration of state of the art data science technologies like Statistics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
The data analytics toolbox should support third party development of a wide range of services and business models with the objective:
to monitor and improve the energy performance of buildings;
to facilitate the design and development of building infrastructure (e.g. district heating and cooling networks);
to support policy making and policy impact assessment; and
to de-risk investments in energy efficiency (e.g. by reliably predicting and monitoring energy savings).
The toolbox should foresee communication protocols to be able to pull data from and push data to existing datasets (e.g. the EU building stock observatory) in an automated way without manual intervention (e.g. using APIs). The toolbox should be built on state-of the art technologies and be hosted at a well-known, stable, secure and scalable cloud service provider (IaaS/SaaS/PaaS).
Proposed actions should demonstrate that they have access to existing large-scale real datasets and should engage as many as necessary of the following actors: national and local governments, network operators, suppliers, ESCO’s, building managers & facilitators, the construction & renovation sector and software developers with proven experience in data collection and data analysis. Projects are expected to collaborate with EU-funded projects[1] on big data as well as the contractor in charge of Maintenance and Update of the EU Building Stock Observatory[2]. Proposers are expected to implement large-scale communication and dissemination campaigns in order to engage public authorities and the market actors.
Projects are required to follow the H2020 guidance on ethics and data protection[3], taking into account digital security, privacy and data protection requirements including the compliance with relevant directives/regulations (e.g. NIS[4] , eIDAS[5], GDPR[6] ) and relevant National Legislation.

There is a lack of quality data on the building stock across EU Member States and regions, in particular (but not only) on building energy. Reliable and comprehensive data is needed to enable an accurate understanding of the European building stock’s trends and drivers. This particularly applies to energy-efficiency policies and related measures (e.g. market support mechanisms), which will be more effective if they are tailored based on an evidence-based, data-enabled, assessment of the building stock. For example, the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) calls for benchmarking of buildings through Building Automation and Control System. This approach would require extensive sharing of information between buildings. Data information on buildings may also be of use to building users and to the industry developing products and solutions. They may also help to adapt principles of a circular economy in the construction sector. The challenge is to establish and implement an ambitious vision for the future of data collection on buildings in Europe, enabled by a large and lasting community of data providers and stakeholders across Europe, and promoting cutting-edge technologies for data collection and processing.

Proposals should involve relevant stakeholders (national, regional and local authorities, property management companies, technology providers and stakeholder associations from relevant sectors: construction, facility management, real estate) to stimulate and enable a comprehensive and long-lasting community committed to improve, standardise and strengthen data collection on building stocks across the Europe, bringing together potential data providers and, building on technology innovation that can support wide-scale data collection and processing. Such data is useful for different purposes: for policy monitoring and development of new policies (at any level), to provide information to users or as a tool for the industry to develop new products and solutions.
To this end, proposals should develop strategies to encourage/support collection of data on buildings and convergence of data collection practices, within the community and beyond. This concerns but is not limited to the scope of data collection (which data are collected), the form of data (e.g. formatting) and the role that different actors can play in collecting and providing data (local authorities, private landlords, citizens, etc.). Proposals should also support/promote wherever possible wider availability of data (open access to data). Proposals should ensure that the scope of data collection includes, but is not limited to, data on buildings energy performance and related building characteristics (e.g. type and characteristics of building systems, type of insulation and glazing, etc.).
Projects are required to follow the H2020 guidance on ethics and data protection[1], taking into account digital security, privacy and data protection requirements including the compliance with relevant directives/regulations (e.g. NIS[2] , eIDAS[3], GDPR[4] ) and relevant National Legislation.
Proposals may use the ""Building Stock Observatory""[5] as an example and reference of data collection, monitoring and evaluation of the building stock. Proposals could also clarify how they would support and link to the “Building Stock Observatory” and other relevant initiatives, emphasizing how they could contribute to expanding and strengthening the data feeding of the observatory.
Proposals should also develop and disseminate a vision and roadmap for a more advanced “big data” approach to buildings data collection in Europe (“European building stock data 4.0”). The aim is to propose a roadmap towards a more dynamic and automated collection of data on buildings, eventually leading to a “live” picture of the building stock. In developing and disseminating this vision, proposals will make connections with other relevant initiatives, in particular actions aiming at developing innovative big data applications in buildings. Due to the existence of several initiatives in this area, coordination between actions should be a key element for successful proposals. In particular, proposals should liaise and coordinate with related initiatives supported under LC-SC3-B4E-6-2020 (‘Big data for buildings’) and LC-SC3-B4E-4-2020 (‘Next-generation of Energy Performance Assessment and Certification’), also providing support to communication and dissemination activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Building a large community for buildings data collection in the EU, ensuring tangible and long-lasting engagement of key stakeholders across all MSs and Associated Countries;
Increasing/extending/strengthening data sources for buildings data collection in the Europe;
Improving data feeding to the building stock observatory;
Increased convergence/standardisation towards high-quality and reliable data collection practices;
Increased data use by researchers and the general public;
Simplified data access and sharing;
Convincing vision and roadmap towards innovative big data approaches for the collection of buildings data in the Europe;
Coordination with, and support for the communication and dissemination activities of related innovation actions;
Strengthened links with programmes and initiatives, supported by regional, national and European policies and funds.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Taking into account that almost 50 % of Union’s final energy consumption is used for heating and cooling, of which 80 % is used in buildings[1], the achievement of the Union’s energy and climate goals is linked to the Union’s efforts to renovate its building stock by giving priority to energy efficiency. Buildings are becoming a factor in the generation of renewable energy and energy storage, but still the process should be accelerated.
Renewable energy supply systems are not generally applied to their full potential and their application should be considered as a great opportunity to reduce fossil fuel consumption for existing multi-apartment residential buildings, regardless of their size, pursuant to the principle of first ensuring that energy needs for heating and cooling are reduced to cost optimal levels.
There is a need to demonstrate the real performance (including economic performance) of innovative renewable and energy efficient solutions for heating, cooling and domestic hot water production in multi-apartment residential buildings and to provide information on the overall system performance to the end user.
The analyses of existing building stocks demonstrate the high potential of renewable system applications in multi-apartment residential buildings, in which heating and cooling energy is currently supplied mostly with high valued energy sources e.g. electricity and fossil fuels. The implementation of renewable systems is lower than in single-family buildings due to several barriers.
Scope:
Proposals should demonstrate the cost-effective, heating and domestic hot water production units (including cooling, and/or complementary electricity production, where appropriate) installed in a multi-apartment residential buildings (above 6 apartments) or in a group of few similar multi-apartment residential buildings. This should include an assessment of the challenges and possible solutions to mixed tenure blocks, or owner occupier blocks, where one or more owners can potentially veto a viable scheme. The building envelope should already be renovated. The cost-effective integration of high performance heating and domestic hot water production should be demonstrated, together with calculation of fossil fuel reduction and primary energy savings. It is expected that the proposed solutions with all support systems will already have been validated in an operational environment prior to submission of the proposal (finished TRL 6, please see part G of the General Annexes) and properly documented in the proposal.
The challenge is therefore to apply a new heating and domestic hot water preparation systems (optionally with additional cooling or electricity production as appropriate) and demonstrate their real performance in existing multi-apartment residential buildings with insulated walls and energy-efficient windows. A system should cover at least 70% of the total yearly energy demand of a building from renewable energy sources. In the proposal, the consortium should indicate the percentage of the total yearly energy demand of a building covered by the proposed system.
The competitiveness in the building value chain and its position in growth markets should be elaborated. Proposals should pay attention to providing solutions to eliminate the risk of legionella for domestic hot water supplying unit a part of activities.
The costs and energy benefit calculations, economic analysis including the worst case scenario, return of investment, and the comparison of the alternative solutions (including fossil fuels if used at selected demo sites) should be developed in a user-friendly manner suitable for convincing potential end users for a new system and to guarantee the project outcomes. Proposals should also contain estimates of values of capital costs, operating costs (including maintenance and inspection), pay-back time and system energy consumption. The system investment costs should be expressed in EUR, EUR/kW, and in EUR/kWh.
The system should be scalable for different types of multi-apartment residential buildings and it is expected that at least three demonstration sites are placed in at least two European countries with different climatic zones. The demo sites’ energy consumption and the number of families in buildings differ at least by 80% among each successive installations to demonstrate their scalability. After the commissioning, the system should be run and monitored, for a proper time within the project duration (preferable one whole year), to assess its performance, system energy production, annual efficiency (the ratio between total system energy production and related energy consumption), etc.
The developed system should have facilities to enable remote access, control and parameter settings from end user level. A dedicated application should be available and easy accessible/installed for each family premises to control at least in-house temperature with the possibility to modify the setting points. The entire system, including its control and monitoring functionality, should already be validated in operational environment before the submission of the proposal (at least finished TRL 6, please see part G of the General Annexes)
Proposals should prepare service and repair manuals to support system assembly and installation and further end user’s instructions, assuring high quality and reliability of proposed systems. Proposals should also take into account the need for high indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort, acoustics, air quality, etc.).
Proposals should aim at moving technologies from TRL 7-8 to TRL 8 (please see part G of the General Annexes). In all cases, the activities are expected to be implemented at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 8 by the end of project activities (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.0 and 2.5 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)[1] encourages the use of ICT and smart technologies to ensure that buildings operate efficiently. To this aim, the Directive further promotes smart building technologies and in particular requires the establishment of a Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) for buildings. The SRI will allow for rating the smart readiness of buildings, i.e. their ability to adapt their operation to the needs of the occupant, to optimise energy efficiency and overall performance, and to adapt their operation in reaction to signals from the grid. The SRI will be further developed in consultation with member states and stakeholders, with a view to eventually ensure a broad uptake of a robust SRI reflecting the state of the art in the field of smart buildings.
Since 2014, the EU has been supporting at least 64 projects relevant to this new definition of smart buildings, providing near to EUR 450 million funding. This support has been spread across 35 funding topics and 29 calls for proposals, mostly Horizon 2020 Innovation Actions. Similarly, the cross-cutting issue of building smartness is often addressed as a fringe issue in media, conferences or businesses specialised in energy, IT or buildings. Despite this fragmentation, most challenges faced by smart buildings are common, such as engaging building occupants, connecting and managing various devices and systems, achieving optimal building operation, or integrating buildings to energy markets.
Scope:
The proposals should focus on facilitating the flow and exchange of information between EU-funded projects in the field of smart buildings and the related business, policy and media, e.g.:
Map out the European smart buildings innovation community, e.g. main innovators, lessons learned, success stories and potential market developments.
Identify the main initiatives, media and events in the field of smart buildings across the EU and coordinate the European smart buildings innovation community in their communication, contribution and participation.
Encourage and support the contribution of the European smart buildings innovation community to the promotion, experimentation and roll-out of the SRI in the EU, and to other relevant policy initiatives.
Suggest priorities for EU support to research, innovation and market uptake in the field of smart buildings from the point of view of potential applicants and target markets
Proposals should not necessarily aim at the largest possible census of the smart buildings community or to seek participation in every possible events or initiatives, but rather focus on efficiency in breaking silos and bridging the gaps between innovation, markets and policy (e.g. sharing case studies, communicating success stories, seizing relevant contribution opportunities, etc.).
The proposed consortium may involve representatives of the target groups relevant to the EU smart buildings innovation community, e.g. specialised media, business or consumer organisation, policy or technological initiatives civil society organisations,, etc.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below:
Draw up an overview of the main stakeholders of the EU smart buildings innovation community updated annually;
Improve the exchange of information between R&I and market uptake projects via at least 6 workshops;
Increase visibility of innovation in the field of smart buildings by coordinating the participation in at least 6 major events relevant to smart buildings;
Coordinate contributions of the EU smart buildings innovation community to the SRI promotion, experimentation and implementation, and to other policy or technological initiatives.

The market for deep renovation of buildings needs to be transformed in terms of technologies, processes and business models. The multiple benefits of improved energy efficiency are well known, but more action is needed for Europe to achieve the higher rates of renovation that would reduce energy use and decarbonize the building stock in order to meet long-term climate and energy targets. In particular, deep renovations need to become more attractive to all relevant stakeholders, more reliable in terms of performance, less disruptive for occupants (especially in residential buildings), less time-consuming, less energy-intensive from a life cycle perspective, more environmentally friendly regarding applied materials and more cost-effective. There is a need to demonstrate and roll out holistic consumer-centred solutions that involve the whole value chain, ensuring high levels of comfort and a high quality of the indoor environment.
Scope:
Proposals should demonstrate solutions addressing building fabric and/or technical systems that ensure faster and more cost-effective deep renovations that result in high energy performance. Proposals should include innovations in technology and in design and construction methods with low embodied energy and on-site works organisation, industrialization and lowering cost of energy retrofitting and they should take into account any architectural constraints. They should also include innovations in business models and the holistic integration of disciplines across the value chain. Proposals should also consider energy efficient and low carbon solutions to retrofit building-level heating and cooling systems and the integration of on-site renewable energy generation[1], energy storage systems which allow for optimisation and flexible consumption, and, if relevant, integration with district heating and cooling systems. Proposals could address drivers of building renovation that go beyond a desire to reduce energy consumption and related energy costs. For example, decisions to renovate may sometimes coincide with structural repairs. They could also consider further development and improvement of hybrid energy systems using fossil fuel based heating systems coupled with RES based heating systems as well as the integration of highly-efficient buildings and local energy system solutions such as District Heating and Cooling, including hybrid solutions.
Solutions should include quick and simple installation of components and systems, minimizing disruption for building occupants and the time spent on site. Proposals should include monitoring and displaying of real time energy performance and other relevant data and consider the ways in which consumers and others could access and make use of such information. Solutions should ensure high levels of occupant comfort (thermal, visual and acoustic) and indoor environmental quality (e.g. air quality, humidity) if possible based on bio-based materials, as well as low risk of moisture-related problems, summer overheating and other harmful unintended consequences, and should address the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. Proposals should demonstrate solutions that aim for large scale roll-out according to defined business models and financial schemes for owners.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy efficiency is not yet considered as an attractive investment by the financial sector which limits the possibility to use external private finance on top of equity of project owners and available public funding. The lack of statistical data on the actual energy and costs savings achieved by energy efficiency investment projects, as well as on payment default rates, results in financial institutions attributing high risk premiums to energy efficiency investments.
Energy efficiency represents high transaction costs for rather small investments, which is not financially very attractive. Technical and legal standardisation is highly needed at all steps of the investment value chain in order to simplify transactions and increase the confidence of financial institutions. The lack of standardisation of projects also prevents securitisation of energy efficiency assets (loans or equity) so that financial institutions are not able to refinance their debt on the capital markets[1].
Whereas energy efficiency investments are usually expected to be paid back exclusively through the reduction of the energy bill, there is increasing evidence that non-energy benefits play a key role in the decision to invest in energy efficiency. This includes for instance increased building value, lower tenant turnover or vacancy rates etc. These benefits need to be quantified through data collection and monetised in order to evolve the parameters used by financiers to assess an energy efficiency investment.
Scope:
Proposals should address at least one of the following issues:
Development, demonstration and promotion of frameworks for the standardisation and benchmarking of sustainable energy investments. This could include for example, but not exclusively, labelling schemes, project rating methodologies and risk assessment tools, standardised legal and financial structures of assets (loans, guarantees, energy performance contracts etc.) in order to develop securitisation for energy efficiency based financial products. Proposals integrated in a broader approach such as socially responsible investment should focus on the energy component;
Capacity building for banks and investors at the national and local level, in particular on underwriting sustainable energy investments;
Gathering, processing and disclosing large-scale data on actual financial performance of energy efficiency investments, in order to create a track record for energy efficiency in different sectors (buildings, industry, transport, etc.) Proposals should build upon or complement the work of the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG) e.g. the De-risking Energy Efficiency Platform[2];
Further integration of non-energy benefits in project valuation, in particular in the building sector, leading to evolution of existing financial products or creation of new targeted products;
Targeting institutional investors (e.g. public pension schemes) in order to increase the share of their funds invested in energy efficiency, or to develop specific funds or investment products. Supporting the integration of energy efficiency in portfolio management strategies for institutional investors and/or fund managers, including through re-definition of fiduciary duties;
Exploring the impact of revised risk ratings and requirements for energy efficiency on financial regulations (Basel III, Solvency II).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Number of financial institutions and other stakeholders reached as well as their potential volume of investment concerned;
Frameworks, standardisation, benchmarking, standardised descriptions and data evidence of financial returns of energy efficiency investments agreed and accepted by the market;
Higher allocation of institutional investments to energy efficiency; standardisation of assets enabling securitisation; development of a secondary market for energy efficiency assets (in million Euro of investment within 5 years after the end of the project);
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (million Euro).
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy efficiency is not yet considered as an attractive investment by the financial sector which limits the possibility to use external private finance on top of equity of project owners and available public funding. The lack of statistical data on the actual energy and costs savings achieved by energy efficiency investment projects, as well as on payment default rates, results in financial institutions attributing high risk premiums to energy efficiency investments.
Energy efficiency represents high transaction costs for rather small investments, which is not financially very attractive. Technical and legal standardisation is highly needed at all steps of the investment value chain in order to simplify transactions and increase the confidence of financial institutions. The lack of standardisation of projects also prevents securitisation of energy efficiency assets (loans or equity) so that financial institutions are not able to refinance their debt on the capital markets[1].
Whereas energy efficiency investments are usually expected to be paid back exclusively through the reduction of the energy bill, there is increasing evidence that non-energy benefits play a key role in the decision to invest in energy efficiency. This includes for instance increased building value, lower tenant turnover or vacancy rates etc. These benefits need to be quantified through data collection and monetised in order to evolve the parameters used by financiers to assess an energy efficiency investment.
Scope:
Proposals should address at least one of the following issues:
Development, demonstration and promotion of frameworks for the standardisation and benchmarking of sustainable energy investments. This could include for example, but not exclusively, labelling schemes, project rating methodologies and risk assessment tools, standardised legal and financial structures of assets (loans, guarantees, energy performance contracts etc.) in order to develop securitisation for energy efficiency based financial products. Proposals integrated in a broader approach such as socially responsible investment should focus on the energy component;
Capacity building for banks and investors at the national and local level, in particular on underwriting sustainable energy investments;
Gathering, processing and disclosing large-scale data on actual financial performance of energy efficiency investments, in order to create a track record for energy efficiency in different sectors (buildings, industry, transport, etc.) Proposals should build upon or complement the work of the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG) e.g. the De-risking Energy Efficiency Platform[2];
Further integration of non-energy benefits in project valuation, in particular in the building sector, leading to evolution of existing financial products or creation of new targeted products;
Targeting institutional investors (e.g. public pension schemes) in order to increase the share of their funds invested in energy efficiency, or to develop specific funds or investment products. Supporting the integration of energy efficiency in portfolio management strategies for institutional investors and/or fund managers, including through re-definition of fiduciary duties;
Exploring the impact of revised risk ratings and requirements for energy efficiency on financial regulations (Basel III, Solvency II).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Number of financial institutions and other stakeholders reached as well as their potential volume of investment concerned;
Frameworks, standardisation, benchmarking, standardised descriptions and data evidence of financial returns of energy efficiency investments agreed and accepted by the market;
Higher allocation of institutional investments to energy efficiency; standardisation of assets enabling securitisation; development of a secondary market for energy efficiency assets (in million Euro of investment within 5 years after the end of the project);
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (million Euro).
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

Investors and lenders need to gain more confidence on investment projects related to energy efficiency which are still seen as risky and fragmented. EU added value can be realised in particular where projects introduce innovation to the market regarding project aggregation and financing solutions minimising transaction costs and engaging the private finance community. EU added value could also be realised where projects demonstrably remove legal, administrative and other market barriers for mainstreaming large scale sustainable energy investment schemes.
Scope:
Project Development Assistance (PDA) will be provided to public and private project promoters such as public authorities or their groupings, public/private infrastructure operators and bodies, energy service companies, retail chains, large property owners and services/industry. The action will support building technical, economic and legal expertise needed for project development and leading to the launch of concrete investments, which are the final aim and deliverable of the project.
Proposals should focus on one or more of the following sectors:
existing public and private buildings including social housing, with the aim to significantly decrease energy consumption in heating/cooling and electricity;
energy efficiency of industry and service;
energy efficiency in all modes of urban transport (such as highly efficient transport fleets, efficient freight logistics in urban areas, e-mobility and modal change and shift); and
energy efficiency in existing infrastructures such as street lighting, district heating/cooling and water/wastewater services.
The proposed investments will have to be launched before the end of the action which means that projects should result in signed contracts for sustainable energy investments to that effect, e.g. construction works, energy performance contracts, turnkey contracts.
Whilst proposals may address investments into distributed, small-scale renewable energy sources in combination with energy efficiency, the main focus should lie on capturing untapped high energy efficiency potentials.
Proposals should include the following features:
an exemplary/showcase dimension in their ambition to reduce energy consumption and/or in the size of the expected investments;
deliver organisational innovation in the financial engineering (e.g. on-bill financing schemes, guarantee funds, or factoring funds) and/or in the mobilisation of the investment programme (e.g. bundling, pooling or stakeholder engagement);
demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results towards potential replicators across the EU;
build on the experiences from previous PDA projects[1].
This PDA facility focuses on small and medium-sized energy investments of at least EUR 7.5 million to EUR 50 million. Large scale investments are covered by the ELENA facility.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Delivery of a series of sustainable energy investment projects and innovative financing solutions and/or schemes;
Every million Euro of Horizon 2020 support should trigger investments in sustainable energy worth at least EUR 15 million;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy Efficiency services (e.g. Energy Performance Contracting (EPC)) are available on the market already for quite some time. However, there is a big untapped potential in sectors and with actors not yet engaged in services triggering energy, CO2 and cost savings. At the same time, new technologies have emerged opening the door for new types of services which use ICT to better control and steer energy consumption according to market and system needs and to the availability of renewable energy; others are able to integrate energy services with non-energy benefits such as comfort. By bundling various services and benefits, additional target groups, sectors and financial resources can be accessed. Actions are also needed to structure and label the quality of demand side service providers (like ESCOs aggregators and energy cooperatives) and improve their accessibility for end energy users.
Finally, ICT-tools and big data generated by smart meters, smart devices and sensors will help monitor and verify energy savings and flexibility and thus provide for appropriate remuneration of optimised consumption. A particular challenge for energy services of this kind is that while they aim to involve different services (e.g. system services) and benefits (e.g. comfort) towards increasing their viability, they should nevertheless result in real, measurable energy savings and performance improvements of the overall energy system.
Scope:
2018 (Coordination and support action):
Actions should allow different market actors to get together and focus on developing integrated concepts and models which
enhance and refine successful energy performance contracting models and/or;
include pay-for-performance schemes and/or;
include customer individualized energy services as a result of better understanding of customer behaviour and needs derived of new data analytics tools;
engage new sectors and actors and/or;
integrate energy efficiency services with other energy services like distributed generation and demand response and including storage/hybrid energy systems and/or non-energy related services; these should be endorsed by relevant stakeholders and validated (for example tested around existing projects or projects under development);
factor in potential legal and contractual aspects (e.g. in relation to existing contracts or warranty, safety and data security issues linked to existing and newly deployed equipment).
Proposed actions should cover at least two (but not necessarily all) of the relevant areas and aspects identified below:
Energy service models (like EPC) and services that target new sectors and new actors;
Business models which work equally for energy efficiency and other services, building on contractual arrangements across different actors (ESCOs, aggregators, DSOs, energy cooperatives, obliged parties under the Energy Efficiency Obligation Schemes implementing art 7 EED and eventually the consumers) which traditionally cover different use cases business interests and different revenue;
""Pay for performance""-schemes which focus on permanently reducing power consumption in particular at peak times, thus attracting new sources of financing;
The use of 'big data' generated by smart meters, equipment, sensors and tools for standardised processes enabling a more accurate and dynamic measurement and verification of energy savings and flexible consumption, also in order to ex-ante identify and develop business opportunities;
Additional non-energy features that support the up-take of innovative energy efficiency services and technologies;
Improving the accessibility and quality of demand side service providers while enhancing their access to the market.
Proposals are expected to include clear business model development and a clear path to finance and deployment. Key partners should have the capability and interest in making the developed solution a core part of their business/service model to their clients.
The Commission considers that proposals for Coordination and Support Actions requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
2019 (Innovation action):
Projects should focus on demonstrating and testing innovative energy services in a real environment, across several market segments and across different actors in the value chain. To be economically viable, these services need to be able to rely on sound measurement and verification methodologies. They should cover several but not necessarily all of the relevant areas and aspects identified above, blending in innovative manner different revenue streams coming from different market segments and they should in all cases include innovative verification and monitoring measures. Moreover, they should demonstrate how potential legal and contractual aspects (e.g. in relation to existing contracts or linked to the use of equipment) have been accounted for.
Proposals should demonstrate that the tested business models and services are self-sustainable after the end of the project. The upfront investments in energy efficiency measures (e.g. upgrading of building energy performance) and in smart building systems should be paid back at least in part by revenues coming from energy savings and remunerated flexibility.
The Commission considers that proposals for Innovation Actions requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Where possible and appropriate, the actions should cooperate with the projects funded under the topics: DT-ICT-10-2018: Interoperable and smart homes and grids, DT-ICT-11-2019: Big data solutions for energy in the WP 5.i ICT, and LC-SC3-ES-6-2018-2020: LC-SC3-ES-5-2018-2020: TSO – DSO – Consumer: Large-scale demonstrations of innovative grid services through demand response, storage and small-scale (RES) generation.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Improved viability of innovative energy services.
In addition, proposals are expected to demonstrate, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
A growing offer and up-take of services that combine energy efficiency with other energy services, technologies and non-energy benefits;
A growing up-take of innovative data gathering and processing methods in the monitoring and verification of energy savings and flexibility;
The application of methods and concepts to ensure that: (i) innovative energy services are reliable and verifiable, (ii) service providers are trustworthy and accessible.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The increase of renewable energy generation in the electricity grid necessary to meet the EU's decarbonisation objectives represents a complexity for the management of the electricity grid based on Alternating Current (AC). At the same time, cyberattacks are difficult to fight due to the real-time requirements, the cascading effects, and the coexistence of legacy and state of the art technologies within a digitalised electricity system with an increasing number of access points.
Direct Current (DC)-based systems may provide a flexible, secure and reliable way forward. Many renewables generate in DC and much of the loads and equipment are already in DC. At the same time DC-based converters have become more efficient with the result that DC-based systems could be considered as viable solutions to tackle the aforementioned challenges.. The potential DC grid technologies for the development of the electricity grid thus need to be demonstrated, the barriers to be overcome identified and the business models for further exploitation developed. Exploiting these technologies will contribute to increasing European knowledge and leadership in these areas.
Scope:
Proposals will address solutions for the design, modelling, simulation, development, demonstration, test and validation of new DC-based grid architecture(s) including a MV - LV DC - AC/DC hybrid grid architecture based on a DC underlay grid interconnecting micro/nano-grids. The modular grid planning and development, the “firewall” effect against faults or cyberattacks and the accommodation of higher shares of renewables in a DC-based system will be part of the demonstration and validation exercise.
Different types of generation and loads, including RES, battery storage and electric vehicle (EV) will be part of the demonstrations, which will be tested in interconnected as well as in isolated mode. Each solution proposed has to be demonstrated in at least two Members States or Associated Countries. Each demonstration has to include at least two micro/nano-grids (AC or DC), of which at least one with low-voltage DC infrastructure. Each demonstration has to be interconnected with at least one point of common coupling (PCC) to the existing grid through medium-voltage DC.
TRL will range between 5 and 8 (see part G of the General Annexes). Proposers will indicate the estimated levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
In addition to the demonstration activities, proposals should include a task on the identification of the barriers to innovation and market uptake of the proposed architectures (e.g. technical (including, low-cost DC breakers, WBG[1]), regulatory, standards, safety, acceptance and suitable business models) and pathways to overcome them (e.g. standardisation, such as of voltage levels), including recommendations.
Proposals should foresee the coordination on policy relevant issues (e.g. regulatory framework, business models, data management, and consumer engagement) with similar EU-funded projects through the BRIDGE initiative[2]. An indicative budget share of at least 2% of the EU contribution is recommended for the research work associated with these issues and an additional 2% of the EU contribution for the coordination effort.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of approximately EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The proposed solution(s) will contribute to
facilitating planning and targeting investments in the sector;
increasing resilience of the electricity grid to faults and cyberattacks;
increasing penetration of RES in the power network;
increasing the efficiency of the electricity system.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Today wholesale prices may vary significantly across the different market zones in Europe showing that the wholesale market is not operating under optimal conditions while some interconnectors are underutilised. More cooperation between TSOs and between TSOs and energy producers who are providing cross-border services, in particular at regional level (i.e. involving a group of countries), is an element that is promoted in the future market design to contribute to improving this situation.
Scope:
Proposals will demonstrate integrated hardware and software solutions for cross border flows in the transmission grid in a regional context.
Proposals are required to integrate at least four of the following points:
Improvements of the tools for communication and grid operations, in particular for intraday and real-time markets involving several TSOs in the context of regional cooperation; tools to analyse and simulate risks of the system at regional level;
Better prediction of production from variable renewables and demand response forecast at regional level;
Definition and testing of new cross border grid services called by an increasing share of renewables (flexibility, balancing, decrease of system inertia, congestion, etc.);
Mechanisms to ensure a well-functioning wholesale market, efficient techniques for coupling real time markets;
Enhance cross border flow and trading, enhanced exploitation of assets such as large bulk storage systems, hydropower plants, large scale batteries installations, etc;
Demonstration in a regional context. Priority should be given to regions where this cross-border cooperation between TSOs is being less effective. The demonstration should be supported by the experience of more advanced regions (intra-EU and inter-EU); when dealing with EU-border countries, special attention should be paid to reduce external energy dependence through more efficient cooperation;
Develop guidelines to avoid distortion resulting from the non-harmonisation of regulations between countries.
Proposals should include a task on the analysis of obstacles to innovation under the current context but also under the future market design context and foresee the coordination on policy relevant issues and obstacle to innovation (e.g. regulatory framework, business models, data management, consumer engagement) with similar EU-funded projects through the BRIDGE initiative[1]. An indicative budget share of at least 2% is recommended for the research work associated with these issues and an additional 2% for the coordination effort are recommended.
Proposals should build upon the insights and results of projects that have already been selected in this field under H2020 (information can be found on the BRIDGE web site[1]) and demonstrate their innovative character.
Proposals should comply with the requirements stated in the section 'Common requirements' of the introduction to the part on the Smart citizen-centred energy system.
TRL will range typically between 5 and 8 (see part G of the General Annexes). Proposers will indicate the estimates levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 to 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The supported projects are expected to contribute to enhance regional cooperation:
in the operation of transmission grids so as to bring additional flexibility in the context of an increasing share of variable renewables;
in optimising infrastructure investments and making best used of large scale assets that are bringing flexibility;
in an improved functioning of the wholesale market across borders;
in the development of future common approaches to grid services.
Proposals are invited to identify and substantiate to which of the above impacts they contribute and include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice that could be used to assess the progress during the project life.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Improved knowledge transfer in the innovative SMEs ecosystem, through increased and sustained collaboration between SMEs, public research partners and academia;
Mitigation of difficulties in access to finance for innovative SMEs and thus contribute to enhanced growth and expansion of innovative SMEs;
Improved innovative SME access to new international markets or value chains thus leading to improved market share and sales for innovative SMEs increasing their employment capacity;
Increase public research and innovation funding to innovative SMEs, to spur more high quality collaborations and more innovative solutions;
Pull together national efforts to spur internationalisation and collaboration in innovative SMEs, avoiding unnecessary duplication leading to a simplified offer to beneficiaries, achieving a more balanced geographic participation, ensuring complementarity and improved innovation ecosystems across Europe.
Scope:
The proposal should provide mainly two types of activities. Firstly, regular calls for proposals resulting in collaborative research and innovation activities. These activities should result in a faster time to market, de-risking investment, supporting business growth, contributing to EU and global priorities and supporting access to markets and knowledge. Secondly, through coordination and support activities, the creation of synergies between and synchronisation of national programmes, and a better cooperation and knowledge exchange between national intermediaries.
While collaborative research and innovation activities for internationalisation of innovative SMEs exist to some extent at Member State and EU level the alignment of national programmes and more effective and efficient processes of intermediaries and funding bodies are not addressed in instruments and programmes other than the Eurostars 1 and 2 programmes, supported under previous framework programmes. The initiative should draw on the experiences, and build on the successes, of those predecessor programmes.
There is a clear added value and ‘selling point’ for the initiative to further address gaps towards a better alignment and increased focus on internationalisation. This reflects the definition of European Partnerships in the Horizon Europe regulation[1] as initiatives where the union and its partners ‘commit to jointly support the development and implementation of a programme of research and innovation activities, including those related to market, regulatory or policy uptake.’
The below list of specific activities, going beyond research and innovation activities, can therefore be implemented under the partnership and are anticipated as expected outputs:
Support transnational near-market collaborative research and innovation addressing technological and societal challenges;
Enhance SME readiness (absorptive capacities in all participating countries),
Attract wide range of beneficiaries by country and SME type and age;
Create synergies among national programmes by streamlining their execution;
Enhance cooperation and knowledge exchange at level of national intermediaries.
The proposed initiative will help innovative SMEs to increase their research and innovation capacities and productivity and to become embedded in global value chains and new markets. It will achieve this by supporting innovative SMEs in developing products, processes and services through funding market-led, cross-border, research and innovation collaborative projects and providing accompanying measures. The initiative addresses collaboration in Europe and beyond, and the commercialisation of new knowledge. Thereby it will strengthen the overall resilience of the European innovation ecosystem.
The overall objective of the initiative is to implement a Co-funded European Partnership for Innovative SMEs to stimulate economic growth and job creation by enhancing the competitiveness of innovative SMEs while contributing to deliver a positive economic, societal and environmental impact in Europe and beyond.
In order to address that objective, the initiative should:
Enable innovative SMEs to develop all forms of innovation, including breakthrough innovation, and strengthen market deployment of innovative solutions;
Foster the internationalisation of innovative SMEs;
Connect national programmes to unlock the potential of all partners.
Type and range of activities
A main activity would be to run calls for proposals, organise the evaluation process and enable collaborative cross-border research and innovation projects. Beyond providing funding to innovative SMEs for cross-border R&I collaboration, they should include further promotion of the programme in underrepresented Member States, including but not limited to, through dissemination events, mutual learning seminars or roadshows.
The initiative should exploit synergies with cohesion policy funds and significantly support the widening aspect. In any case, links with regional smart specialisation strategies should be a priority.
Accompanying measures such as Innowwide should be included in the proposal.
Expected partner composition and geographical coverage
National administrations and National Funding Bodies (NFBs).
The private sector and research actors would need to be mainly drawn from the activities of the national and/or regional funding organisations. The effort, networks and judgements of these organisations are key to initiate cross-border research collaborations, to help prepare applications and to fund successful participants. The success of the initiative depends largely on these organisations.
A dedicated implementation structure may notably support them through various activities and services such as to organise calls, manage funding, monitor payments and projects and implement dissemination events, roadshows, matchmaking events, webinars etc.
The initiative should have an extended geographical coverage beyond Member States and Associated Countries, and the potential to evolve towards a global programme under Horizon Europe, including through possible involvement of additional partners during the lifetime of the programme. Third countries are welcome to participate in the Partnership. The initiative should promote the ambition towards more projects involving other partners than those in geographical proximity and the sufficient utilisation of the potential of the extended Eureka network.
Types and levels of contributions from partners
Proposals should mobilise the necessary financial resources from participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joints call for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
Member States are invited to maximise the financial support provided to innovative SMEs through increased national funding during the selection process.
International dimension
Proposals should focus on supporting international, projects led by innovative SMEs. They should enable international cooperation, enabling small businesses to learn, combine and share expertise and benefit from working beyond national borders.
In line with the ambitions of the partnership to foster international collaboration and the provisions of the model grant agreement, projects involving one legal entity established in a Member State or Associated Country as beneficiary and one legal entity established in a non-associated third country as partner may be supported in the same manner as under Eurostars 2. A substantial majority of the projects supported must involve at least two beneficiaries from Member States or Associated Countries.
Synergies
Focussing on helping innovative SMEs to grow and successfully embed in international markets and value chains by developing methodologies and technologies, the partnership is expected to collaborate closely with other relevant European Partnerships, missions and the European Innovation Council in order to ensure coherence and complementarity of activities. Proposals must describe the methodology for their collaboration and the aims the project wants to achieve with this kind of collaboration.
Proposals should include only their commitments for the grant covered by the present work programme.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in its work programmes 2023-2024 and 2025-2027 to award a grant to identified beneficiaries with the aim of continuing to provide support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.
Specific Topic Conditions:
The total indicative budget for the partnership is up to EUR 250 million.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
Structuring of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP) activities and consolidation of networks in the different technology areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025, focusing on non-power applications (cf. medical applications of ionising radiation and improvement of optimisation of protection in this domain);
Integration of the different energy roadmaps (nuclear and non-nuclear) by fostering collaboration between European Technology Platforms to address cross-sectorial challenges, including integration of NPPs in low-carbon and smart energy systems in order to complement the achievement of Horizon Europe’s objectives inter alia in the context of the energy transition;
Integration of SNETP in the Horizon Europe activities, with special emphasis on non-power applications, education and training. Cross-cutting actions to maximize the societal benefits of nuclear and radiation technologies should be identified;
Dissemination of the platform's activities to the policy-makers and stakeholders, including stakeholders beyond power generation;
Facilitating cooperation between projects across Europe in order to ensure the accessibility and reusability of produced data.
Scope:
SNETP is a European Technology Platform (ETP) that supports and promotes the safe, reliable and efficient operation of nuclear systems. Rapidly developing non-power applications of ionising radiation in health, agricultural, industrial and space sectors call for long-term efforts to reduce safety risks and support the development of safe nuclear technologies and optimal radiation protection.
In this context, SNETP should continue in 2021-2025 integrate research and innovation in nuclear safety at European level but also stimulate innovation in nuclear technologies going beyond their traditional areas of implementation as they can play a vital role in improving standards of living and health in European Union.
The Euratom funding will be devoted to specific studies, data collection, analysis and workshops for the further development of technology roadmaps, implementation plans and deployment strategies as well as to the dissemination of the platform activities to the various stakeholders. Due attention should be given to the integration of the different energy roadmaps (nuclear and non-nuclear). Activities should aim at fostering collaboration between ETPs to address cross-sectorial challenges between nuclear and non-nuclear energy sources with special emphasis on materials, digital including Artificial Intelligence, medical and other non-power applications of ionising radiation.
This action will support SNETP to structure its activities and orient them towards non-power applications. It will allow the consolidation of sustainable networks in the different technology areas covered by Euratom Research and Training Programme and enable cooperation with other ETPs and similar stakeholder’s fora. It will support reorientation of SNETP towards more interconnected activities with other sectors, in particular health, both in terms of contents and implementation mechanisms. In addition, it should help nuclear scientists to be closer integrated in relevant Horizon Europe actions (cf. Europe’s Beating Cancer Action Plan and Cancer Mission), and hence help disseminating the platform's activities to the policy-makers and stakeholders beyond power generation.
Proposal should include actions designed to facilitate cooperation with other projects across Europe, and to ensure the accessibility and reusability of data produced in the course of the projects. The proposal should also include a financial and sustainability plan for continuation of activities beyond the duration of the funded action. Secretariat and other running costs of SNETP are not eligible for funding under this action.
The indicative project duration is 3 years."

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
An improved and professionalised National Contact Points (NCPs) service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Euratom calls in nuclear research and training, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers and raising the average quality of proposals submitted;
A more consistent level of NCP support services across Europe by identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to the Programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that participate in the Programme;
Better links, improved cooperation and joint dissemination with other relevant networks and National Contact Points, such as those of the health and research Programmes.
Scope:
Support will be given to a consortium of National Contact Points (NCPs) in the research and training areas covered by the Euratom Programme. Proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to Programme applicants. The proposal should cover the whole duration of Programme.
The activities will be tailored to the nature of the area and the priorities of the NCPs concerned. Various mechanisms may be included, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to this field (including on the gender dimension of research and innovation) and twinning schemes. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.
Proposals should include a work package to implement matchmaking activities to link up potential participants with emerging consortia in nuclear research and training. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate.
While all Euratom NCPs officially appointed by the relevant national authorities can participate in this action, only NCPs from Euratom Member States and Associated Countries are eligible to receive funding. The consortium should have a balanced representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.
NCPs from Euratom Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project’s activities (e.g. information days, workshops or side conference events) with the participation costs (e.g. travel) incurred by the consortium."

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Detailed insight into the European human resources in the nuclear field – current needs, gaps and future perspectives, including Member States’ recent and planned actions – in terms of supply (academia) and demand (NPP and Research Reactors’ operators, suppliers, TSOs, regulators, medical and other non-power applications) for a workforce needing specialised knowledge and competences in nuclear and radiation technologies;
Enhanced Euratom competences through a higher number of nuclear careers, promoting the attractiveness of studies and jobs, via available education programmes and mobility opportunities including access to world-class infrastructures and job perspectives;
Enhanced nuclear competences in EU through support for nuclear careers, development of a coherent and sustainable Euratom vocational training programme based upon and extending available or planned courses and e-learning opportunities in some key domains, as well as platforms for practical work.
Scope:
In order to support the Euratom Programme’s objective of maintaining and enhancing the EU’s nuclear competences, the consortium would implement a comprehensive pan-European E&T programme in the areas related to the use of nuclear and ionising radiation technologies, including ionising radiation applications beyond nuclear energy. The action will consolidate the field of nuclear education and training in the EU by providing detailed insight, building upon previously developed activities e.g. the European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN) or the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology platform (SNETP) and its pillars, the European Learning Initiative in Nuclear Decommissioning and Environmental Remediation (ELINDER), DG ENER ENSTTI study (2016), or other strategies and frameworks under the European Education Area (EEA), European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and European Research Area (ERA) and designing a common approach at European level.
For the workforce needing specialised knowledge, skills and competence in this field (operators, TSOs, regulators, medical and other non-power applications), the action will provide a detailed analysis of national strategies and knowledge management programmes in terms of supply (academia) and demand (end-users) and how these strategies can be translated into educational and training programmes to ensure sufficient and skilled staff is available for the sector.
The action will further focus on attracting new talents by better promoting the existing European education programmes as well as by activities such as competitions, career events, summer camps, etc., targeting high school pupils, undergraduates and teachers.
Additionally, in order to tackle the fragmentation of the relevant nuclear training opportunities in the EU, the action will contribute to the development of a coherent and sustainable Euratom vocational training programme, using the Common Quality Assurance Framework (CQAF) for Vocational Education and Training (VET) and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for education. This will primarily be implemented in nuclear domains where there is a shortage of training offers or areas that would profit the most from international collaboration.
Complementing the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships accessible to nuclear researchers, a mobility scheme should be an integral part of the action in order to enable students’ and young researchers’ participation in the activities. In particular, it will facilitate access to E&T actions including access to learning facilities, as well as support participation in dedicated events (summer schools, workshops, conferences, etc.) and research and dissemination activities of Euratom projects as an important part of guided career development of highly specialised students and young professionals in multidisciplinary and multicultural environments. The mobility scheme should be extensive and sustainable and be equipped with sufficient funds.
The action should bring together teachers, academia, operators, regulators, teaching and training organisations, industrial and non-industrial suppliers, end users of nuclear and ionising radiation technology (in particular from power and non-power industry) and build on the experience and lessons learned of ongoing or completed projects.
In the context of the scope of this action, the Commission encourages international cooperation and mobility exchange beyond Euratom, particularly with international organisations (such as OECD/NEA NEST[1]) and institutions from third countries with the most advanced nuclear research programmes.
The action should build a long-term career perspective within the field while taking into account current job trends and evolutions. Human Resources specialists should be involved in this action.
Proposals could pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties in order to implement activities of this action.
Where appropriate, the Commission recommends consortia make use of the services of the JRC. The JRC may participate in the preparation and submission of the proposal. The JRC would bear the operational costs for its own staff and research infrastructure operational costs. The JRC facilities and expertise are listed in General Annex H of this Work Programme.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
Analysis of total costs of nuclear energy, taking into account the nuclear fuel cycle and NPP construction and decommissioning, as well as assessment of nuclear energy’s contribution to a climate-neutral EU energy system by 2050;
Analysis of the different dimensions of societal perception of nuclear energy and developing recommendations on stakeholder (including citizen’s views / civil society) engagement in the process of nuclear policy development and implementation;
Engagement with key stakeholders (civil society organisations and nuclear industry) on the challenges and solutions for public acceptance of nuclear technology practices through the European participatory workshops and the Local Information Committees linked to Nuclear Power Plants and other nuclear installations.
Scope:
Proposed action should examine the total costs of nuclear energy and make the comparison of costs for different energy technologies, taking into account the whole energy system, full lifecycle costs and sustainability criteria, i.e. internal and external costs.
The analysis of possible contribution of nuclear energy to EU climate neutrality by 2050 should consider all the options for how nuclear energy could contribute to meeting the climate target, while considering that some of the EU Member States do not share this view.
The analysis of the available and close to the market nuclear technologies should be performed, covering the full development cycle from research and development, to demonstration and early stage deployment (techno-economic evaluation). The analysis should cover options for the integration of reactor systems with the decarbonised energy system, covering also other energy needs than electricity generation and addressing energy supply to a wide range of sectors. Developing a technical and economic understanding of the role that different nuclear systems can play in an evolving low-carbon and low-emission market for some Member States will provide the insights for stakeholders for selection of proven technologies that can contribute to a cost-optimised energy system by 2050.
The action should also identify and assess societal, cultural and ethical dimensions of the use and development of nuclear technologies in different European countries and analyse how policies and practices in the nuclear field can be informed with insights on social and ethical factors affecting public perception of nuclear power. The recommendations for mechanisms of interaction between citizens, civil society, decision-makers and researchers (in particular in social sciences and humanities, SSH) should be developed. This would contribute to the understanding of factors triggering societal engagement and provide insights for stakeholders regarding interaction with civil society. Results of this action would also provide input to research how European citizens perceive the risks, benefits and potentials of advanced and innovative technologies.
Action should include a number of European participatory workshops and systematic interaction the Local Information Committees linked to Nuclear Power Plants and other nuclear installations. Such engagement with the key stakeholders (civil society organisations and nuclear industry) should allow for analysis of the challenges and possible solutions for public acceptance of nuclear technology practices."

This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
Research funders, policy-makers and the research community have established a consolidated research and innovation framework that provides the foundation of the expected future European partnership for pandemic preparedness, including the Partnership’s scope, objectives, governance and ways of working/operationalisation;
Research funders, policy-makers and the research community are aligned towards common objectives and have a common understanding of the long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for the Partnership, developed in consultation with future partners and relevant stakeholders;
Healthcare providers, European and international stakeholders engage with the appropriate partners through the research and innovation framework for the partnership
Scope:
The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a fragmented research landscape, with substantial room for efficiency gains in the development of the highly needed evidence to guide policy actions when facing an emergency. The expected future European partnership for pandemic preparedness should aim to improve the EU’s preparedness to predict and respond to emerging infectious health threats by better coordinating funding for research and innovation at EU, national (and regional) level towards common objectives and an agreed Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda.
Such a partnership should contribute to building a coherent European Research Area (ERA), enabling Member States, Associated Countries and the European Commission to rapidly and jointly support research and innovation in pandemic preparedness. Aligned around a multi-annual Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda with common objectives for research and innovation in pandemic preparedness, the prospective partners – in close collaboration with ECDC, EMA and other relevant actors – will define research needs in the medium- to long-term. The Partnership is expected to build on existing pandemic preparedness networks, and work in synergy with the future Health Emergency Response Authority (HERA)[1]. Collaboration with the private sector is anticipated.
The specifics of the European partnership for pandemic preparedness are being discussed with Member States and Associated Countries, and will be shared as they become available. It is anticipated that in its initial phase, the Partnership will primarily focus on epidemics/pandemics preparedness, although its scope may be revised to include further health threats that would be in scope of the activities of the future HERA. As relevant, the Partnership will apply a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary One Health approach.
Proposals should foresee the establishment of a secretariat to coordinate the creation the expected future European partnership for pandemic preparedness, with a strong involvement of public authorities (policy makers, research funders).
Proposals should include all of the following activities:
Perform the preparatory groundwork to inform an innovative and visionary Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for pandemic preparedness;
Actively engage with all prospective partners of the expected future Partnership to support alignment on its scope, common objectives, governance and ways of working/operationalisation;
Actively engage with relevant stakeholders and initiatives in the area of pandemic preparedness, ensuring collaboration and coordination, and avoiding duplication; e.g. GloPID-R, WHO R&D blueprint, ACT-Accelerator, etc.
Implement strong communication and dissemination activities on the purpose, foreseen activities and outputs of the expected future European partnership for pandemic preparedness, both outside and during epidemic/pandemic episodes.
Establish coordination and collaboration with relevant initiatives related to pandemic preparedness such as the future HERA to ensure complementarity and avoid overlaps.
As relevant, apply a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary One Health approach.
Communication activities at EU level and in Member States and Associated Countries to raise and maintain awareness of the importance of increased pandemic preparedness.
The proposal selected for funding is expected to engage with other relevant research and innovation initiatives, such as the expected future European partnerships on Transforming Health and Care Systems, One Health antimicrobial resistance, ERA for Health research and Animal Health and Welfare, or other relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe.

enhanced Euro-African cooperation in R&I on measurements for climate change observation.
Scope:
This topic aims at fostering EU-Africa cooperation to enhance climate (including Green House Gas and Short Lived Climate Forcers – GHG and SLCF) observation capacity across Africa. EU-Africa cooperation in the field of GHG observation will also include sharing of good practices and experiences to facilitate the development of a strategic approach for structuring R&I capacities at pan-African level. Particular attention should be given to tropical and sub-tropical Africa, which are currently the least covered regions in terms of climate observation. The participation of African partners is mandatory.
Proposals should address all following aspects:
establish a concept for a Pan-African climate observation RI including the underlying data infrastructure and the related digital transformation;; attention should be paid to open and FAIR principles in data management policies.
support the exchange of staff between several African countries and European research infrastructures to create expertise for the design, the governance and the operation of an integrated Pan-African RI for climate observation;
Proposals should build on existing cooperation activities between African and European countries and take into account the outcomes of previous and ongoing initiatives. The potential contribution to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) should be taken into account.
Proposals are encouraged to take advantage of Copernicus[1], its Data and Information Access Services (DIAS), the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) infrastructure, the European Commission Atmospheric Observatory for Greenhouse Gases[2] of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), as well as of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) observation systems and networks[3], or other existing data access solutions to optimise use of resources.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
National, regional and local authorities in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe are well prepared for the transition towards climate neutrality within cities by national capacity and knowledge building in close co-operation with the Preparatory action ‘Coordination of complementary actions for missions’.
Accelerated systemic transition to climate-neutrality for European cities by preparing local authorities to meet the overarching objectives of the European Green Deal[1] and the specific targets established by the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[2], the upcoming New EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change [3], the Renovation Wave for Europe Strategy[4], the European Climate Pact[5] and the 2030 Climate Target plan[6].
Enhanced synergies and common action points with the Urban Agenda for the EU[7] in the areas of better regulation, funding and knowledge through interactions with the Urban Agenda Thematic Partnerships [8] as well as the European Urban Initiative[9].
Identification of country-specific challenges and opportunities in terms of regulatory framework, funding and financing, urban morphology and governance structures promoting exchange of best-practices.
Enhanced synergies with R&I national/international communities and partnerships (such as the proposed ‘Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future’ Horizon Europe Partnership), including the City Science Initiative network promoting evidence-based policy making.
Define user requirements, while disseminate and promote the use of self-assessment toolkits and mappings adapted to national, regional and local challenges and opportunities.
Scope:
Cities are at the forefront of the transition towards greater sustainability. An increasing number of European cities are active pursuing the transition towards climate-neutrality, aligning with the objectives set by the European Green Deal Strategy. Furthermore, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, calls for having at least 100 climate neutral cities in Europe by 2030. The Communication on the European Climate Pact calls for a large engagement of all relevant actors to build a greener Europe and support the achievement of the Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development Goals[10], bringing together regions, local communities, civil society, industry, social partners and schools.
While willing to commit to start the path towards climate neutrality, cities are also being confronted with national, regional and local specificities, which create both challenges and opportunities. Member States and Associated countries are characterized by inherent diversities and needs when addressing legislations and regulations, funding and financing needs and opportunities, as well as geographical, climatic and socio-cultural peculiarities. The uniqueness of the European cities requires tailored national support, translating the European objectives into the local ambitions while keeping citizens needs at the core.
Specific national networks for these cities will support translating and tailoring the goals of the European Green Deal Strategy and all relevant initiatives launched within this framework to the local specificities in close collaboration with national and local authorities, stakeholders and citizens.
The proposal should:
In coordination with the ‘Missions Core Network’[11], support the set-up of dedicated national networks for supporting cities in their transition towards climate neutrality in the form of multi-stakeholders national platforms, promoting collaboration, cross-learning and training, exchange and replication of best practices between the European, national, regional and local level.
Mobilize and support a large number of urban authorities in engaging in climate-neutrality transitions in line with the overarching objectives of the European Green Deal, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, the upcoming New EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, the Renovation Wave for Europe Strategy, the European Climate Pact and 2030 Climate Target plan;
Disseminate and promote the use of supporting material for cities developed by the Direct Action grant Scientific and technical services by the Joint Research Centre – Mission on ‘Climate-neutral and smart cities’, included under Other Actions in Annex 12 of the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2021-2022 and other relevant initiatives (e.g. relevant material developed by the one-stop-shop to be established under the Horizon 2020 topic LC-GD-1-2-2020 on ‘Towards Climate-Neutral and Socially Innovative Cities’[12]).
Identify country-specific challenges, best-practices and opportunities concerning at least:
Regulatory Framework: including interaction between national, regional and local legislations/regulations relevant for the transition to climate neutrality at city level.
Funding and financing: through direct/indirect application of National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs)[13], Cohesion Policy Funds and Recovery and Resilience Facility provisions.
Urban morphology: through the mapping of geographical, climatic and socio-cultural contexts.
Governance structures: through analyses of citizens’ and stakeholders’ roles in decision-making processes, existing living labs and hubs for innovative participative governance.
In order to support cities in evidence-based policy making for climate-neutrality, such investigation could benefit from the experience of the Joint Research Centre and relevant initiatives as the Community of Practice on Cities[14] and the City Science Officers Initiative network [15]. The results should aim at supporting local authorities’ capacity building through dedicated activities such as: trainings, webinars and peer-exchange.
Applicants must take into account and assure that national hubs build on planned or ongoing national, regional or local activities aimed at achieving climate-neutrality in cities. The action should substantially raise the capacities and extend capabilities of existing national networks and hubs.

The action aims at contributing to the objectives and impacts as set-out in the mission introduction, specifically focusing on the renovation of urban spaces combining sustainability, accessibility and aesthetics in a human-centred way. The action will also provide the ground for reflecting the values and principles promoted by the New European Bauhaus initiative[1] into climate-neutral urban quality transformations, identifying co-creative governance models where citizens and stakeholders’ needs and expectations are at the centre. The New European Bauhaus was launched in the frame of the Renovation Wave for Europe Strategy[2] to act as design lab, accelerator and network at the same time to support the effort of making the Green Deal a cultural, human centred and positive, “tangible” experience.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
Accelerate the transition to full climate-neutrality for all European cities aligning with the objective of the European Green Deal, while contributing to the New European Bauhaus initiative;
Contribute to the objectives of the Renovation Wave for Europe Strategy, the upcoming New EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change [3], the European Climate Pact[4], the 2030 Climate Target plan[5], the Davos Declaration ‘Towards a European vision of high-quality Baukultur’[6] as well as of the objectives of having 100 climate neutral cities by 2030 as targeted by the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[7];
Increase awareness among local authorities and citizens on the New European Bauhaus [8] and the benefits of a climate-neutral urban transition as an opportunity to re-think and co-create qualitative, sustainable, inclusive and aesthetical urban spaces.
Support for local authorities and citizens’ in identifying emblematic projects to transform the quality, sustainability, inclusivity and aesthetics of public landscapes, building upon existing initiatives at national level.
Scope:
In order to contribute to the European Green Deal objectives of climate-neutrality, sustainability, prosperity and inclusiveness, cities will have to undergo a rapid and radical transformation and come up with creative, sustainable and collaborative solutions. Urban areas are characterized by diversity of resources, services, communities, interests and needs, which converge into public spaces design and management. A well co-designed public space provides the unique opportunity to improve its climate-neutrality (i.e. using bio-based and natural materials, nature based solutions, introducing new green spaces and circular economy concepts all across the construction life-cycle, new forms of work and commuting patterns, renewable energies, energy efficient lighting, smart digital services etc.) while increasing their attractiveness and social inclusiveness. As promoted by the New European Bauhaus initiative, a systemic co-designed approach to ‘quality climate-neutral urban transformation’ can create living space, where the best technical performances meet citizens’ social, emotional, cultural and aesthetic needs and values.
Proposals should include the following activities:
Developing innovative and collaborative models of local governance to engage with citizens and local stakeholders in order to identify urban emblematic projects that simultaneously address the three dimensions of sustainability (including circularity), quality of experience (including aesthetics) and inclusion (including accessibility and affordability).
Supporting cities in engaging with e.g. schools, universities, culture and arts professionals and institutions, citizens and civil society to harvest the needs, trends, challenges and expectations of citizens and communities in terms of quality climate-neutral urban transformation, in line with the New European Bauhaus initiative’s objectives and to start exploring how to match those needs with the existing possibilities.
Promoting the New European Bauhaus principles among national, regional and local authorities, citizens and stakeholders through dedicated local initiatives (i.e. events, contests, citizens’ dialogues, living labs) and the development of a dedicated platform for sharing of experience and good practices on participatory governance and co-design at local level.
The project should work in close co-operation with the Horizon Europe Preparatory action ‘Coordination of complementary actions for missions’ (HORIZON-MISS-2021-COOR-01) and with the one stop shop platform to be established under the Horizon 2020 topic LC-GD-1-2-2020 on ‘Towards Climate-Neutral and Socially Innovative Cities’[9] while embedding citizens social, emotional, cultural and aesthetic needs and values.
The project should as well work in close collaboration with other complementary support actions that will be established in the frame of the New European Bauhaus, such as the technical assistance[10] to be published indicatively in Q2 2021 under the European Regional Development and Cohesion Funds.

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For supported postdoctoral fellows
Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of MSCA postdoctoral fellows within academia and beyond;
New mind-sets and approaches to R&I work forged through interdisciplinary, inter-sectoral and international experience;
Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact.
For participating organisations
Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers;
Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;
Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation of the participating organisation(s);
Stronger R&I capacity and output among participating organisations; better transfer of knowledge;
Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating organisations.
Scope:
Fellowships will be provided to excellent researchers, undertaking international mobility either to or between EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries, as well as to non-associated Third Countries. Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.
Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:
European Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.
Global Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to European nationals or long-term residents[1] who wish to engage in R&I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025[1].
Secondments
Researchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.
For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.
For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to one third of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or any other organisation mentioned in the description of the action), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.
Placements in the non-academic sector
Postdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers seeking a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[3]. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[4]. The request for such a placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. It must be substantiated by a letter of commitment from the European non-academic organisation where the placement takes place[5]. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.
Training activities
The training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills[6], foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science) and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, etc.).
Career Development Plan
In order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.
Euratom
Aiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme 2021-2025[7] , are eligible to participate. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in this area of research will be supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025 through an indicative annual financial contribution of EUR 1 million to the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships call[8].
ERA Fellowships
The ERA Fellowships implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area, provide specific support to researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country[9]. This will help spread excellence and contribute to fostering balanced brain circulation in widening countries.

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
An improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon Europe calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted;
Harmonised and improved trans-national cooperation between NCPs;
More consistent level of NCP support services across Europe and beyond, notably in widening countries;
Increased participation of third-country NCPs in the activities of the action.
Scope:
The objective is to facilitate the trans-national co-operation between National Contact Points (NCPs) for the MSCA, including those established in Third Countries, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors and experiences.
Support will be given to a consortium of formally nominated MSCA NCPs. The activities will be tailor-made to the needs and priorities of the NCPs concerned and may include benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training sessions linked to the MSCA and wider R&I priorities and tools, twinning and mentoring schemes. Special attention will be given to enhancing the competence of MSCA NCPs, including helping newcomers and less experienced NCPs to rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated by their peers. Cooperation with other EU networks such as Euraxess Worldwide, Enterprise Europe Network, COST, will be encouraged to increase the visibility to potential beneficiaries, especially in the non-academic sector.
Addressing the R&I gap
There still is a research and innovation gap across Europe and discrepancies remain between European countries in their capacity to attract funding and researchers. This gap is observed in the MSCA as well. Particular emphasis on continuing the efforts to close this gap will mark the first years of the MSCA under Horizon Europe. Therefore, specific measures to support the NCPs in “widening countries,” such as training and mentorship schemes, should be organised to stimulate more high-quality applications with beneficiaries in these countries and increase their success rate in MSCA.
Attract researchers from third countries
The MSCA are the main EU instrument to attract researchers from Third Countries to Europe. Specific measures to encourage Third-Country NCPs to create contacts and participate in the activities of the project (e.g. training, twinning, mentoring, and other capacity building and networking activities) should be foreseen.
The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the MSCA and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network under “Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area”.
The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs and include NCPs from widening countries.
Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. NCPs choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops).
The expected duration of the action will be 36 months."

Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For researchers
Enhanced opportunities to interact with citizens and local, regional and national authorities;
Improved communication skills and competences to interact with a non-research audience, notably with pupils and students.
For organisations
Increased reputation and visibility of participating organisations in terms of hosting excellence research projects towards the general public and possible future students;
Researchers’ work made more tangible, concrete, accessible, and thus opening research and science to all;
Improved outreach to all audiences, and notably those who do not have an easy access to science and research activities;
Better communication of R&I results and activities to society, increased and strengthened opportunities for citizens’ engagement.
Scope:
The European Researchers' Night takes place every year, on the last Friday of September[1]. It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised.
It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers, in particular focused on young people and their families.
The European Researchers’ Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.
The European Researchers’ Night will also bring researchers to schools to interact with pupils at any time during the project duration. The Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers and pupils to interact on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.
Types of activities
Activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. This will be particularly relevant for Researchers at Schools activities, which will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Research and Innovation Missions. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place throughout the year and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools.
The European Researchers’ Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens’ daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.
Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes, notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.
The European Researchers’ Night promotes gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and researchers involved.
The European Commission has defined priorities, notably through the Horizon Europe Missions, which aim to tackle challenges faced by our societies.
For the 2022 call, applicants are encouraged to focus on, and include activities relating to, priorities identified by the Missions in their events.
Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps. Activities carried-out in non-associated third countries are not eligible for funding.
Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering two successive editions (2022 and 2023) of the European Researcher’s Night.
High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of associated events.
Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.
The expected EU contribution per project, mentioned in the indicative budget and specific conditions above, are for a single[2] annual edition of the European Researchers' Night.
[1]Except for countries which for strong cultural reasons would be prevented from organising any action addressing the public at large on such a date.
[2]The expected contribution for projects covering two editions of the European Researchers’ Night is between EUR 0.1 and 0.3 million, but this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal requesting different amounts."

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Structured evidence of scientific, societal and economic impacts of open science practice, complemented by the new methods, tools and data required to measure them.
Better knowledge on how impacts develop and how a diversity of benefits can be achieved at scientific, societal and economic levels.
Better understanding on how the practice of open science can contribute to the increased reproducibility of research results.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Prioritisation of policy actions for open science, and improved policy making on open science.
Maximised impact of open science.
Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and to set it as a modus operandi of modern science.
Scope:
Open science consists of sharing knowledge and data as early as possible in the research process, in open collaboration with all relevant actors, including citizens. The mainstreaming of open science practice[1] is driven by expected impacts: (i) on the research system, e.g. increased efficiency, better reliability, and better responsiveness towards societal challenges; (ii) on the innovation system, e.g. faster innovation when results are shared earlier, and innovations more directed towards societal challenges; (iii) on the interface between science and society, e.g. more productive interactions among academia and other knowledge actors, and higher trust of society in the science system when researchers and citizens are engaged. While past projects have started building an evidence base, this remains fragmented and incomplete. A broad and comprehensive evidence base would help define new policies for open science, drive further uptake and help communicate on open science.
Proposals are expected to:
systematise and evaluate the validity and robustness of existing literature, data and evidence of impacts of open science practice, including potential legal and licensing issues;
leverage and valorise the body of knowledge resulting from the Science and Society (FP6), Science in Society (FP7) and Science with and for Society (Horizon 2020) programmes;
complement existing evidence and develop scientific methodologies and models to capture impacts, notably those relating to socio-economic, including gender equality related, environmental and public health aspects. It is in particular expected to develop and implement methods for measuring the contribution of open science practice to the reproducibility of research results, and the implications of involving citizens, civil society and end-users in R&I;
perform cost/benefit analyses of open science practice and conduct research to identify by which causality/mechanisms the impacts develop.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
International Cooperation
Societal Engagement
[1]Open science practice includes: providing open access to research outputs (such as publications, data, software, models, algorithms, and workflows); early and open sharing of research (for example through preregistration, registered reports, pre-prints, crowd-sourcing of solutions to a specific problem); participation in open peer-review; measures to ensure reproducibility of results; and involving citizens, civil society and end-users in the co-creation of R&I agendas and content, including citizen science."

Projects are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
Strengthened international cooperation to increase and mainstream FAIRness[1] of data and digital objects.
Connection of disconnected initiatives on data management, data stewardship and FAIR data practices, across borders and disciplines, as enablers of open science.
Increased FAIR data sharing within and across scientific disciplines and innovation sectors.
These targeted outcomes in turn contribute to medium and long-term impacts:
Proliferation of interdisciplinary research that helps address societal challenges.
More efficient research practices as a result of an increased reproducibility of research and reduced duplication of efforts.
Better informed citizens and society about the results and value of research.
Improved quality of R&I within the EU.
Contributions to sustainable growth and faster innovation in Europe, and beyond, in the context of the global economy.
Scope:
Technological advancements have made science more data intensive and interconnected, with researchers producing and sharing increasing volumes of research data. To produce high quality research data, researchers have to follow good data management and data stewardship practices. Beyond proper data collection, annotation and archival, good data management and stewardship include long-term care of valuable digital assets, either alone or in combination with newly generated data. To maximise the value of science, research data should be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The FAIR principles, introduced in 2014, are a minimal set of community-agreed guiding principles that allow both machines and humans to find, access, interoperate and re-use research data. It is recognised that FAIR data play an essential role in the objectives of Open Science to improve and accelerate scientific research, to increase the engagement of society, and to contribute significantly to economic growth. Accordingly, the EU’s Open Science policy[2] contains the ambition to make FAIR data sharing the default for scientific research and this can be accelerated by focusing on specific scientific disciplines. Although the FAIR principles were initially applied to research data, their coverage extends to all digital objects that are essential to research practice (e.g. algorithms, models, tools, workflows), and to other public sector data. However, initiatives for good data management and stewardship practices and FAIR practice remain fragmented across borders and disciplines. In addition, interoperability remains the least developed to date. Interoperability standards, at discipline-level first, and then across disciplines, are an essential catalyst to foster interdisciplinary science to tackle the global societal challenges of our age. Finally, FAIR digital objects related to the research process are increasingly indispensable to ensure the reproducibility, integrity and re-use of data.
Proposals should support international cooperation on the FAIRness of both data & digital objects in a discipline-specific manner. Applicants should map current initiatives and best practices, globally, within a given scientific discipline, and should facilitate the exchange of best practices across disciplines. They should support case studies and pilots to implement both domain-specific and domain-independent recommendations in FAIR practice (from the Research Data Alliance –RDA-, the Committee on Data of the International Science Council -CODATA-, etc.). They should develop, pilot and possibly deploy interoperability standards and guidelines for increasing FAIRness in specific scientific disciplines, and across different disciplines. They should also develop assessment and evaluation methodologies to appraise FAIRness within disciplines and to develop domain-specific benchmarks.
To ensure complementarity of outcomes, proposals are expected to cooperate and align with activities of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Partnership and to coordinate with relevant initiatives and projects contributing to the development of EOSC. In particular, in areas such as data interoperability, metadata and vocabularies or the use of persistent identifiers, proposals should coordinate the work and establish a feedback mechanism with the awarded proposal(s) from the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-05 in order to ensure alignment with EOSC policies and to identify common useful tools and resources as well as relevant data repositories that comply with EOSC guidelines.
Proposals are also expected to engage and/or align where appropriate with projects funded under topics HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-03 and HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-04. Finally, if appropriate, proposals should further seek alignment with disciplinary use cases for FAIR as will be developed under topics HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-06, HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-07, and HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03.
Any prospective alignments should be clearly acknowledged in the proposals, which should foresee dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources for such activities.

Provide recommendations aiming at facilitating a clear career path for research managers at national and EU levels, enhancing their role towards the achievement of the new ERA objectives, including those addressed in the related Council Conclusions on the New European Research Area (13567/20).
Scope:
Research management can take many shapes: research policy advisers, research managers, financial support staff, data stewards, research infrastructure operators, knowledge transfer officers, business developers, knowledge brokers, innovation managers, etc. Entities and regions who are proven strong and excellent hubs in knowledge creation and innovation usually rely on a strong population of research managers.
This topic aims at improving training and skills development of research management staff, to develop better research and innovation management capacity and guidance for researchers across the entire ERA, as well as pave the way towards institutional acknowledgement of the research management profession.
Proposals are expected to map and analyse the EU landscape of research management and the financial framework to support it. They should address a wide scope of activities, such as trainings, study visits, staff exchange, internships, exchange of good practices, development of guidelines for new research managers and policy recommendations on how to deliver on research management under the new ERA.
It could include piloting a European network for research managers, including research infrastructures managers, through the integration of existing capabilities of Research Organisations, Higher Education Institutions and institutes, networks or umbrella organisations in research management. Projects are expected to generate a wide outreach to the European community of research managers, active across the ERA.
Proposals should explore the possibility to create new training paths dedicated to research support/management staff, or to optimise integration of existing recognised institutional training and certification programmes for research managers. Both these solutions should aim also at developing recommendations to strengthen existing schemes at EU level."

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) refer to next generation embedded ICT systems that are interconnected and collaborating including through the Internet of things, and providing citizens and businesses with a wide range of innovative applications and services. These are the ICT systems increasingly embedded in all types of artefacts making ""smarter"", more intelligent, more energy-efficient and more comfortable our transport systems, cars, factories, hospitals, offices, homes, cities and personal devices. Focus is on both reinforcing European industrial strengths as well as exploring new markets.
Often endowed with control, monitoring and data gathering functions, CPS need to comply with essential requirements like safety, privacy, security and near-zero power consumption as well as size, usability and adaptability constraints. To maximise impact and return on investment in this field, the following challenges must be addressed:
         De-verticalising technology solutions with CPS platforms that cut across the barriers between application sectors including mass consumer markets.
         Bringing together actors along the value chain from suppliers of components and customised computing systems to system integrators and end users.
         Creating new ICT Platforms for both vertical and core markets from automotive, health , smart buildings and energy to wireless communications and digital consumer products and services.
Scope: Activities should address the development of new paradigms, concepts, and platforms or toolboxes laying the foundation for future generations of CPS. Participants should include suppliers and users of CPS, tool providers, suppliers of sub-systems, system integrators, auditors/certification bodies of systems and related academia and research institutes (including Social Sciences and Humanities).
a.      Research & Innovation Actions should cover one or both of the following themes:
         Modelling and integration frameworks: modelling techniques and comprehensive integrated tool chains for clearly defined use cases. Major aspects to be addressed include the holistic modelling of the system behavioural, computational, physical and/or human aspects of CPS; and the seamless interoperability between CPS tools. Solutions should ensure flexibility and tractability of systems.
         Smart, cooperative and open CPS: Methods for engineering Cyber-physical Systems that are able to respond in real-time to dynamic and complex situations while preserving control, system safety, privacy, reliability, energy efficiency and dependability features, and addressing security and privacy ""by design"" across all levels. This includes CPS that are aware of the physical environment, enabling effective and fast feedback loops between actuation and sensing, possibly with cognitive and learning capabilities; further CPS with cooperation and negotiation capabilities supporting distributed services, autonomous, reactive and targeted problem solving and/or improved man-machine interaction. Also covered are open and heterogeneous CPS and Systems of Systems to facilitate seamless connectivity, dynamic reconfiguration as well as handling of emergent properties. The developed methods should enable evolutionary, adaptive and iterative system life-cycles and guarantee Quality of Service at functional and extra-functional level.
Projects are expected to be driven by industrial requirements, to be well balanced between industry and academia, and to include a demonstration and validation phase with realistic use cases.
b.      Innovation Actions will stimulate innovation and connect innovators across value chains in view of broader adoption of novel embedded and cyber-physical systems technologies and their enablers in industrial and societal applications. Proposals should cover one or both of the following themes.
         Towards platforms and ecosystems: Prepare reference architectures and platforms for open, smart and co-operative CPS applicable across sectors and application domains, including industrial consensus building, reference implementations, pre-normative activities, proof-of concept demonstration, user involvement and validation in key application domains. Proposals requesting a Small contribution are expected.
         Towards a ""smart everywhere"" society: Support will go to the establishment of European networks of embedded systems design centres. The networks' goal will be to help businesses from any sector uplift the quality and performance of their products and services with innovative embedded ICT components and systems. This will be done through a number of development and experimenting actions conducted with the help of the centres. Clustered in large scale projects and driven by user requirements, these experiments must facilitate users-suppliers partnerships across value chains and regions. With special emphasis on SMEs and mid-caps, focus is on technologies and processes, which are customised, integrated, tested and validated at the system level. The network must include vertical competences from embedded software and systems down to the components subsystems and components level and foster collaboration and trust, as well as openness and pre-normative measures. Work should build on and be complementary to EU, national and regional activities such as pilot projects in ENIAC, ARTEMIS and ECSEL.
Proposals requesting a Large contribution are expected. The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers running the experiments for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50.000 – 150.000 per party).  Maximum 50% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to this purpose.
 c.       Support Actions for cross-sectorial platform-building, structuring of constituencies and road-mapping, dissemination of programme achievements and impact analysis,   development of a strategic collaboration agenda for pre-competitive research on the foundations of modelling and simulation of CPS with the US, consensus building related to business models and non-technical societal and legal issues relevant to the wider diffusion of embedded and cyber-physical systems (e.g. human behaviour, social aspects, liability, security and privacy).
Expected impact:
         Reduction of development time for CPS by 30% as compared to the state-of-the-art in 2013 and significant reduction in maintenance costs.
         Stronger pan-European collaboration across value chains and technology levels from the components and hardware to higher systems level creating open innovation eco-systems and stimulating consensus building on open tools, platforms and standards.
         Development in Europe of a competitive offer for next generation core ICT platforms spanning from operating systems and middle ware to application development and deployment tools with built-in security. This should translate into a significant increase of Europe's market share in this area and in higher added value generated from embedded ICT.
         Uplifting Europe's innovation capacity and competitiveness across all economic sectors with the wider adoption of networked embedded ICT, notably in SMEs.
Types of action:
a.       Research & Innovation Actions – A mix of proposals requesting Small and Large contributions is expected
b.      Innovation Actions – A mix of proposals requesting Small and Large contributions is expected

","single-stage
Deadline date","ExpectedOutcome:
This action builds on the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2021 action (HORIZON-MSCA-PF-2021). The target group are host organisations located in Widening Countries.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:
For supported ERA Fellows:
Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of fellows within academia and beyond;
New mind-sets and approaches to R&I work forged through interdisciplinary, inter-sectoral and international experience;
Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact;
For participating organisations in the Widening Countries:
Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers;
Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;
Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation of the participating organisation(s);
Stronger R&I capacity and output among participating organisations; better transfer of knowledge;
Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating organisations.
For Widening countries:
Increased attractiveness for researchers to entities in widening countries, by providing competitive grants and spreading attractive working and employment practices;
More postdoctoral researchers attracted to widening countries.
Scope:
Fellowships should be provided to excellent researchers[1], undertaking cross-border mobility either to or between EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries. Applications are expected to be made jointly by the researcher together with a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector located in a Widening Country.
ERA Fellowships should take place in a Widening Country. Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe to a Widening Country.
In order to apply for the ERA Fellowships call, applicants need to submit their proposal to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships 2021[2]. To be eligible to this call the host organisation must be located in an eligible widening country. The application to the (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships 2021 will be automatically resubmitted to this call in case the proposal fails to reach an adequate place in the ranking to be funded. This simplified submission procedure to the ERA Fellowships call presents applicants moving to Widening countries with an additional funding opportunity but there is the possibility to opt out during the application stage.
The proposals submitted under the ERA Fellowships must fulfil all the admissibility and eligibility conditions of the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2021 and pass all the thresholds for that call.
ERA Fellowships will be implemented applying the award criteria, scoring and threshold for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. The ranking order for the ERA Fellowships call will follow the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2021 call scores and evaluation procedure and proposals will also retain the scores and comments included in the Evaluation Summary Report (ESR) of this call. The MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2021 model grant agreement will be used to the ERA Fellowships.
Secondments
Researchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.
Placements in the non-academic sector
ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers seeking a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. It must be substantiated by a Letter of Commitment from the European non-academic organisation hosting the secondment[3]. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.
Training activities
The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills[4], foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science) and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to research data, FAIR data management, etc.).
Career Development Plan
In order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan has to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.
Specific Topic Conditions:
The expected EU contribution depends on the number of person-months requested. For the applicable unit contributions, see specific conditions for the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships at the end of the MSCA Work Programme part.

The importance of the areas of the often time- and safety-critical embedded and cyber-physical systems (CPS) will continue to grow with the increasing pervasiveness of ICT and the development of the Internet of Things. The challenge is to design, programme and implement highly distributed and connected digital technologies that are embedded in a multitude of increasingly autonomous physical systems with various dynamics and satisfying multiple critical constraints including safety, security, power efficiency, high performance, size and cost. Such combination of several cyber-physical systems in ""system of systems"" gives rise to unpredictable behaviour and emergent properties. A significant improvement in design and programming of CPS is therefore needed including a ""science of system integration"".
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions - Science of system integration: Research and Innovation projects should address new model-centric and predictive engineering methods and tools for cyber-physical systems and systems of systems with a high degree of autonomy ensuring adaptability, scalability, complexity management, security and safety, and providing trust to humans in the loop. Work should be driven by industrial needs and validated in at least two use cases complementing each other in different application domains and sectors. Results should be integrated into broader development environments and middleware. The centre of gravity of the work should be on TRLs 1-4, with demonstrations up to level 5.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Coordination and Support Actions for structuring of constituencies, strategically updating and validating CPS roadmaps, cooperating with other European programmes such as ECSEL and ITEA on the foundations of CPS engineering, promoting platform building and pre-normative activities (such as a repository of CPS technology blocks) and consensus-building on societal and legal issues related to the deployment of CPS.
Proposals are expected to bring together leading CPS experts from academia and industry to collaborate on future CPS architectures and platforms.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 1 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address one or more of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success when appropriate.
Extension of, and/or performance improvement in the supply of CPS methods and tools targeting specific industrial markets;
Demonstrable advances in CPS engineering to reduce significantly development time and cost of ownership;
Contribution to interoperability activities (e.g. repositories of models, interface specifications or reference architectures/platforms/patterns)."

Flexible and Wearable Electronics combines new and traditional materials with large-area processes to fabricate lightweight, flexible, printed and multi-functional electronic products. The challenge is to tap open opportunities in existing and emerging markets by pushing technology barriers further and demonstrating innovative use in sectors that could benefit from such innovations.
Scope:
To fully exploit the potential of Flexible and Wearable Electronics and overcome barriers of manufacturability, challenges need to be addressed in materials, processes for large-area fabrication and quality control, integration technologies, and demonstrating innovative and sustainable products for professionals and consumers. This topic will support advances in device technology and related manufacturing processes.
Proposals can address one or more of the following topics:
Enhancing manufacturability: Addressing advances in combined organic and printed electronics and large area deposition technologies resulting in multi-functional components; and/or equipment and processes for large-scale fabrication, mass-customisation and characterisation as well as textile compatibility, whenever relevant.
Integration technologies: It addresses the development of new concepts for the integration of transducers, energy and data storage elements, logic, displays and light sources, as well as new interconnection technologies.
Device demonstration: Prototype validation in specific applications of flexible and wearable electronics. Consideration to be given to the integration of electronic devices in connected wearable and portable settings (e.g. textiles, flexible or stretchable substrates), interconnection, compatibility with low-cost manufacturing, efficient energy scavenging and storage, functional performance, and durability/reliability. Privacy and security, liability and free flow of data as well as recyclability and waste management should be considered where relevant.
It is expected that projects addressing manufacturability would demonstrate production capability in a laboratory environment (TRL 4).
For integration and device demonstration, it is expected that technologies are validated in laboratory or relevant environments (TRL 4-5), and that industrial exploitation is clearly identified.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
To complete this effort and strengthen the value chain, from materials to devices, a jointly funded topic with NMBP[1] will support projects spanning from material improvement (electrical performance, processibility, stability and lifetime during device operation), to prototyping of advanced large area electronic products - TRL 3 to TRL 5. This topic will be implemented through Innovation Actions (see topic DT-NMBP-18-2019 Materials, manufacturing processes and devices for organic and large area electronics (IA)).
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address some of the following impact criteria and provide metrics to measure and monitor progress:
Technology leaps related to improved performance (functionalities, autonomy, reliability, manufacturability and cost…) and contributing to European leadership in large area, flexible and wearable electronics .
The emergence of new products based on the combination of printed and large area processed electronics.
Increased R&D cooperation in technology device development and related manufacturing processes.
Developing further manufacturing capabilities in Europe.
Creating new opportunities for digitisation in other sectors and including new actors in the ecosystems (designers, artists…),
Increased industrial investments in flexible and wearable electronics.

Specific Challenge: TOLAE is an emerging technology and is the basis for advanced products in large area electronics that are thin, light weight, flexible and/or stretchable, suitable for large market sectors such as the textile, automotive, health, paper, plastic, advertising or construction industries.
Today however, most of the existing products are limited in functionality and performance and are suitable only to a few niche markets. Further efforts are needed to address the main technology barriers of TOLAE, in particular the lack of more efficient and stable materials and of more complex TOLAE circuitry and functionalities. The performance of components and the integration level should also be increased, connectivity should be enhanced and the route to manufacturability improved in terms of reproducibility and yield.  Overall, the TOLAE value chain needs to be further developed and become more application-driven while paying attention to recyclability issues.

The challenge is to be able to develop and manufacture smart objects and systems that closely integrate sensors, actuators, innovative MEMS, processing power, embedded memory and communication capabilities, all optimising the use of supply power. This will require technology breakthroughs notably in integration, miniaturisation with additional functionalities and mastering complexity. This will result in highly reliable, resilient and resource efficient digital and heterogeneous smart objects and systems that could easily be made interoperable within systems of systems. As dependency on these smart objects and systems increases, reliability and security will become critical differentiating factors as well as low power consumption, energy harvesting and the capability to operate under various and harsh conditions.

Thin, Organic and Large Area Electronics (TOLAE) is an emerging technology with high growth potential, well suited for applications that need large area and/or flexibility or stretchability. To be able to fully benefit from the opportunities brought by this technology and widen the scope of its applications, improvements are sought on features such as reliability, manufacturability and performance. The main challenge is to develop and also demonstrate prototypes of innovative TOLAE-enabled solutions with the above characteristics. This can be addressed in two complementing ways, hybrid integration bringing new opportunities for traditional electronics on flexible substrates and improving readiness of TOLAE technologies for use in dedicated applications.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions
Advancing the readiness of TOLAE technologies and/or hybrid integration for use in applications.
Actions will address the development of advanced materials, technologies and scalable manufacturing processes (ranging from vacuum deposition to printing under ambient conditions) and/or the hybrid integration of micro/nano-electronics (including thin silicon) and photonics components. Focus is on conformable, flexible or stretchable substrates (such as paper, plastic, metal foil, glass or textile). The goal is to have reliable TOLAE-enabled devices with more functionality, better performance and longer lifetime that are ready for use in applications with high growth or high volume potential.
Actions may include related work on design and modelling tools in particular addressing variability issues in printing, interfacing of hybrid integration and reliability. Work could also address specific needs for textile electronics.
Actions should demonstrate strong industrial and user commitment, be driven by user requirements and include validation of the results for the chosen applications. They should include standardisation and address the value chain, as appropriate.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Innovation Actions
Proposals should cover one or both of the following themes:
Set-up and validation of pilot line for Hybrid Systems
The objective of the pilot line is to provide design and development services in particular for SMEs. Focus is on manufacturing of Hybrid Systems where conventional micro-/nano-electronics and photonic components are integrated on flexible substrates. The action should be driven by stakeholders able to set-up and run the pilot line. Proposals should describe the business cases and exploitation strategy for the industrialisation of the pilot line and the pilot line should be open access by offering services to external users under fair conditions. There should be a strong commitment to manufacturing in Europe. The pilot line could make use of existing (research or industrial) pilot lines.

Today the net is a place unlocking rapid innovation. This potential is too often left un-exploited, i.e. Europe does not do enough to turn RTD & I outcomes into business success. In particular open platforms offer opportunities for the development of new services and applications. FIWARE, for example, is an open platform that demonstrates the capacity to become a preferred service platform, but its potential is currently underused.
Current centralised platforms for big and social data management consolidate the dominance of existing incumbent actors, stifling innovation and allowing less and less control over the data by citizens. Distributed architectures and decentralised platforms have a huge potential to enable the creation of viable alternatives to current dominant models.
More generally, key players and ecosystems, startups and SMEs often do not have sufficiently innovative technology in their hands to innovate on the net. Outcomes of Future Internet RTD & I need to be transferred faster into real life.
Scope:
a. Innovation Actions
Multi-vendor Open Service Platforms will allow increased competition and avoid vendor lock-in. They should have royalty-free open specifications, open source reference implementations, and be offered by multiple vendors. The Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technology Development (FP7) has developed the FIWARE platform which has demonstrated its potential of becoming a service platform of choice, as well as other research results with a lot of potential for usage by SMEs and startups. For such potential to be realised, the following three innovation activities are needed. In addition, a fourth activity develops applications and services on top of any Future Internet research results.
Among lead sectors, smart cities have emerged as a viable vector for FIWARE adoption. The activities will focus on the take-up of FIWARE in cities and the evolution of the FIWARE platform with new context-aware services addressing the needs of cities.
The ecosystem creation consists of building and supporting an open community of FIWARE innovators and users. A professional online and open engagement strategy may include hackathons and challenges, building community programmes for startups and SMEs and link to related national and regional programmes. Activities will incentivise entrepreneurs and users to explore FIWARE, by building on previous community achievements and contributing to an evolving ecosystem.
FIWARE sustainability and evolution will be supported by the further evolution of the service platform by an open community. Activities include supporting the execution of a roadmap with a full set of supported enablers, with a reference implementation in open source, maintained and made available to third parties for use, with high quality and clear terms and conditions. Furthermore, a public sandbox environment for experimentation of all supported enablers by any third party interested is made available. Activities contribute to building an open source community to manage the integrity and evolution of the FIWARE technology, and to ensure a real multi-vendor approach.
Future Internet research results will be transferred into innovation via acceleration activities. They will support SMEs and startups taking research results of completed or ongoing projects in the domain of Future Internet and develop applications and services on top of these research results in order to achieve concrete business and market take-up. The action will involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the process of selecting SMEs and startups for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 25 000-75 000[1]). At least 60% of the EU funding should be allocated to financial support for these third parties. However, the selected SME and startups ideally bring additional resources, i.e. additional private and/or public funds. Any IPR generated by the SMEs and startups shall rest with them[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per innovation activity will be selected.
b. Research and Innovation Actions
Distributed architectures for decentralized data governance aims at demonstrating a distributed open hardware and software platform (for communications, cloud computing or Internet of Things) capable of supporting decentralised data and identity management and bottom-up participatory innovation.
The goal is to provide SMEs, social enterprises, industries, researchers, communities and individuals with a new development platform, which is intrinsically protective of the digital sovereignty of European citizens. The key characteristic of such a platform is to be fully distributed (e.g. using decentralised algorithms based on blockchains), in order to be more resilient, intrinsically resistant to malware and hacking, preventing any possible centralisation of data storage or data management, and able to provide federated identity management.
Proposals are expected to design, develop and demonstrate an architecture for such a platform, with the involvement of relevant technological actors (P2P and open source developers, open hardware manufacturers, experts in security, encryption, anonymity, blockchains and linked data) as well as of civil society organisations (citizens' organisations, digital rights advocacies, artists, social scientists) and interested developers of the overlying social applications and systems (creative industries, SMEs, social entrepreneurs, software developers).
A strong focus is expected on the creation of robust open standards for such distributed and decentralised architectures, in coordination with industry and academia.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
c. Coordination and Support Actions.
Support for collaboration and networking in the domain of Future Internet including the organisation of the Net Futures conference.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 0.2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address one or more of the following impact criteria, providing metrics to measure success when appropriate:
a. Innovation Actions: Open Service Platform
The outcomes of the Future Internet PPP are handed over to an open, multi-stakeholder community to ensure the evolution of FIWARE and its take-up among industry, small business and notably establishing FIWARE as the open service platform of choice for cities. This will allow them to develop and integrate smart cities applications more easily and faster, but also to achieve economies of scale through easy sharing of applications between cities;
Increased take-up of Future Internet technologies by SMEs and web entrepreneurs;
Significant increase of the effectiveness of business processes and applications of high economic and/or societal value.
b. Research and Innovation Actions: Distributed architectures
To demonstrate how a distributed architecture can enable new data services and disruptive (e.g. commons-based) economic models, and become a viable decentralised alternative to the current dominant data management platforms which are gathering big data at global scale in a centralised manner;
To demonstrate that citizens' generated data can be made available as part of a common distributed and decentralised architecture, open to all, so to allow new entrants to aggregate data on demand, bringing unanticipated features and innovative services;
To develop an architecture and open standards allowing European citizens to retain full control over their digital identities, and to move their personal profiles between different platforms, for distributed or centralised (data portability);
To create a level playing field for the development of new collaborative applications and services based on emerging participatory innovation models that are intrinsically respectful of privacy and ethics.
c. Coordination and Support Actions
Increased multi-disciplinary collaboration among Future Internet communities.
[1]In line with Article 23 (7) of the Rules for Participation the amounts referred to in Article 137 of the Financial Regulation may be exceeded, and if this is the case proposals should explain why this is necessary to achieve the objectives of the action.
[2]It is recommended to also use established networks reaching out to SMEs like the Enterprise Europe Network and the NCP network for calls publications and awareness raising towards SME's."

Specific Challenge:
The challenge is to create an environment in Europe that encourages more web entrepreneurs to start a business in Europe and grow internationally. The focus of this topic is on entrepreneurs who use web and mobile technologies as main components in their innovation.
Scope:
a.      Accelerate web entrepreneurship in Europe: Online platforms with new services
Proposals to develop and test online platforms connecting existing local web entrepreneurship ecosystems and hubs, and build upon these in order to provide new services for web entrepreneurs, complemented with other relevant activities. These platforms are expected to go beyond technologies and applications, to include necessary conditions for collaborative innovation.
The new services should help promising web startups to efficiently launch and scale up their operations across Europe, to create exposure to new financing opportunities, to link potential web entrepreneurs with key actors, e.g. mentors, located anywhere in Europe and to link acceleration programmes from several locations - providing real EU added value.
Characteristics of the proposed action can include as part of their services initiatives such as ""geeks in-residence"" to help web startups accelerate in their technological developments. They should be open to include any other measures, local, national or European, which aim to support web entrepreneurs in the launch, growth and internationalisation of their businesses.
Proposals may include actions to highlight the most valuable initiatives in a European context, e.g. highly-visible and innovative web and mobile services and applications.
b.      Coordination activities in the area of web entrepreneurs
Support actions that strengthen the environment for web entrepreneurship in Europe and that exploit synergies across stakeholder communities. They aim at increasing the impact, accessibility and reach of the online support platforms and the new services they offer as well as link into other relevant initiatives. This action should as well cover actions beyond the technological, e.g. training, legal and financial aspects.
Therefore proposals may also include features such as networking all relevant stakeholders groups; encouraging people, notably the young and the women, to become web entrepreneurs; supporting  European initiatives on web entrepreneurship; supporting awards to celebrate web entrepreneurship; promoting the use of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) for web entrepreneurship skills.
Expected impact:
         To support the emergence of dynamic European ecosystems for web entrepreneurs that also contribute to shaping future web entrepreneurship specific policies, in particular for the implementation of Startup Europe EU initiative[1].
         To provide new, innovative environments including services that will help web entrepreneurs in their process of starting up and scaling up their start-ups.
         A European environment, fora and stakeholders, for web entrepreneurs to reflect and share experiences, easily replicate successful example, consider failures as valuable experience and where web start-ups can be confident in getting support.
         To contribute, together with other relevant initiatives of the Commission, to a positive impact across the continuum of actors for entrepreneurship.

","20 October 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The validation of research results in large-scale, real life experimental infrastructures is essential for the design and deployment of products, applications and services on the Future Internet. Europe needs a Federated Experimental Infrastructure for Future Internet Research & Experimentation (FIRE+) available to experiments of any size, complexity, or networking technology. Experimenters need to run experiments under controlled and replicable conditions, according to specific requirements by accessing real or virtual equipment, services, systems and tools on demand, seamlessly and regardless of their geographical location.
A dynamic and promising segment of experimenters, in particular small and medium-size developers and innovators cannot afford testbeds or even testing equipment of their own and need to be provided easy and affordable access to said capacities. Real-world prototyping and experimenting environments are needed in certain cases for innovation creation. In addition, Future Internet Research and Experimentation in Europe could benefit from similar initiatives around the world.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions
Proposals should cover one of the following bullet points:
Proposals for at least one very large collaborative project that would i) build upon the federation efforts already undertaken, including the development of relevant federation tools and concepts like Experimentation-as-a-Service (EaaS); ii) develop a sustainability and evaluation framework for selecting testbeds for federation iii) continue federating the experimental testbeds under FIRE+, including testbeds (national, regional or local) selected using the above sustainability and evaluation framework, for the benefit of experimenters; iv) broker between facilities and experimenters, including in particular SMEs allowing experimenters to access the facilities for experimentation; v) pursue the efforts of federation in a global context, in particular with US, Japan, Brazil and South Korea, with the aim of exchanging best practices, tools and methodologies.
Proposals for at least one large collaborative project in each of the following three areas, for the creation, reconfiguration and/or extension of experimental infrastructures: i) large-scale experimentation on management and control of cognitive radio, including in terms of compliance, as well as dynamic spectrum sharing in licensed and unlicensed bands, addressing also new spectrum bands; ii) large-scale experimentation for service delivery networks, based on heterogeneous and cooperative networks integrated through SDN/NFV techniques and compatible with demanding high mobility environments, e.g. connected vehicles ; iii) large-scale experimentation on Future Multimedia Internet (FMI) services fully integrated with broadcasting, with a focus on high mobility scenarios and its impact on communication and storage infrastructures.
The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of proposed actions must be between 3 (experimental proof of concept) and 7 (system prototype demonstration in operational environment). Actions should contribute to pre-standardisation and standardisation on their respective technologies in collaboration with bodies and fora, such as ETSI, W3C and IETF.
Actions will involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of third parties for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 50 000 – 150 000[1] per party). At least 50% of the EU funding should be allocated to experimentation-related financial support to third parties, while an additional 20% could be allocated to the brokering between facilities and experimenters. Lower percentages can be accepted, if justified, especially in the case of creation of new experimental facilities.[2]
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million for the first bullet point and up to EUR 5 million for the second bullet point would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b. Coordination and Support Actions:
Proposals should cover one or both of the following bullet points:
Identification, evaluation and roadmap of the future needs for Future Internet large-scale experimentation; analysis and development of collaboration models, capabilities and resources; vision and strategy for FIRE+;
Communication, community building, impact and effectiveness stimulation and dissemination of FIRE+ results; performance monitoring and performance indicators.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million and covering the two bullet points would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals should address the following and provide appropriate metrics for measuring success:
Experimental capability at European level that covers a variety of networking technology areas and allows tens of experiments to be run on top of them each year;
Potential to experiment without the constraints of the physical location or access to a specific experimental facility;
Reduction of the time to experiment by allowing a larger set of experiments to take place on reliable and benchmarked infrastructure that can evolve and be re-configured;
Response to the needs of individual, small and medium experimenters without access to experimental facilities or environments;
Support of trials driven by vertical application areas with a good mix of supply and demand stakeholders;
Contribution to the sustainability model of experimental facilities;
Contribution to standardisation and interoperability of experimental facilities;
Concrete cooperation and cross-fertilisation between European and international initiatives in experimentally-driven research as a first step towards a wider collaboration with US, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.
Cross-cutting Priorities:
International cooperation

The newly created Big Data Value contractual public-private partnership (cPPP) needs strong operational support for community outreach, coordination and consolidation, as well as widely recognised benchmarks and performance evaluation schemes to avoid fragmentation or overlaps, and to allow measuring progress in (Big) Data challenges by solid methodology, especially in emerging areas where the significance of Big Data is rapidly increasing. Also, there is an urgent need to improve the education, professional training and career dynamics (including addressing the existing gender gaps in ICT) so that the profiles of data professionals better respond to the rapidly evolving needs of data intensive industry sectors.
Scope:
a. One Coordination and Support Action (CSA) will perform all of the following tasks:
support the community building, the administration and governance of the cPPP, in close collaboration with the cPPP governance bodies; facilitate discussion on relevant topics such as the framework conditions of the data economy; organise events and contribute to synergies and coordination between the actors and stakeholders of the cPPP and beyond;
liaise with and build on related actions[1] and support the establishment of national centres of excellence in all Member states, and exchange knowledge on the universities' data scientist programmes across all Member States; to align curricula and training programmes to industry needs; to stimulate and promote (among the organisations participating in the Big Data PPP actions) exchanges of students, confirmed data professionals and domain experts that would acquire data skills and let them work on a specific Big Data challenge/project in a company or a research centre/university in another Member State.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. No more than one action will be funded.
b. Research and Innovation Actions
The benchmarking action will identify specific data management and analytics technologies of European significance, define benchmarks and organise evaluations that allow following their certifiable progress on performance parameters (including energy efficiency) of industrial significance. The benchmarking and evaluation schemes will liaise closely with data experimentation/integration (ICT-14) and Large Scale Pilot (ICT-15) projects to reach out to key industrial communities, to ensure that benchmarking responds to their real needs and problems, and to provide a basis for measuring the success of the PPP. The ""European significance"" of industry/technology sectors should be determined and documented by objective criteria such as turnover, world-wide market share and growth rates of the European companies who provide or use such technologies. When real datasets cannot be made available for benchmarking, synthetic datasets will be acceptable, provided that they are produced by models that certifiably produce data distributions approximating real datasets in all respects that are industrially relevant. The action shall address areas of activity that do not yet have a benchmarking/evaluation scheme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","31 October 2017
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The challenges consist in providing an end to end facility that can i) demonstrate that the key 5G PPP network KPIs can be met; ii) be validated and accessed and used by vertical industries to set up research trials of innovative use cases, to further validate core 5G KPIs in the context of concurrent usages by multiple users.
Scope:
The target 5G end to end network facility covers[1] fixed/multi radio access, backhaul, core network, service technologies and architectures targeted for 5G including end to end virtualisation and slicing as key component to support vertical use cases.
The objective is i) to validate the 5G network KPIs through representative network trials, as defined by the 5G PPP; ii) to prepare an extensive validation platform for verticals use cases. The facility allows to validate early versions of the standards and to prepare for later ""forward compatible"" versions. Such facility may be based on the interworking of several experimental platforms existing in Europe. It requires availability of an openness framework (both legal and technical, e.g. open APIs) enabling ""vertical"" projects to access and use it. It also requires a methodology to consistently compare technologies where appropriate.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 and 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
- Demonstrated feasibility of 5G PPP KPIs[2] beyond 4G evolution (NB-IoT, 4G LTE-A-PRO), including at least KPIs for capacity, ubiquity, speed, latency, reliability, density of users, location accuracy, energy efficiency, service creation time, network management capex/opex. It requires clear analysis of the state of the art and how 5G goes beyond.
- Demonstration of innovative radio spectrum use and sharing applicable to 5G spectrum use, including - if appropriate - licensed, unlicensed or licensed-shared access.
- Validation of a representative end to end 5G architecture including end to end service provisioning with slicing capabilities and solving slicing issues between core and access.
- Demonstrated impactful contribution to standards. Participation of key European industrial partners with high standardisation impact is desired.
- Availability of 5G facility that may be further used for validation through specific vertical use cases and/or for large scale showcasing events.

SMEs represent 85% of all actors in the creative industry sector. They co-exist with global players and often face difficulties in adopting state of the art ICT technologies and accessing finance. Moreover, they operate on fragmented and localised target markets and have to bear high market costs which affect their international competitiveness. In this context, ICT tools and technological innovation are fundamental for the creative industries and their competitiveness. They widen creative possibilities and improve efficiency in all sectors.
The goal is to increase the competitiveness of the European creative industries by stimulating ICT innovation in SMEs, by effectively building up and expanding a vibrant EU technological ecosystem for the creative industries' needs and by fostering exchanges between the creative industries SMEs and providers of innovative ICT solutions.
Scope:
Innovation Actions
Actions should support creative industries SMEs in leveraging emerging ICT technologies for the development of innovative products, tools, applications and services with high commercial potential. Proposals should ensure that creative industries SMEs are participants in the consortium and take on a driving role in the action, i.e. leading the innovation activities and liaising with end-users, ensuring that the work responds to a clear market demand. The draft business plan provided should demonstrate that the solutions are cost-effective, market-ready and targeted at existing markets with a potential for cross-border extension.
Proposals should make clear if the action would lead to impacts at European or international level and explain how the achievement of those impacts would be measured.

The next phase of 5G activities running during the 2018-20 period is expected to cover, both in EU and in China, technologies and systems demonstrations and trials. The challenge is hence to demonstrate technologies and system interoperability for a number of core applications of interest in the two regions.
Scope:
The scope is to conduct 5G trials addressing two specific scenarios: scenario n°1 - enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) on the 3.5GHz band, which is a priority band in the two regions for early introduction of very high rate services; and scenario n°2 - Internet of Vehicles (IoV) based on LTE-V2X using the 5.9 GHz band for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and the 3.5 GHz band for Vehicle-to-Network (V2N). The overall goal is to evaluate in real setup innovative end-to-end 5G systems built on the outcomes of the previous phases of the 5G R&I. More specifically, the optimisation of the band usage in multiple scenarios with different coverage is a key target, so as the validation of the geographic interoperability of the 3.5 and 5.9 GHz bands for these use cases. Both scenarios shall be implemented in both regions (EU and China) through testbeds with interoperability forming the core of the R&I work.
The underlying trials' testing facilities shall implement the latest mature and broadly commonly agreed 5G systems, network architectures and technologies spanning from the core/transport networks, the radio access, up to the service, orchestration, management and security components. The trial facility shall not be restricted to innovative 5G radio access technology, but should include and enable the evolution of 5G networks innovations in network slicing, virtualisation, cross-domain orchestration, in view of supporting resource control from multiple tenants. In EU, trials are preferably implemented over the 5G end-to-end platforms developed under ICT–17-2018.
The 5G trials' infrastructures shall facilitate the testing and validation of innovative applications for each of the defined scenarios, including efficiency solutions in the areas of spectrum usage, energy consumption and costs.
As per cPPP objectives, relevant industries and organisations are expected to have a sizeable share of the proposals participation. Teams including mobile operators, vendors (for both scenarios) and car companies (for scenario n°2 IoV) together with SMEs, academia and research institutes may be considered.
Proposals shall foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by China to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies. This topic is calling for bilateral project twinning with the National Science and Technology Major Project (NSTMP) ""mirror project"" launched by China in 2018. Proposals shall foresee all the mechanisms, including budget provisions, to enable close collaboration with the ""5G Major Project"" that will be funded by China. The two twining projects (EU/China) will be requested to define and use unified trial specifications, unified trial frequency bands and to share data. Joint deliverables, like joint tests reports, white papers, publications and standard contributions, will also be expected. In addition, the 5G trials' infrastructures shall be deployed in one or more cities in each region (EU/China).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 6 million for a period between 24 and 36 months would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals with a different budget or duration.
Expected Impact:
- Holistic 5G networks implementations based on the latest 5G innovations and evaluated in the two prominent usage scenarios.
- 5G RAN for the specified bands validated in real world environments.
- Global interoperability demonstrations for 5G networks.
- Joint contributions to global 5G standards specifications in relevant organisations (e.g. 3GPP, ITU-R), especially in view of 5G phase 2 standardisation (beyond eMBB), and to harmonized spectrum bands.
- Successful showcasing events with, ideally, joint demonstration across regions.
- New or reinforced cooperation between 5G R&I stakeholders from EU and China, with a focus on private companies (industry, telecom operators, SMEs).

Specific Challenge: Research implementing the Strategic Research Agenda established by the euRobotics AISBL (the private partner in the future Public-Private partnership in Robotics) will be essential to attain a world-leading position in the robotics market. Driven by the applications needs identified in this Strategic Research Agenda (SRA), challenging R&D problems will have to be addressed, to make substantial progress in robots capabilities and improve the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) of robotics R&D. In addition, a dedicated effort is necessary to close the innovation gap, allow large scale deployment of robots and foster market take-up. Robotics is very broad, both in terms of technologies and disciplines it involves, but also in terms of markets and stakeholders. It is therefore essential to address the inherent fragmentation.
Scope: The aim is to develop a new generation of industrial and service robots and underpinning technologies, in particular enabling robotic systems to operate in dynamic real-world environments, reaching measurable improvements of abilities such as autonomy and adaptability and interacting in safe ways with humans.
Collaborative projects will cover multi-disciplinary R&D and innovation activities like technology transfer via use-cases and industry-academia cross fertilisation mechanisms. Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) will further enable prototype development and stimulate deployment of industrial and service robotics.
Projects are strongly encouraged to optimise synergies (e.g: use of shared resources for PCP of R&D&I projects or use cases, collaboration with on-going initiatives). Priority is given to projects driven by industrial or market needs and that are expected to produce step changes in abilities.
a.      Research & Innovation Actions
      RTD to advance abilities and key technologies relevant for industrial and service robotics
-        In terms of market domains, the priorities are: manufacturing, commercial, civil, agriculture
-        The primary goal is to significantly improve the level of industrial and service robotics abilities in the context of the above mentioned market domains by addressing: adaptability, cognitive ability, configurability, decisional autonomy, dependability, flexibility, interaction capability, manipulation ability, motion capability,  perception ability.
-        To reach this ambitious goal, key robotics technologies need to be advanced in the particular fields of cognition, human-robot interaction, mechatronics, navigation, perception. This includes technology combinations such as grasping and dexterous manipulation, physical HRI, mobile manipulation, reactive planning and other combinations, in particular those that connect the key technologies above.
-        To prove the exploitation potential of the results the project outcome is to be shown in market domain-relevant demonstrations proving an increased TRL.
         It will be essential for the deployment of robots to establish systems development processes (from requirement analysis to testing and validation) and to develop techniques and technologies for system design, engineering, architecture, integration,  system of systems, modelling and knowledge engineering which are applicable across market domains.
         Shared resources and assessment
-        One goal will be to define common hardware and software platforms (e.g.: real world test-beds, software libraries and simulators) taking advantage of existing initiatives and facilities. This will require: (a) mechanisms for sharing; (b) harmonisation of system design practice; (c) the definition of standards; and (d) high quality validation, maintenance and documentation.
-        Furthermore, activities will be supported by a benchmarking initiative to provide means for technology assessment and transfer, performance evaluation as well as of paving the way to certification of new robotics systems.
b.      Innovation Actions: Technology transfer - Robotics use cases
Using leading edge science and technology, including results from EU-funded projects, a targeted effort will aim at introducing, testing and validating promising and innovative robotics solutions in real-world conditions. The focus will be on the robust operational deployment of these robotic solutions, based on performance objectives, metrics, and user needs. The strong involvement of stakeholders such as robotics industry, system integrators and end-users is essential.
c.       Pre-commercial procurement in robotics
In addition, demand-driven innovation actions will be pursued in areas of public interest, including pre-commercial procurement of innovative robotics solutions for public safety and monitoring of environment and infrastructures.
Expected impact:
         Increase Europe's market share in industrial robotics to one third of the market and maintain and strengthen Europe's market share of 50% in professional service robotics by 2020.
         Increase Europe’s market share in domestic service robots to at least 20% by 2020 including with new companies and start-ups in the field.
         Improve the competitiveness of Europe's manufacturing sector, in particular SMEs, and address pressing technological challenges and the effect of an aging workforce.
         Increase Industry-Academia cross-fertilisation and tighter connection between industrial needs and academic research via technology transfer, common projects, scientific progress on industry-driven challenges.
         Deploy robotics technologies in new application domains.
         Improve Technology Readiness Levels of robotics technologies.
         Improve performance evaluation and certification of new robotic systems.

Whilst 5G early introduction targets ""local"" network improvements (e.g. at radio access level), the longer term vision targets the realisation of pervasive mobile virtual services, through a network managing compute, storage and transport connectivity functions[1] in an integrated way. The challenge is to transform the network into a low energy distributed computer, where processes and applications are dynamically created, moved and suppressed, depending on the information flows, customer needs, and where new terminal types in cars, objects, appliances, and new interfaces based on gestures, facial expressions, sound and haptics may be the basis of the interaction between humans and the infosystems.
Scope:

- Strand 1: Extension of virtualisation technologies and architectures for Network Management to support i) recursive deployments of functional components for multi-tenancy; ii) high device heterogeneity through virtualisation of resource-constrained devices with load reduction approaches and new network control solutions to effectively handle the authentication, naming, addressing, routing and related functions for massive number of terminals; iii) end to end resource self-configuration and management according to service, traffic, channel or mobility conditions; iv) SDN intelligent network interface selection; v) ultra-dense network deployment with massive user generated traffic; vi) unified management of compute, storage and connectivity resources.
- Strand 2: Security[2]: hardware, software technologies and architectures, level of abstraction for information sharing enabling tenants workloads to trust the host systems. It enables trusted deployment of critical workloads across infrastructure and for infrastructure owners, differentiated services offers to tenants, whilst also improving their own control of their systems, vulnerabilities and compromises. It covers Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) secure provisioning and their remote management, with categorisation of sensitive operations supporting trust domain definition and set up, with real -time identification of possible compromises or security breaches.
- Strand 3: Radio network enabling technologies, architectures and advanced signal processing targeting i) differentiated service requirements, including broadcast/multicast and strategies for spectrum sharing and usage optimisation in licensed and unlicensed bands; ii) terminals as moving nodes for coverage or service extension; iii) network assisted self-driving objects with optimised information fusion/processing from maps, sensors, and events communication; iv) simplified access points through distributed computing and optimised function placement; v) ultra low latency services; vi) applicability of mmWave frequency bands to use cases beyond eMBB; vii) usability of novel spectrum at Teraherz frequencies (incl. visible light communications).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Investments in R&D&I are essential for reinforcing Europe's industrial competitiveness and leadership in photonic market sectors where Europe is strong (e.g. in communications, medical photonics, sensing) and to seize new opportunities. Europe also needs to strengthen its manufacturing base in photonics to safeguard the further potential for innovation and value creation and for job creation. We must better exploit the large enabling potential of photonics in many industrial sectors and in solutions addressing major societal challenges such as health and well-being, energy efficiency or safety. Finally, Europe needs to better exploit the innovation capacity of the photonics SMEs and the innovation leverage potential of the innovation clusters and national platforms.
Scope:
a. Research and Innovation Actions
All R&I actions should demonstrate strong industrial commitment, be driven by user needs and concrete exploitation strategies, and they should cover the value/supply chain as appropriate. They should address manufacturability and include standardisation activities as appropriate. Focus is on one of the following themes:
Application driven core photonic technology developments for a new generation of photonic devices (including components, modules and sub-systems) for agile Petabit/s Optical Core and Metro Networks. The objective is to develop new photonic technologies for metro and core networks allowing capacities of Pb/s per node, and Tb/s per channel and 100 Tb/s per link over increased transport distances, while supporting network programmability features and fitting network operator requirements and roadmaps. Actions should include all new device developments for the envisaged network architecture. The action should also lead to network solutions with an energy consumption and equipment footprint reduction by more than 10 and a significant reduction in network cost. Actions may include system, network, control and security level aspects to the extent necessary for the action.
Photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology: The objective is to achieve major advances in chip integration technology, enabling a cost effective volume manufacturing of PICs with significantly enhanced performances (e.g. integration complexity, footprint, energy efficiency, speed, …) or new functions. Potential for such technology advances exists e.g. in selective area growth for multi-function integration, wider band-gap engineering, heterogeneous integration, wafer-scale electronic-photonic integration, the use of new materials, and in new approaches to small and efficient laser sources. Actions may address also the related design methodology and tools and the optimisation of materials, and should include a validation of results with fabricated PIC prototypes.
Disruptive approaches to optical manufacturing by 2 and 3 D opto-structuring: The objective is to develop new optical manufacturing approaches for photonic components with unprecedented resolution (down to the submicron and nano-scale) or for functionalization of the surface of the materials to tailor and optimise their characteristics for a specific application. Actions may also address the related material. Novelty may be related for example to the laser source, to the optical system for light manipulation, to light-matter interaction or to the exploitation of quantum effects. Actions should include the validation of the manufacturing approach through a functional prototype of an application relevant device that goes clearly beyond the state of the art.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 and 8 million (for theme a.i), between EUR 3 and 4 million (for theme a.ii and a.iii) would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per theme will be selected.
b. Innovation Actions
Focus is on one of the following themes:
i. Innovation Incubator for SMEs[1]
The objective is to reinforce the competitiveness of photonics and end-user industries, in particular SMEs, by providing them one-stop-shop access, supported through competence centres, to services and capabilities such as expertise, training, prototyping, design, engineering or pilot manufacturing services for first users and early adopters enabling the wider adoption and deployment of photonic technologies in innovative products. The service to be provided to the SME should be driven by its business needs and the implementation must be flexible and fast to better cope with the speed of innovation in ICT and the SME requirements.
Large projects are expected to achieve critical mass and to better exploit EU-added value. The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 30.000 – 100.000[2] per party). A maximum of 50% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to this purpose.[3]
ii. Application driven core photonic devices integrated in systems: Actions should address validation and demonstration of photonic based systems for the target applications. Actions should also include standardisation activities. They should demonstrate strong industrial commitment, be driven by user needs and concrete business cases supported by strong exploitation strategies, and cover the whole value/supply chain and the end-user. Focus is on one of the following themes:
Biophotonics: imaging systems for in-depth disease diagnosis: The objective is the demonstration and validation in real-settings of innovative, easy to operate, compact, and non- or minimally invasive imaging systems to support diagnosis of age and life-style related diseases. The imaging system should either be label-free or be based on already/rapidly safety-approved labels. The feasibility and validity of the diagnostics approach should already have been demonstrated and it should potentially have a significant advantage with respect to current diagnostic approaches. The action should further develop, improve and assess the imaging system under a sufficient range of realistic conditions and disease profiles. The evaluation of its usability and applicability and its validation in clinical settings should be included.Actions should be driven by medical equipment manufacturers that are capable of and committed to the commercialisation of the solutions and include teams of physicians/clinicians to take part in the development and the functional and quantitative validation. Clinical trials are not covered by these actions and will normally take place after these actions.
Sensing for process and product monitoring and analysis: The prototyping and testing of new process analytical instrumentation for on-line/in-line control, targeting the food and pharmaceutical industry, based on compact and miniaturized photonics sensors that include novel key photonics components and modules. This new instrumentation should show significant improvements beyond the state of the art in sensitivity, specificity, long term stability (including calibration stability), high measurement rate, and reliability. Instruments should have self-testing/-monitoring functionalities and on-site calibration capabilities. The significant advantages compared to conventional sensors in terms of performance or cost, as appropriate, have to be demonstrated in a specific industrial application for monitoring product quality in real settings.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and 10 million (for theme b.i) and between 6 and 8 million (for theme b.ii) would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Minimum one action per theme will be selected.
c. Coordination and Support actions
Supporting the industrial strategy for photonics in Europe: the objective is to support the development and implementation of a comprehensive industrial strategy for photonics in Europe.

Specific Challenge: The challenge is to improve the framework conditions of the European ICT innovation ecosystem so that it offers the best conditions for innovators to capture the full potential of innovation to transform ideas to the market for sustaining growth and jobs.
Scope:
a.      ICT business idea contests in Universities and High schools
Organise and promote ICT business idea contests addressed to University and high-school students. ICT business ideas contests should be organised at national and subsequently European level. A participation of at least 10 Member States or Associated Countries in the first year (up to all Member States and Associated Countries) should be sought. The first selection takes place at Campus level and will continue gradually up to the European level with a final event Support will go to a well-focused consortium which members should have demonstrated capacity in mobilising students and having experience with similar large scale events.
b.      ICT Entrepreneurship Summer Academy
The creation of a European wide system of Summer Academies for university and last year high school students entirely focused on ICT entrepreneurship. The summer academies will be action oriented and include activities such as ICT and entrepreneurial skills development; experimenting, mentoring; support for business planning and setting up your company; matchmaking; generation and development of ICT-related business ideas. The project will complement, extend and enrich similar existing actions while focusing on the ICT sector and excellence.
c.       ICT Entrepreneurship Labs
Bring entrepreneurs, students, researchers and companies together in experimental spaces to foster innovation driven entrepreneurship. The aim is to foster team-based entrepreneurial activities and deepen interaction between students, entrepreneurs, designers, universities and professors. Activities should combine exploring entrepreneurship as career through classes, workshops, learning by doing, co-working spaces, experimental activities like testing and prototyping, access to resources, coaching and sharing experience with other entrepreneurs, including serial entrepreneurs and successful founders. Particular focus should be on new initiatives that widen participation, including twining to share experience and best practices, on sustainability and support for scaling up.
d.      Campaign on Entrepreneurship culture in innovative ICT sector
Develop a public campaign focused on promoting entrepreneurship and the culture of risk-taking attitude in Europe with a focus on ICT sector. The campaign will address messages like ""I've tried and I've failed"", ""I've tried and I succeeded"" and role models that Europeans can relate and feel encouraged to become entrepreneurs. The objective is to boost the entrepreneurship by changing the perception towards risk aversion in Europe. The accent will be put on lessons learned. The campaign should be promoted through channels at national and European level. In order to make the testimonials relevant enough for all potential entrepreneurs across Europe, the campaign should be promoted in minimum 2/3 of Member States and Associated Countries. This campaign should be part of a long term plan to change the culture of entrepreneurship in Europe.
e.       Support for definition and implementation of Inducement Prizes (or Challenges)
The objective is to define 8 to 12 inducement prize competitions. This includes a validated analysis for multiple ICT thematic areas of technological or societal challenges that potential competitions will solve; development of a list of prize concepts and size of associated prize fund appropriate for addressing the challenges; identification of underlying market failures that each prize seeks to address; definition of success criteria; and, drafting prize competition rules, developing plans for evaluations and operations.
f.       European networks of procurers (European Procurers Platforms)
The objective is to support the creation of European wide networks of procurers that define together an innovation procurement roadmap, identifying shared procurement needs in the near term (relevant for PPI) as well as mid-to-long term (relevant for PCP) in areas of common European interest.
EPPs actions must engage into an open dialogue with all potential stakeholders, including other procurers and end-users. EPPs must publish their perceived procurement needs online, in a way that enables the research and innovation community to comment and submit ideas to make suggestions for future PCPs or PPIs relevant to the focus domain of the EPP. EPPs must also undertake activities that investigate the feasibility and facilitate the concrete preparation of a cross-border PCP or PPI for at least one shared common procurement need.
EPPs must contain a critical mass of public procurers responsible for the acquisition and/or regulatory strategy for innovative solutions in areas of public interest that are large potential customers for ICT LEIT technologies. EPPs must undertake dissemination activities to share results and raise awareness about PCP and PPI across Europe.
Expected impact:
For all activities focus should be on actions with real impact rather than theoretical models and studies. Reuse and pooling of resources, including existing (web) platforms are highly desired. Equal access of women and men to all the activities should also be fostered.
a.       Increased awareness and perception of ICT entrepreneurship among young people in Europe; Development of entrepreneurship skills and exploitation of e-skills.
b.      Increased practical entrepreneurial skills amongst students that will allow them to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations, to start and grow your business or use them in their career.
c.       Increased entrepreneurship, increased number of offered opportunities for entrepreneurs, new initiatives that would have not been started without EC intervention, increased collaboration in respective communities between different actors of the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
d.      Modify the perception of the barriers faced by ICT entrepreneurs and decrease the fear of starting a business. Changing the attitude towards risk-taking will spur innovative ICT-based ventures and should produce a positive effect on the number of new entrepreneurs.
e.       Comprehensive prize design delivered by a consortium with experience in designing inducement prizes. Identification of inducement prize with highest impact and chance of mobilising the stakeholders to engage and participate. Awareness of potential of inducement prises raised beyond the community typically active in the competition area.
f.       More forward-looking, concerted approach to develop common answers to challenges faced by the public sector in a number of countries. Increased opportunities for the supply side to present the demand side the potential of innovative solutions to address concrete public sector challenges. Reduced fragmentation of public sector demand through definition of common specifications and preparation of cross-border procurements.

Specific Challenge: The challenge is to provide support to a large set of early stage high risk innovative SMEs in the ICT sector. Focus will be on SME proposing innovative ICT concept, product and service applying new sets of rules, values and models which ultimately disrupt existing markets.
The objective of the ODI is threefold:
Nurture promising innovative and disruptive ideas;
Support their prototyping, validation and demonstration in real world conditions;
Help for wider deployment or market uptake.  
Proposed projects should have a potential for disruptive innovation and fast market up-take in ICT.
In particular it will be interesting for entrepreneurs and young innovative companies that are looking for swift support to their innovative ideas.
The ODI objective will support the validation, fast prototyping and demonstration of disruptive innovation bearing a strong EU dimension.
Scope:ODI will be implemented through the SME instrument which consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to Phase 1 with a view to applying to Phase 2 at a later date, or directly to Phase 2.
 In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation must be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge ODI and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will offer to complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
         Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
         Market uptake and distribution of ICT innovations.
         Increase of private investment in innovation, notably through private co-investments and/or follow-up investments in successfully supported SMEs.
         The expected impact should be clearly substantiated in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

State-of-the-art AI technologies need to be integrated with advanced manufacturing technologies and systems in order to exploit their potential in manufacturing and process industry. AI systems cooperating with humans can improve production planning and execution, and can help to improve quality of products and processes.
To widely deploy these technologies, specific attention has to be given to standardisation, synchronising EU and Member States activities, and to international collaboration.
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
The focus is on integrating state-of-the-art AI technologies in the manufacturing domain, for example in agile production processes and predictive quality, taking into account the domain-specific requirements in terms of time criticality, safety and security, finding effective ways for collaboration between humans and AI systems, and exploiting the strengths of both humans and machines while keeping the human in control. Ethical principles, as expressed by the high-level expert group on Artificial Intelligence[1] should be followed and recommendations for instantiation in the manufacturing domain should be developed. Proposers are encouraged to build on existing results from artificial intelligence research, for example ICT-26-2018-2020.
Proposals must develop innovative concepts and tools that take into account the status and availability of all relevant production resources, learn from past experiences, and deal effectively with unforeseen events. If appropriate, AI techniques should be combined with digital twins and real-life feedback from the shop floor or production facility to improve quality of products and processes. Generative design approaches for products and processes are encouraged.
Developed technologies and solutions should be demonstrated in at least two different realistic manufacturing use cases of significant economic value. If applicable, legal obstacles to implementation of the proposed solutions should be identified.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Actions (CSA)
Standardisation
Proposals are expected to extend, further develop, and support the implementation of a model for the synchronisation of standardisation activities on AI and related digital technologies in manufacturing at large, at the Member State level and at the European level – and in a global context, taking into account legal and ethical issues where relevant. Proposals need to build on previous activities, such as the results of the Joint MSP/DEI Working Group on standardisation in support of Digitising European Industry[2].
Cooperation EU-Japan
Proposals are expected to support possible cooperation with Japan, in areas relevant for AI-driven innovation in manufacturing and digital industrial platforms. Proposals will assess opportunities, and kick-off cooperation activities, by organising contacts between researchers and companies from EU and Japan working on AI applications for manufacturing, encouraging the exchange of information on the respective research programmes and technological results. Proposals shall foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by Japan to exchange knowledge and experience, exploit synergies and develop recommendations for further sustainable cooperation and collaboration activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 0.5 million would allow these areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. One coordination and support action will be supported for each of the two areas above.
Expected Impact:
Research and Innovation Actions
Products and services usable in a wide range of manufacturing processes leading to agile production processes and improved quality of products and processes
Humans working together with Artificial Intelligence systems in optimal complementarity

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Standards and interoperability for digital technologies play a crucial role as a foundation of an effective Digital Single Market. They ensure that technologies work smoothly and reliably together, provide economies of scale, foster innovation and keep markets open. Fragmentation of standard setting processes along national lines, or the absence of common standards, would significantly slow down innovation and disadvantage European businesses on a global scale.
The standard setting process in the ICT domain faces a number of important new challenges that require a focused, sustained and coordinated European response. There are ever more bodies and organisations involved in ICT standard setting around the world. Improved cooperation, deeper involvement of European specialists, and increased focus are needed in order to ensure that the EU's priorities and the Digital Single Market perspectives are sufficiently represented in the entire spectrum of organisations.
Scope:
The proposal is expected to reinforce the EU presence in the international ICT standardisation scene, by:
Monitoring and gathering information regarding the on-going work from the relevant international and global standards developing organisations (SDOs), fora and consortia, in particular those active in the ICT priority areas identified in the Communication “Priorities for ICT standardisation for the Digital Single Market[1]”. This monitoring should allow European institutions, Member States and industry to better understand where the opportunities and risks are and determine where it is needed to participate and invest resources with maximum impact to promote European strategic interests, both regarding public and users' interests, as well as industrial competitiveness.
To set up and manage a facility to support participation of key European specialists (especially from SMES and Academia) in key SDOs to push for European requirements and promote broader European interest. The facility would intervene in domains and SDOs where there is not enough coverage from European companies and not supported by other instruments (PPPs, EU or national R&I projects) as to avoid overlaps and achieve maximum impact.
The proposal should have the ambition to strengthen the position of the European interests to effectively contribute to, benefit from, and influence the global standardisation landscape. The ultimate goal is to ensure that standardisation activity supports a global market creating opportunities for European businesses and consumers and it is achieved via the most appropriate routes and organisations.
Relevant activities at national and EU level, as well as by industry should be taken into account.
In order to improve European participation in the field of international ICT standardisation, proposals should address the following:
Mapping of the relevant activities in international ICT standardisation, including corresponding SDOs, fora and consortia, in particular regarding the priority domains identified in the Communication “Priorities for ICT standardisation for the Digital Single Market”
Identification of, technical bodies, committees and concrete working items where (more) European resources are needed.
Setting up of a management facility to support participation and leadership (e.g. chairing of technical committees) of key European specialists (including from SMES and Academia) in those organisations and technical bodies identified, to push for European requirements and promote European interest.
Proactively achieving critical mass from industry, including SMEs and Startups, and academia for emerging standardisation activities
Liaise with relevant on-going developments in EU and national funded R&I projects, in particular with projects having identified standardisation output or with potential relevant results, including as well other coordination and support actions, and relevant PPPs[2]
When relevant hosting standardisation meetings and workshop in Europe.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes, in particular regarding the participation of European specialists in international SDOs. The consortium will define the process that will lead to a selection of an additional pool of specialists that may be needed to fulfil the scope of the proposal. In addition ad-hoc selection processes may be required. Financial support for these specialists will be typically in the order of EUR 1.000 – 8.000 per action by third party. It is expected that minimum 70% of the EU funding requested by the proposal should be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties. Third party support is expected to cover the participation of specialists in international ICT standardisation activities to support European interests, including participation in technical bodies, and leadership of relevant committees.
The Commission considers that proposals should cover a period of two years, and that those requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Identification of ICT standardisation areas which need European intervention and proposal of actions to address them;
Engagement of required stakeholders and experts to ensure lasting impact;
Increase the influence or Europe into international ICT standardisation, ensuring promotion of European requirements and interests;
Set-up of a facility to support participation of European experts in international ICT SDOs and technical bodies.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Cloud computing is changing from a pure elastic provisioning of virtual resources (or platforms) to a transparent and adaptive hosting environment that fully realizes the “everything as a service” provisioning concept, from centralised cloud to the edge, and from network and computing infrastructure up to the application layers.
The challenge is to develop comprehensive cloud solutions and testbeds combining various execution platforms for ubiquitous and seamless execution computing environments as a foundation for a complete computing continuum. This requires novel solutions for federating infrastructures, programming applications and services, and composing dynamic workflows, which are capable of reacting in real-time to unpredictable data sizes, availability, locations, and rates. This will provide application developers with greater control over network, computing and data infrastructures and services, and the end-user will benefit from seamless access to continuous service environments. Such solutions should also address security, semantic interoperability, heterogeneous data integration, organisation and linking, data protection, performance, resilience and energy-efficiency requirements to respond to the future digitisation needs of industry and the public sector. Addressing these challenges will also be part of and contribute to the technological ambitions of the Next Generation Internet (NGI).
Scope:
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
Proposals will address at least one of the following areas:
Advanced cloud technologies and testbeds combining aspects of network, computing and data/information resources (i.e., next generation networks, novel datacenter architectures, fog/edge computing and sensor networks, large-scale analytics and simulation, public, hybrid, multi-cloud computing, etc.) to provide complete solutions encompassing network, computing and data services. The key aspect of these advanced cloud technologies is to seamlessly combine computation resources all along the data path and support the complete service lifecycle (i.e. from the end-user request/context to creation of workflows, monitoring of execution platforms, application deployment and adaptation while optimising the execution).
Advanced Cloud Data Privacy and Security techniques taking into account issues such as integrating data protection principles, unifying security policies across cloud services and applications, defining personal data semantics, managing data locality, migration and latency.
Novel programming models and semantically interoperable services to support dynamic environments that respond intelligently to changes in application behaviour or data variability; automatic deployment and continuous dynamic composition of semantically annotated services; adaptability of services to different resources & usage contexts; automatic reasoning, scheduling and deployment of workflows on top of the resulting infrastructure.
The proposals should demonstrate the applicability and viability of the proposed solution across multiple application domains.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and Support Actions (CSA)
Proposals in this action will address the following:
Coordinate stakeholders in Cloud Computing and act as support to R&D programmes/activities by disseminating project results and organising scientific and policy events, developing research and innovation roadmaps, and addressing pre-standardisation initiatives.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 400.000 to 600.000 would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
a) Research and Innovation Actions (RIA)
Contribute to the development of an ecosystem and testbeds that will respond to the future digitisation needs of industry and the public sector;
Assist the development of new cloud-based services and infrastructures in Europe and foster an industrial capability in the cloud computing sector;
Create new opportunities to encourage European-based providers, in particular SMEs, to develop and offer cloud-based services based on the most advanced technologies;
Leverage research and innovation projects to support the development and deployment of innovative cloud-based services and next generation applications, for the public and private sectors (including standardisation and applications for AI, Big-Data and other sector-specific applications).
b) Coordination and Support Actions (CSA)

Today the Internet is key to almost any socio-economic activity, a true value creator which reshapes economic and societal behaviours. This trend is irreversible and in 10 years from now the Internet will be an even more indispensable motor for socio-economic activity worldwide. If Europe aims to shape this future Internet as a powerful, open, data-driven, user-centric, interoperable platform ecosystem, it must take action now.
With a fresh view, the European Commission launches a new track of future Internet research aimed at developing a next generation of the Internet enabled by key technologies and services allowing it to become an open ecosystem avoiding the dominance of a few giant economic players. This coordination and support action will prepare the conditions, mobilise the constituencies and prototype the operations of a large future Next Generation Internet initiative going beyond Horizon 2020.
Scope:
Proposals should cover one of the three bullet points (a, b or c):
a) Coordination and Support action - Identification of research topics
Design, build and apply a methodology to identify continuously those key future technologies that will support an Internet model more open and more inclusive in 10 years from now. For this:
Perform a portfolio analysis, coverage, mapping and gap analysis of ongoing and emerging research topics in future Internet.
Identify those key future Internet technologies, i.e. the game-changers for an Internet in 2025, and deduct specific technology roadmaps.
Analysis programmes and developments in Member States and Associated Countries, and activities in international partner countries.
b) Coordination and Support action - Dynamic and continuous consultation
Build an open, dynamic and continuous consultation process which engages all relevant stakeholders in a long-term and multi-disciplinary fashion. For this include:
The scientific community and outstanding scientists who lead the Internet technology research in Europe.

Software networks provide high flexibility through implementation of virtual network functions (VNFs). VNF's may be chained across several domains to create Network Applications (NetApps) tailored to the requirements of specific tenants, as demonstrated under previous 5G PPP phases. This requires open platforms that provide access to networks resources which can then be used to develop NetApps supporting requirements and developments from specific vertical sectors.
Scope:
Experimentation facilities able to provide enhanced experimentation infrastructures on top of which third party experimenters e.g. SMEs or any service provider and target vertical users will have the opportunity to test their applications in an integrated, open, cooperative and fully featured network platform running across multiple domains where needed, and tailored to specific vertical use case.
The objective is to focus on innovation for operations and secure/trusted service provisioning taking advantage of experimental facilities featuring virtualised and software implemented functions and representative of a redesigned virtualised access/core network. The facilities should provide opportunities for SMEs and developers to experiment their applications in the context of specific vertical use cases on open experimental network platforms, and to create 5G open source repositories for wide use and towards standards development. Typical vertical use cases include connected and automated mobility, smart factories and industry 4.0 use cases. Furthermore, healthcare, PPDR, energy, media though other verticals may be considered.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Testing and validation of NetApp solutions on top of a 5G virtualised experimental environment with different implemented functions and vertical-specific configurations.
NetApps secure interoperability beyond vendor-specific implementation across multiple domains and availability of related standards or reference implementations.
Open-source repository of network applications that can be further leveraged by other developers.
Creation of third party markets for start-ups and SMEs. 50% of SMEs are targeted for this action.
Relevant 5G PPP KPI: Service creation time in minutes.
Generation of results that may be appropriate for transfer towards an incubator or a start up, either within the project or outside of the projects in follow up actions.

In the Communication one the European Cloud Initiative (COM(2016) 178 final), the EC announced its aim to support, together with the EU Member States and European industry, the creation of a world-class European High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data ecosystem built on two exascale computing machines, which would rank in the first 3 places of the world. One of the specific objectives stated in the Communication is to ""foster an HPC ecosystem capable of developing new European technology such as low power HPC chips"".
The objective of the Call is to establish a stable and structured partnership between the EC and the institutions and organisations who commit themselves to establish, maintain and implement a strategic research and innovation roadmap for building European low-power microprocessor technologies underpinning the build-up of future machines for exascale-class HPC, big data and emerging applications. A co-design approach is necessary to bridge the gap between suppliers and users to develop new components adapted to real application needs. The partnership will be set up through a Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA)[1] which will cover the full initiative in order to enable the completion of the research and innovation roadmap within the context of the agreement.
The consortia responding to the call must include manufacturers of microelectronic components and may include research institutes, universities, foundations, SMEs as well as other organisations that are necessary for the development of a European low-power processing unit. The Framework Partnership Agreement shall specify the common objectives, the nature of the actions planned, and the procedure for awarding specific grants.
To support the initiative this Framework Partnership Agreement will be the basis for concluding specific grant agreements. The specific grant agreements are expected to be signed in 2018 and 2020. The overall EC contribution to the initiative in Horizon 2020 is expected to be around EUR 120 million, subject to several factors such as budget availability, quality of proposals and performance of the action.
Scope:
Proposals should address the following points:
The general and specific objectives of the partnership;
The related research and innovation roadmap for the development of innovative low-power Processing Units: functional and non-functional requirements; architectural aspects; firmware and system software; boards and blades; power efficiency options; performance measurement metrics; handling of different technology generations, role of open-source hardware and open-source software, building and demonstrating a machine prototype including TRL and size targets for the machine prototype;
The initial consortium which will implement the initiative, and its governance structure;
The consortium's perspectives of building microprocessor technologies (i.e., today's solutions and their perspectives; the industrial players; a strategy for building up the European approach);
The ability of the consortium to seize exploitation opportunities, including the market and business perspectives (targeted market segments and conditions for successful market introduction, representative HPC, cloud, big-data and emerging benchmarks/applications);
Links to the implementation of the European HPC strategy: how does the proposal contribute to the strategy, how does it relate to the other activities of the strategy such as the extreme scale demonstrators, the development of the pre-exascale machines, and ultimately how will it lead to the development of an exascale machine based on European technology to be procured in the period 2022-2023;
Quantified targets and Key Performance Indicators to assess the expected progress over time;
The way the consortium will foster complementarities, and synergies with relevant national, regional and European research and innovation programmes, including structural funds addressing smart specialisation. The consortium should include an indicative financial plan that combines different sources of financing for the different parts of the FPA activities;
The commitments made by the consortium members, which would be complementary to EU/national contributions.
Expected Impact:
Strengthening the competitiveness and leadership of the European industry & science, in particular the European technology supply, in low-power microprocessor technologies for HPC, Big-Data and other emerging applications.
Potential for European microprocessor technology with drastically better performance/power ratios compared to current offerings for HPC, Big-Data and emerging applications.

5G offers prospects for a range of new technologies and hardware devices to enter the market and to create economic opportunities for new and innovative market actors. The challenge is hence to reap the fruits of earlier R&D investments in these enabling technologies to support the emergence of new markets and new market actors in Europe.
Scope:
a) Innovation Actions (IA)
Enabling technologies: The key 5G technological blocks under consideration are primarily hardware-based and include, but are not limited to, phase array antenna, array processors, millimetre wave devices and subsystems, photonics based devices, baseband processor platforms, low-cost access points, new generation of 5G terminals notably for future Connected and Automated Mobility, in order to provide opportunities for innovative high-tech SMEs access to new markets through pilot validation of promising solutions. A special emphasis will be put on new types of IoT devices demonstrating the use of 5G connectivity functionalities addressing requirements of one or several vertical industry sectors.
The actions go beyond individual components and also address integration and validation of technologies as part of an overall architecture representing a subset of 5G network functions. Their added value is in the validation of the target component as part of its integration into an overall architecture representing a subset of 5G network functions.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
b) Coordination and support actions (CSA)
Enabling technologies applicable to connectivity systems are increasingly important in the context of strategic autonomy. Europe is not anymore leading connectivity technologies that are applied at terminal/device level (e.g. advanced processor and ancillary device technologies) or at network level, such as the needed hardware processing/ acceleration that are increasingly needed to deploy real time virtualised functionalities. Whilst new opportunities have been opened by future connectivity systems that operate at millimetre or higher frequencies, Europe has not prominently positioned itself on these new markets, in spite of significant know-how acquired with military and space systems.
Against this background, the objective of the target support actions are:
definition of the expected core hardware components of future connectivity systems where Europe should seize opportunities and strengthen its capabilities, taking into account the characteristics and architectures, including security, of future connectivity platforms;
definition of the required R&I and investment requirements related to the identified domains;
definition of related industry roadmap in partnership among relevant EU actors, both from industry and academia;
The Commission considers that a proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
a) Innovation Actions (IA)
support to the emergence of a European offer for new 5G core technologies at TRL 7 or beyond.
support to the emergence of new actors in the related markets.
creation of high tech start-ups or of new business opportunities for established SME's.

Specific challenge: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic disease affecting worldwide around 17 Million people. The disease T1DM may present at any age, but most typically presents in early life with a peak around puberty. The incidence rate is highest in Europe affecting altogether 22 /100.000 per year, with major regional differences and an overall 25% higher incidence rate than in the US (www.diapedia.org). The rising incidence of T1DM appears to be explained by faster conversion from islet-antigen seropositivity to manifest β-cell failure. However, the scientific insights to the triggering events, disease susceptibilities, and subsequent pathophysiological events leading to failing β-cell function & beta cell loss in human disease are quite limited. Rational disease modifying therapeutic approaches to address T1DM are lacking.
Please refer to the full topic text on the IMI2 Call 1 section of the IMI website: http://www.imi.europa.eu/content/stage-1-13
Scope:  The overall aim of the project is to significantly progress the understanding of the T1DM disease and its patients by bringing together leading clinicians and researcher from the areas of Immunology, Beta cell biology, and biomarker research from academia and industry. It is expected that this initiative will significantly progress the molecular understanding of the pathophysiology of T1DM and of the impact provided by standard of medical care upon T1DM patients.
Please refer to the full topic text on the IMI2 Call 1 section of the IMI website.
Expected impact: The project should help gain an improved molecular understanding of the T1DM patients, deliver insights into the  disease heterogeneity and provide tools for identification of high-risk patients.

Specific challenge
In view of the current epidemic, the WHO has identified the progression of vaccine candidates currently in development as an urgent public health need. Several candidate vaccines are available. Prime/boost vaccine approaches are promising, as they may provide protection against Ebola infection that is of longer duration.
Scope
Design and implementation of Phase I, II, or III clinical development of vaccine candidates, including prime boost combinations against Ebola virus disease (Zaire), to start in early 2015. The applicants must have vaccine candidates available and demonstrate the ability to roll out clinical trial vaccination programmes in EU / Africa, and to conduct studies in areas where Ebola virus disease is endemic. The clinical development programme(s) need(s) to be aligned with the global effort coordinated by the WHO.
Proposals addressing Topic 1 must include plans to set up a Central Information Repository for the Ebola+ programme for sharing results, learnings and data both amongst Ebola+ partners and with the outside community.  The information repository should include (but not exclusively be restricted to): The capability to capture basic experimental data via an electronic lab notebook; A pharmacological screening platform for the capture, analysis and sharing of assay data and a system for capturing, analysing and sharing translational/clinical data. Applicants should in the first instance re-use capabilities that have been developed in other IMI projects and new capabilities should only be developed where no other alternative already exists. Finally any solution should include a strategy that ensures the long term sustainability of the data so that it remains accessible to the scientific community beyond the time-line of the project.
In addition, proposals addressing Topic 1 should include plans to set up a Scientific Advisory Board including proposed membership representing key stakeholders to give scientific and strategic advice to both specific projects and to the overall programme.  Likewise, proposals should include plans to set up an Ethics Board whose role would be to ensure that all activities carried out under the programme fully account for any ethical considerations[1].
It is considered that an IMI2 JU financial contribution of 70-110 million and an EFPIA in-kind contribution of EUR 10-20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Clinical study designs and therefore costs are likely to be influenced by several external factors such as; evolution of the current outbreak in West Africa and the precise requirements of regulatory authorities.
Expected impact
The vaccine development programme(s) are/is expected to provide the data to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccine(s) in preventing EVD. The projects are thus expected to have a major impact on global health, both at the individual and the public health level. Learnings from this programme will also have an impact on the worldwide capacity to quickly develop vaccines in situations of global public health emergencies.
Special information
Since the implementation of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials is linked to manufacturing capability, projects funded under Topics 1 and 2 of this Call are expected to work in collaboration to ensure maximal impact.

Specific challenge
In view of the current epidemic, the WHO has identified the progression of vaccine candidates currently in development as an urgent public health need. Because Ebola vaccines are recombinant adenovirus or other viral-based vaccines and need to be produced in facilities meeting an appropriate biosafety level, manufacturing the quantity of vaccine doses necessary for large-scale clinical testing and that can be thereafter urgently deployed represents a major challenge.
Scope
The project(s) will work on scaling up the currently available production techniques to the necessary scale and will be fully compliant with good manufacturing practices (GMP) and biological safety level requirements.
a.      Costs and milestones are requested for manufacturing activities at volumes in the range of:
                100,000 – 250,000 vaccine courses
                250,000 – 2M vaccine courses
                2M – 20M vaccine courses
Consideration to Drug Substance manufacture (formulated vaccine bulk) and finished Drug Product (vialed vaccine doses) should be given. Alternative manufacturing platforms to those currently utilised, or process improvement activities to increase vaccine manufacturing yields, may also be proposed.
b.      Production and release of finished Drug Product is currently foreseen as a key bottleneck.  Based on current regulatory requirements, non-replicating viral vaccine vectors need to be filled in BSL-2 compliant manufacturing facilities.  This limits the number of manufacturers (CMOs and pharmaceutical companies) that are able to offer their services for fill and finish of an Ebola vaccine.  Proposals are sought to generate additional data to help provide the necessary scientific, technical and regulatory justifications to seek a reclassification of such vectors such that they require BSL-1 containment, thereby opening up the potential for more manufacturers to assist in responding to the current outbreak.
It is considered that an IMI2 JU financial contribution of 10-20 million and an EFPIA in-kind contribution of EUR 70-110 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact
The project will deliver a manufacturing platform to provide the capacity for producing the required number of vaccine doses in GMP quality. Getting this type of production capacity online will have impact more generally for European competitiveness in the area of biological production under appropriate biological safety level conditions.

Specific challenge
To control the epidemic, ensuring vaccination coverage is of critical importance.  In addition, to ensure lasting protection, a booster dose with a heterologous vaccine may potentially be required.  This creates additional challenges for compliance i.e. guaranteeing that the right vaccine dose is given at the right time.  Furthermore, the countries mostly affected by the current epidemic experience a climate of distrust in vaccines. Lack of community acceptance represents a significant challenge that could potentially derail both vaccine trials and vaccine distribution.
Scope
The project will develop i) technologies and tools that augment the adherence to the vaccination regimen at individual level. It will also ii) look into environmental factors that impact compliance and look at how to favourably influence these at community level.
The project will be rolled out and operationalised during conduct of the large scale phase II and III vaccination trials conducted under Topic 1 of this Call to assess the safety and efficacy of a candidate vaccine. Those trials offer an opportunity to test and validate any new tools and technologies. One option can be to exploit the high penetration of mobile telecommunication and use of mobile apps in West Africa. Proposals that will use mobile communication strategies to increase awareness, acceptance and subject recruitment in the vaccination campaigns or will create specific apps to remind participants of their appointments and keep track of their response or side effects are encouraged. In this type of project it is essential to guarantee privacy of subjects. To that end the operation as such of the telecommunication infrastructure within the study needs to be clearly separated from the scientific work, for example by having different legal entities responsible for the different aspects.
Ethical considerations must also figure in the assessment, taking into account the health-systems context.
The project will develop specific tailor made communication programmes that should help with the overall acceptance of the vaccination programme, and increase the willingness of the community to fully comply with the vaccination regimen.
The scope of the project includes research on community vaccine acceptance and attitude towards vaccines.
Welcome are also considerations on how monitoring of adverse events could be put in place, and how vaccinees who get a fever should be handled.
It is considered that an IMI2 JU financial contribution of approximately 25 million and an EFPIA in-kind contribution of approximately EUR 25 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nevertheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact
The proposed project is expected to provide a fully validated tool or system that captures critical information for each vaccinee (date, dose, batch no.), allows for automated recalls to the vaccinee for subsequent doses, central tracking of overall vaccination coverage and compliance, all in a user friendly, cost economic way. 
Improved overall acceptance and a positive attitude towards vaccination programmes will facilitate the conduct of clinical trials in endemic regions, and will increase compliance and help to combat both the current epidemic and prevent outbreaks in the future.

Specific challenge
Rapid detection of Ebola infections in the field or at decentralised healthcare centers is an urgent need in the current crisis of the outbreak of EVD and will remain important even after the current crisis may have subsided. Additional technologies addressing various healthcare facilities settings will also be important to maintain surveillance in the long term. Current PCR-based tests have a number of limitations related to time and procedures requiring infrastructures and specific training. Tools and technologies are needed to provide quality diagnostics at low cost. Several such tests are already under development but their performance and practicability are unknown.
Scope
The project(s) will work on developing rapid diagnostics to detect EVD at acceptable costs and with very high sensitivity and specificity. At a minimum a rapid diagnostic test should be able to be deployed at decentralised health care facilities under conditions with minimum laboratory infrastructures available. Projects can work on validating existing tests or on expanding the use of tools currently being developed, through clinical validation to registration and launch. Projects must in any case include a phase of clinical validation in the field under real-world conditions, address manufacturing and access path to ensure sustainable distribution including taking into account ethical considerations and the health systems context. Any suitable technology can be used but the focus should be on practical solutions that meet the following criteria:
-       Very high sensitivity and specificity
-       Ability to be deployed in resource-limited settings
-       Minimal training required to operate
-       Capability of multiplexing in order to include different ebola strains
-       Time to result 15-30 minutes (desirable) – 3 hours (acceptable)
-       Sample type for intake: blood (capillary fingerstick desirable), other less invasive sample types (urine, etc.)
Additional capabilities to provide epidemiological monitoring (eg. Internet connectivity) would be valuable.

CNS disorders are highly prevalent, chronic, and disabling diseases, with depression alone affecting an estimated 121 million people worldwide.
The onset of relapses in CNS disease causes changes in parameters related to sleep, physical activity, speech, cognition, social connectivity, memory that can be measured remotely and passively via unobtrusive on-body biosensors.
The vision of RADAR-CNS is to reduce cost and trauma to the patient and care-givers and reducing hospitalisations by predicting, and pre-empting relapses and reoccurrences via the use of remote assessment technologies.
Scope
This topic is planned to be focused on the three diseases of unipolar depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy.  For each disease it is proposed that a non-interventional/observational study of subjects is undertaken with three objectives:
         Characterisation of changes in disease state
         Characterisation of changes in disease state due to drug effects
         Prediction change in disease state from remote sensing data
Expected Impact
Identification and validation of biosignatures that predict relapse and track disease state changes in MS, Depression and Epilepsy.
Development of technology, data privacy controls and regulatory pathways necessary for approval of remote sensing solutions in real-world patients
Validation through clinical studies allowing these technologies to be rapidly brought to the patient.

Specific Challenge Current therapies for type 2 diabetes focus on the control of blood glucose levels rather than the modification of the disease.  Therefore more robust delineation of clinical risk factors, phenotypes, and molecular biomarkers is needed to identify individuals at risk of rapid progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes for disease prevention therapeutic intervention trials.  More intensive phenotyping of individuals with type 2 diabetes is needed to characterize rates of disease progression and to identify and validate biomarkers and/or indicators of “rapid failure” of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells and of cellular targets of insulin-mediated glucose disposition, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and adipocytes.  Validation of robust markers of type 2 diabetes disease progression would facilitate patient segmentation for feasible assessments of new therapeutic options for disease modification Scope
The overall aim of the project is to discover and validate a molecular taxonomy of type 2 diabetes to enable feasible patient segmentation, clinical trial design, and regulatory paths for diabetes prevention and for modification of diabetes disease progression.
Expected Impact
Project is expected to discover and validate human phenotypes and biomarker panels for patient segmentation/selection, clinical trial design and regulatory paths to assess new therapeutic options for prevention of type 2 diabetes as well as slowing down the progression of the disease.
In addition new regulatory approaches or standards enabling innovative and feasible clinical trial designs for disease modification in patients with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes will be developed. As well as benefit/risk models for public health and economic impact of those interventions.

Successful novel approaches for patient stratification could reduce the still high number of non-responders. Developing new analgesics is challenging because promising preclinical data are often not reproduced in the clinic, and often without knowing the reason. Improved pharmaco-dynamic biomarkers could define whether an intended target is adequately engaged, greatly reducing the risk in clinical development of a new drug. Finally, for many pain indications, there are no adequate preclinical models available, precluding preclinical investigations and leaving affected patients with little hope of relief. The goal of this Topic is to make advances in three pain areas in a complementary manner. These three Subtopics, each of which addresses a specific scientific challenge, together offer significant opportunities for cross-fertilisation:
Subtopic 3A: using Patient Reported Outcome Measures to improve the management of acute and chronic pain (PROMs);
Subtopic 3B: improving the translatability of pharmacodynamic biomarkers in pain pathways of healthy subjects and preclinical species (BIOM);
Subtopic 3C: improving translation in chronic pelvic pain (CPP).
Stage 1 short proposals from Applicants should address only one of these Subtopics. Applicants can submit a proposal to any of the subtopics and are not obliged to apply for all.
Whilst contributions to each subtopic will require mobilization of specialist expertise, it is a key objective of this Topic to create a research platform for pain that will contribute significantly to reduce fragmentation and generate highest impact on the whole area. Thus, to maximise cross-learnings and full data sharing while insuring economy of scale, it is envisaged that a single full proposal is submitted at stage 2. This full proposal will include activities covering all three subtopics, as well as overarching joint activities such us overall governance, communication and dissemination, and data and knowledge management.
Thus at Stage 2, the full proposal will be submitted by the consortium created by the merger of the winning Applicant Consortia of all subtopics (3A+3B+3C) with the Industry consortium.

This full proposal will include activities covering all three subtopics, as well as overarching joint activities such as overall governance, communication and dissemination, and data and knowledge management.
Subtopic 3A PROMs:
The scope of the PROMs Subtopic will be to establish operational benchmarks in the management of post-operative and other acute pain conditions, and in the prevention of its chronification, as well as in the management of chronic pain conditions such as neuropathic pain and chronic pelvic pain (CPP). In particular, these will allow identification of risk factors for the transition of acute into chronic neuropathic post-surgical pain, and thus enable novel therapeutic mitigations to be developed. The results are expected to provide motivation for all stakeholders involved in pain management (e.g. HCPs, patients, scientific societies, and policy makers) that the use of PROMs to monitor post-operative and other pain conditions in daily clinical practice, together with their documentation into a readily accessible database, is of benefit for assuring the success of treatments and aimed at preventing pain chronification.
Subtopic 3B BIOM:
The scope of the BIOM Subtopic is to generate valid clinical pharmacodynamic biomarkers of peripheral, spinal and central neuronal activities, and to develop detailed PK/PD models for drugs which target these compartments in healthy subjects. The PD read-outs should include threshold tracking, quantitative pharmaco-EEG, laser-evoked event-related potentials (ERPs), pharmaco- or evoked-pain fMRI, and will be compared to pain ratings assessed by visual analogue scales.
The clinical biomarkers will be back-translated into rodents to investigate the effect of comparable pharmacological exposures. As with the clinical studies, preclinical PK/PD models will be generated, and the results compared to more classical pain model outcomes to gain understanding of potential PD efficacy relationships
Subtopic 3C CPP:
Despite the high incidence of chronic pelvic pain, understanding of the pathological conditions leading to it is sparse, and diagnostic tools such as biomarkers are unspecific or do not exist at all. Consequently the scope of the subtopic CPP is to improve this unsatisfactory situation by thorough analysis of patient phenotypes. This should identify specific clinical and molecular markers which would permit a patient stratification which increases the chances for selecting effective therapies. Back-translation of clinical biomarkers into preclinical models is sought, as well as the subsequent refinement of these models to more adequately reflect clinical disease phenotypes. Such refined models will generate new opportunities to evaluate the clinical potential of novel therapeutics.
Expected Impact:
The overall key impact of the execution of this topic, via its three components as indicated in the subtopics, will be to improve and standardise different patient-centric treatments for the management of acute and chronic pain, ostensibly the most burdensome disease in terms of patient suffering and healthcare costs. In particular, it is anticipated that new tools and methods will pave the way to the identification of improved treatments which are able to reduce both the disease intensity of acute and chronic pain and the risk of chronification of post-surgical and other acute pain conditions, thus assuring a better quality of life for pain patients. Another impact will be that by deepening the disease understanding, stratification and enrichment markers will be identified and refined, helping to enable precision medicine.
In addition, it is expected that better understanding of the successful translation from preclinical into clinical studies, and of back-translation from the clinic into improved preclinical models, will reduce attrition rates in drug discovery, and enhance the feasibility and speed of the development of novel drugs."

","19 October 2017","Specific Challenge:
Diabetes represents an increasing global healthcare challenge. Controlling blood glucose is a cornerstone in diabetes management aiming to reduce the increased morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. However, only around 50% of patients achieve accepted international glycaemic targets.
Hypoglycaemia is common, and the importance of hypoglycaemia as a major concern for both healthcare professionals and patients is reflected by its impact on intrusions into daily living as well as serious consequences including hospitalisation and mortality. Hypoglycaemia and the fear of hypoglycaemia represent a recognised and measurable contributor to the burden of disease for people afflicted by diabetes, as well as their families, friends, and other parties – also known as ‘The Greater Patient’.
Thus, hypoglycaemia is an important clinical issue for many people with diabetes, and it constitutes a major concern for patients on glucose lowering treatment regimens, who face the daily challenge of achieving accepted glucose targets safely, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia.
In recent years we have seen an increasing number of phase III clinical trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but despite the improved accuracy of glucose measuring devices and increased patient access to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology, detecting and reliably registering hypoglycaemic events in clinical trials remain a challenge. No approved guidelines or methods for how hypoglycaemia should be measured exist. Regarding hypoglycaemia, detailed monitoring of blood glucose and the recording of daily events, including physical activity and diet, are rarely carried out. Although data on severe and in most cases, symptomatic hypoglycaemia are collected during the trial period, information on other types of hypoglycaemia, particularly asymptomatic as well as episodes wherein patient outcomes are not immediately noticeable is limited. Moreover, people with a past history of severe hypoglycaemia are often excluded from clinical trials and little if any information is routinely collected on other types of pre-trial hypoglycaemia; as a consequence, this type of information is rarely included in post-trial analyses.
The current gaps and challenges in our understanding of hypoglycaemia consequently limit the management of hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, a consensus between healthcare professionals and other professional bodies including the regulatory authorities on the definitions of the clinical categories of hypoglycaemia is lacking which makes analyses of hypoglycaemic episodes difficult. Thus the overarching objective of this call topic is to reduce the risk and burden of hypoglycaemia and, as a consequence, ultimately improve glycaemic control in people with diabetes. To achieve this we will focus on a number of related specific challenges including:
The need for a better understanding of the clinical determinants and consequences of hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia unawareness;
The need to adopt scientifically sound, consistent, and clinically meaningful definitions of hypoglycaemia that will be accepted by practicing clinicians, regulators, industry and academia in order to probe clinical data;
The need for creating standard guidelines that will be accepted by regulators globally for how to measure hypoglycaemic events to test glucose lowering drugs with respect to occurrence rates or severity of hypoglycaemic episodes;
The need for standardized collection of clinical and laboratory data within clinical trials to increase our understanding of hypoglycaemia;
The need for including hypoglycaemia in the current approach to determine the ‘value for patients’ in the context of clinical development;
The need for better insights into the underlying pathophysiology and defects in the counter-regulatory mechanisms associated with hypoglycaemia ,recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes and hypoglycaemia unawareness.
Scope:
To achieve our objective of reducing the risk and burden of hypoglycaemia and ultimately improving glycaemic control in people with diabetes, we aim to gain a better understanding of hypoglycaemia through a series of integrated activities that are expected to include:
Non-clinical and clinical research into the mechanisms of counter-regulation and hypoglycaemia unawareness to identify targets for intervention;
Establishment of a large, consolidated database of hypoglycaemia captured in clinical trials across glucose lowering drug development programs from partner companies and a pooled CGM database collected using various glucose monitoring devices;
Probing the databases to characterize clinically relevant hypoglycaemia and to determine the causes and consequences of such events;
Evaluating glucose measuring techniques to define standard detection guidelines for measuring hypoglycaemia events and the accuracy of the detection;
Developing best practice for the collection of clinical and laboratory data in clinical trials in order to assess hypoglycaemic events;
Shaping health economic outcomes research (HEOR) to determine the value of reducing hypoglycaemia risk;
Identifying existing patient-driven qualitative and quantitative research (self-reporting studies, surveys, etc.) and conducting a related meta-analysis of the obtained data;
Opening a dialogue with regulatory agencies to define clinically meaningful endpoints/methods to document rates of hypoglycaemia and the potential to reduce these with pharmacological intervention.
Expected Impact:
The proposed programme will lead to:
The establishment of a unique clinical trial database developed specifically for this programme that will contain anonymized, standardized and harmonized data from patients with T1DM and/or T2DM on glucose lowering treatment regimens which will subsequently become available for other interested researchers to access;
Agreement amongst all stakeholders on the applicability of the definitions of clinically meaningful hypoglycaemia through examination of the combined clinical trial data set, clinical data and CGM;
Enhanced understanding and agreement of standard approaches for how best to design trials to assess hypoglycaemia and how to analyse the data;
Generation of information relating to existing and novel aspects of hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia risk leading to a better understanding of hypoglycaemia mechanisms, and novel targets for prevention and/or intervention;
Exploration of the relationship between clinical trial database findings and real-time glucose measurement datasets from continuous glucose monitoring;
Stronger evidence on the utility of non-laboratory glucose measurement and data analysis technologies
A 360° assessment of the burden of hypoglycaemia for patients and society that will enrich our understanding of hypoglycaemia, complement our understanding derived from clinical studies and add perspective to related clinical recommendations;
Generation of evidence-based data to support discussions with regulatory authorities on acceptable definitions of hypoglycaemia."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men.
Most recent clinical research focuses on the late stages of PCa, but there is a lack of data to support clinical practice in the early stages. While prognostic factors linked with overall survival have been proposed, there is no clear treatment path according to these factors. Despite a large increase in new technologies, there is also scarce data on whether real world outcomes of patients are improving.
Scope:
Address the scarcity of epidemiologic, clinical, genomic/biomarker, economic, patient reported outcome, and humanistic data on the treatment path of prostate cancer including all stages of the disease. Leverage real-life data on patients from different European countries, using existing registries, trial data, and data from prostate cancer specialized centres as well as data from patient groups.

","06 September 2018","Specific Challenge:
To improve therapy, the understanding of the tumour microenvironment needs to evolve. Firstly, the understanding of tumour/host interaction on the cellular and molecular level in the absence of therapeutic intervention needs to improve. Both individual tumours and individual hosts are heterogeneous with respect to the quality and degree of immunity. Understanding the cellular and molecular nature of the tumour microenvironment will (i) help us characterise the ability of a patient’s immune system to mount an anti-tumour attack and (ii) provide ideas which pharmacological interventions may support or activate the immune cells to attack the tumour cells.
Secondly and in close alignment with the previous paragraph, one needs to understand how current therapeutic approaches affect the host/tumour interaction to have a baseline from which to improve the current therapeutic paradigm. Such data could be used to further improve currently available treatments or to develop new potential therapeutic strategies.
The proposed topic, for the first time, will assemble a consortium to generate a data set sufficient to gain a meaningful view of the tumour micro-environment. The generation of such a data set is the core activity of this IMI2 JU topic while the future purposes (improvement of the currently available treatments and development of potential therapeutic strategies) go beyond the frame of this topic.
Scope:
The ultimate aim and core activity is to create a database containing integrated cellular and molecular data from the tumour microenvironment of patients treated with both targeted and non-targeted therapy, in particular immunotherapy, as well as key information from patient history and clinical progression.
Core activity (broad profiling):
development of a fully integrated data set of defined immune cell subsets (deliverables (1) and (2)) in samples from patients from specific cancer indications treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and, in particular, targeted immune checkpoint therapy and correlation to the oncogenomic profile of the tumour.
Supplemental activities:
in-depth profiling of a subset of samples from patients undergoing immunotherapy using selected advanced technologies;
development of a sustainable open-access, royalty-free and precompetitive database that houses such a data set, including the required privacy settings;
generation of a biomarker validation platform to identify and start to characterise potential predictive biomarkers for single-agent and combinatorial immunotherapy trials.
Expected Impact:
A comprehensive database, profiling immune cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME) of patients that are responsive to immune checkpoint blockade versus those that are not, is generally lacking at the present time and therefore the creation of such a database is the ultimate aim of this IMI2 JU topic. A searchable database, with integrated tumour genomic information along with matched immune profiles and (immune) therapy outcome, will enable users to identify biological networks involved in, and develop biomarkers to predict response to, immunotherapy. Maximum impact would be achieved by continued integration of clinical outcome data received after the end of the consortium. This IMI2 JU topic is expected to be the basis for future significant impacts but these will go beyond the scope and timeframe of the IMI2 JU topic:
identification of novel predictive biomarkers and patient selection strategies and thereby improving clinical response rate to current cancer immunotherapy and other therapeutic regimens in oncology; such discoveries and improvements should enhance clinical and healthcare practice;
understanding mechanism(s) of resistance to current immunotherapy, but also other therapy regimens, to enable identification of new therapeutic targets;
establishing rational combination immunotherapy strategy (this should strengthen competitiveness and help to address the specific societal challenge of low response rates in cancer patients to current therapies);
deriving therapy solutions for patients that are insensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (thus generating a positive impact on European cancer patients’ health and wellbeing in the long-term);
understanding molecular effects and potential safety liability of immunotherapy."

Information to guide decision making for the safe and effective use of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding is a large unmet need that hinders optimal care of women of childbearing potential. Pregnant women with serious illness need medicines, to treat conditions in order to prevent irreversible damage to their health and the health of their unborn child. These patients, together with their healthcare professionals (HCPs), are invariably interested in better information on the risks that their disease and/or medication can pose to the foetus as well as to babies during breastfeeding.
There is therefore an unmet need for a science and data driven approach to define the standards for generating data on medicines used during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It will result in better and more complete scientific information on drug effects on pregnancy and lactation and this will be used to inform treatment decisions and will increase the quality of care for women.
Scope:
The scope of this topic is to better inform the use of medicines during pregnancy and breastfeeding. To change current practices, the overall objective is to provide improved tools and methods to generate more valuable, reliable and timely information to HCPs and pregnant and lactating women to enhance optimal care.
Expected Impact:
The project is expected to deliver scientifically sound and validated way of producing data to assess medication-related adverse pregnancy outcome and to better characterise and predict the excretion of medicines in breast milk. This will enable regulatory bodies to assess data and include enhanced information in the labels, providing prescribers and patients with much needed information to guide treatment decisions for the benefit of women and children. It will generally improve the health of our next generation. In the absence of the information generated through the project, the diseased pregnant and breastfeeding population will continue to be underserved."

Early and reliable detection and monitoring of adverse events is essential for improving of patient safety, reducing late attrition of drug candidates, and enhancing understanding of toxic mechanisms. In particular, biomarkers that provide insights into mechanisms of tissue injury have the potential to revolutionise drug development as well as diagnosis of diseases. Therefore, the development of innovative, non-invasive biomarkers of tissue injury is of great interest to drug developers, regulators and the broader scientific community. Recent progress in biomarker development including the previous SAFE-T (http://www.imi-safe-t.eu/) that identified several promising biomarker approaches as well as the latest scientific advances in analysis of circulating microRNA provide excellent opportunities for biomarker research. Furthermore, the recent progress in regulatory science of biomarker qualification achieved by the Critical Path Institute and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) provides a blueprint for conduct of formal qualification of emerging biomarkers via an innovative translational paradigm that relies on tissue injury caused by diseases and only limited clinical and non-clinical studies for assessment of biomarker performance. This approach optimises resource use and accelerates biomarker development.
Scope:
The TransBioLine project will focus on development of biomarkers of injury for liver, kidney, pancreas, vasculature, central nervous system (CNS) and the development of non-invasive liquid biopsies. The project will have four strategic goals:
1. Develop data sets enabling the implementation of emerging safety biomarkers in clinical trials and/or diagnosis of disease;
2. Develop non-invasive mechanistic biomarkers of tissue damage called “liquid biopsy” that will have a potential to revolutionise drug development and diagnosis of disease;
3. Develop standardised assays and technologies for detection of biomarkers and data interpretation;
4. Achieve regulatory acceptance for biomarkers.
Expected Impact:
The biomarkers developed during TransBioLine are expected to accelerate drug development by providing innovative drug development tools and also significantly improve diagnosis of disease by enabling non-invasive interrogation of disease mechanisms. The availability of qualified biomarkers as drug development tools will have a broad positive impact on patient safety in clinical trials as well. The TransBioLine will open new markets by introducing new commercially available diagnostic products and services by diagnostic companies and SMEs. This will strengthen the competiveness and industrial leadership of Europe. TransBioLine will enable the development of new innovative biomarker approaches derived from genomics applicable as non-invasive “liquid biopsies” providing tools for precision diagnosis of mechanisms of toxicity or disease at the molecular level. Although the formal qualification of biomarkers as drug development tools by regulatory agencies is the ultimate deliverable, the biomarker data produced by TransBioLine will enable the acceptance of biomarkers by regulatory agencies under individual Investigational New Drug (INDs) even before the biomarkers are fully qualified."

On average it takes about 14 years for a new drug to travel from the research lab to market approval at an average cost of ≥€2 billion. Only 10% of compounds that enter preclinical testing ever make it into clinical trials, with only 20% of these achieving marketing approval. It is therefore very important to advance approaches to decrease the time, reduce costs and improve success rates during the development of drugs.
One approach is the repurposing of high-quality pharmaceutical industry compounds that have stalled at some stage during research or development. Many of these compounds have already undergone preliminary testing in humans, but have not been progressed further because they were not found to be sufficiently effective in the indication for which they were originally developed.
These compounds represent valuable tools that researchers can use to test their novel hypotheses for alternative therapeutic indications, with the ultimate aim of identifying alternative uses for these compounds in other indications. Since partial preclinical and clinical documentation packages have been developed for these assets, any positive findings hold the opportunity to progress towards the market more quickly and cost-effectively, with the ultimate goal of benefiting patients in diseases of high unmet need.
This asset-sharing repurposing programme through IMI2 JU aims to provide researchers across the EU to form hypothesis, to engage in collaborative research with industry and to access discontinued compounds that have already passed through several stages of the drug development process.
In this call, compounds, together with key information on their mechanism of action, pharmacology, safety, tolerability and exclusions, are made available for exploration in the area of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (please find more details in the topic text). More precisely, applicants are invited to submit proposals to utilise these assets to test their hypotheses, to generate clinical data and, if needed, prerequisite preclinical data, with the ultimate aim of taking these assets to the market in alternative indications to those that they were originally developed for.
Scope:
The overall objective of this pilot programme is to take one of the previously deprioritised clinical compounds and investigate their therapeutic potential in new clinical indications in the area of Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
These compounds are listed in the topic text together with key information including mechanism of action, original indication, route of administration pharmacology, safety, tolerability and links to previous clinical studies and publications, to facilitate idea generation by investigators with hypotheses for novel uses. These compounds have all been through clinical phase 1 studies.
Proposals should cover clinical Phase 2A proof of concept studies, though larger Phase 2 studies are also in scope if these are within the budget. Clinical submissions should aim at moving towards the next stage of development and positive data should be a starting point for further investment into developing a drug towards clinic and regulatory approval;
If preclinical work is deemed necessary to provide additional support and confidence before moving into a clinical study in an alternative indication, proof-of-concept/feasibility preclinical studies of up to a year in duration can be included in the proposal. These studies should have clear go/no-go criteria for progressing in to the clinical phase of the project.
This programme intends to support only innovative clinical development for the compounds. This means that proposals for clinical development should not be considered in an indication which has been already tested (i.e. original primary indication or additional studies) or if there are already ongoing or planned clinical studies on identical or related disease indications with the compound or with a compound with overlapping mechanism of action that impacts the novelty of a given proposal.
Information on original primary indications, already tested indications, ongoing and/or planned clinical studies for each of these ten compounds can be found in the topic text.
Expected Impact:
Achieving early proof-of-concept for new mechanisms with the potential to rapidly bring novel drugs to patients in areas of high unmet need and/or those with greatest disease burden;
Generation of ideas and/or data licensed from the research organisation, leading to further development of the compound in the new indication;
Added value by repurposing pharmaceutical assets which have already passed through several stages of the R&D process. This can offer significant time, cost and risk savings over embarking on discovery programmes with novel targets;
Supporting EU academic institutions to conduct well-designed and high standard translational and drug development research with quality compounds under GCP conditions, resulting in high impact publications and patents when possible;
Pooling of resources and greater collaboration between the public and private sectors, with the potential for pharmaceutical involvement or establishment of SMEs following in/out-licencing;
Boosting the discovery and development of therapeutics in the area of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes using a more cost-effective approach to drug development;
Advancing science and knowledge of disease (patho)physiology through testing of new hypothesis;
Boosting European competiveness by contributing to the establishment of closer links between industry and academia across the EU, and ensuring Europe is competitive in line with initiatives already in place in other leading scientific regions around the world."

More precisely, applicants are invited to submit proposals to utilise these assets to test their hypotheses, to generate clinical data and, if needed, prerequisite preclinical data, with the ultimate aim of taking these assets to the market in alternative indications to those that they were originally developed for.
Scope:
The overall objective of this pilot programme is to take one of the previously deprioritised clinical compounds and investigate their therapeutic potential in new clinical indications in the area of Respiratory diseases.
These compounds are listed in the topic text together with key information including mechanism of action, original indication, route of administration pharmacology, safety, tolerability and links to previous clinical studies and publications, to facilitate idea generation by investigators with hypotheses for novel uses. These compounds have all been through clinical phase 1 studies.
Proposals should cover clinical Phase 2A proof of concept studies, though larger Phase 2 studies are also in scope if these are within the budget. Clinical submissions should aim at moving towards the next stage of development and positive data should be a starting point for further investment into developing a drug towards clinic and regulatory approval;
If preclinical work is deemed necessary to provide additional support and confidence before moving into a clinical study in an alternative indication, proof-of-concept/feasibility preclinical studies of up to a year in duration can be included in the proposal. These studies should have clear go/no-go criteria for progressing in to the clinical phase of the project.
This programme intends to support only innovative clinical development for the compounds. This means that proposals for clinical development should not be considered in an indication which has been already tested (i.e. original primary indication or additional studies) or if there are already ongoing or planned clinical studies on identical or related disease indications with the compound or with a compound with overlapping mechanism of action that impacts the novelty of a given proposal.
Information on original primary indications, already tested indications, ongoing and/or planned clinical studies for each of these ten compounds can be found in the topic text.
Expected Impact:
Achieving early proof-of-concept for new mechanisms with the potential to rapidly bring novel drugs to patients in areas of high unmet need and/or those with greatest disease burden;
Generation of ideas and/or data licensed from the research organisation, leading to further development of the compound in the new indication;
Added value by repurposing pharmaceutical assets which have already passed through several stages of the R&D process. This can offer significant time, cost and risk savings over embarking on discovery programmes with novel targets;
Supporting EU academic institutions to conduct well-designed and high standard translational and drug development research with quality compounds under GCP conditions, resulting in high impact publications and patents when possible;
Pooling of resources and greater collaboration between the public and private sectors, with the potential for pharmaceutical involvement or establishment of SMEs following in/out-licencing;
Boosting the discovery and development of therapeutics in the area of Respiratory diseases using a more cost-effective approach to drug development;
Advancing science and knowledge of disease (patho)physiology through testing of new hypothesis;
Boosting European competiveness by contributing to the establishment of closer links between industry and academia across the EU, and ensuring Europe is competitive in line with initiatives already in place in other leading scientific regions around the world."

Neurotoxicity (used in the context of this document as “any adverse effect on the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS)”) is poorly predicted by preclinical studies performed on pharmaceuticals during research and development (R&D) process. As a consequence, adverse effects on nervous system are not uncommon during clinical development and post-marketing. This lack of predictability might have two types of consequences:
for human volunteers/patients, this can lead to a risk of adverse effects during clinical trials or even after marketing;
for the pharmaceutical industry, this can lead to substantial neurotoxicity-related attrition rates, generally at late stages (clinical phase 2 or 3); according to sources, the figures for this type of attrition are variable, but typically in the range of 5-25%.
Therefore, a better preclinical prediction of adverse effects on nervous system would benefit to human volunteers/patients (by safer drugs) and pharmaceutical industry (by increased productivity).
There is a clear need for a project to deliver on: (i) increased knowledge on mechanisms of neurotoxicity (e.g. establish adverse outcome pathway for each type of neurotoxicity); (ii) better understanding of factors that favour neurotoxicity (pharmacological targets and pathways, physico-chemical properties, pharmacokinetics); (iii) implementing new-found knowledge to improve the current preclinical toolbox, through a combination of high throughput, predictive in silico, in vitro and in vivo models, including safety biomarkers, where appropriate (iiii) combine these tools in an integrated risk assessment approach for better decision-points throughout R&D process, and better protection of human volunteers and patients.
Scope:
The objective of the project is to improve the preclinical predictivity of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on the central and peripheral nervous systems through increasing our knowledge on mechanisms of neurotoxicity and improving the experimental toolbox. The results would be an integrated prediction/evaluation approach that would include a combination of in silico, in vitro and in vivo models, including safety biomarkers (for peripheral neuropathies). This toolbox would increase the preclinical prediction of adverse effects of drugs throughout all aspects: identification of hazards, characterisation of mechanisms of toxicity, prediction of clinical consequences and possible follow-up in trials with safety biomarkers, and integrated risk-assessment approach for proper decision-making process.
Expected Impact:
At the level of R&D, regulatory, clinical and healthcare practice the impact would be (i) safer drugs for human volunteers/patients (ii) shortened development timelines, through reduced attrition, reduced testing, and shortened development plans:
improved subjects/patients safety during clinical trials and after marketing authorisation;
reduced attrition, especially at late stages of R&D (during clinical trials), for safety reasons related to neurotoxic effects;
reduced post-marketing events necessitating labelling changes;
reduced post-marketing events resulting in drug withdrawal;
greater R&D productivity/shorter timelines;
lower development costs.
In terms of ethics/animal welfare/3Rs, innovation and integration of new knowledge the impact would be:
replacement: whenever possible animal models would be replaced by in silico/in vitro models, provided they have at least the same level of prediction;
refinement and reduction: relevant biomarkers or any other appropriate endpoints would enrich current in vivo animal experiment and help (i) earlier detection and longitudinal follow-up of toxicities before inappropriate animal suffering (ii) decision-making process.
In terms of improving European citizens' health and wellbeing (volunteers and patients), the impact would be:
lower risk of neurotoxic events during clinical trials, whatever the clinical indication (relating to nervous system or not);
improved monitoring and risk minimisation procedures during clinical trials;
drugs with a better risk/benefit ratio.
In terms of industrial competitiveness the applicants should indicate how they will strengthen the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe by, for example, engaging suitable SMEs."

For full details of the topic, please refer to the call text
A large number of patients suffering from immune-mediated diseases fail to respond well or at all to current standard-of-care treatments or quickly relapse while on, or following, treatment. Currently, one of the most challenging questions in human immunology is to understand whether it is possible to accurately predict which patients will fail to respond to treatment, which patients will sustain a longer term treatment response, or which patients will suddenly flare up during periods of disease control. At present, there is a lack of a mechanistic understanding of non-response combined with an absence of biomarkers to predict clinical responses. Detailed analysis of clinical samples before and during treatment would enable breakthrough discoveries on the mechanisms, the clinical management of non-response, and the identification of patients prone to relapse. The topic addresses the challenge of translating insights from treatment non-response and disease exacerbation into new treatment paradigms at the individual patient level.
Scope:
For full details of the topic, please refer to the call text
The action generated by this topic aims to provide better control of immune-mediated diseases, in particular:
characterise human immune-mediated diseases;
profile and analyse immune cells obtained from non-blood tissues;
discover individual disease and cross-disease biomarkers predictive of treatment response, non-response, relapse and flare-up;
perform early phase clinical trials (e.g. enriched study populations for certain molecular pathways; adaptive and basket trial designs etc.) and identify potential novel patient-centric treatment approaches. The focus will be on patients from well-characterised immune-mediated diseases (SLE, RA, MS, UC, CD, Asthma and COPD).
The ultimate goal is to develop a translational research platform that will improve patient management and personalised treatment by identification/validation of predictive biomarkers for non-response, rapid progression and remission. This would lead to an increased likelihood of treatment success with decreased costs for both patients & society and pharmaceutical companies.
Expected Impact:

The proposed precision-immunology approach is expected to achieve a reduction in failure rates in early clinical trials and to provide access for novel therapeutics to the most appropriate patient populations. Insights gained from this study will inform the design of platform trials for single indications with multiple mechanisms, further supporting precision medicine approaches. In addition, a more accurate definition of subcategories of auto-immune disorders and their responses to particular therapies on an individual patient level will fuel novel target discovery, decrease phase 2 proof of concept (POC) attrition, and decrease the costs of development to achieve regulatory approval and appropriate reimbursement.
To this end, the action generated by this topic would be a powerful and unique instrument, with the capability to significantly move forward the development of a consensus on the best treatment options for defined subgroups of patients with high unmet medical needs, such as patients suffering from immune-mediated diseases. Furthermore, beyond advancing our understanding of the disease, informing personalised approaches to patient care, and delivering potential novel treatments, the topic has the potential to establish Europe in a leadership position in this field of biology and medicine.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can be of great benefit to IMI2 JU projects. Their involvement in the action might offer a complementary perspective to industry and academia, and help deliver the long-term impact of the action."

Current pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments of immune cells are based on peripheral blood biomarkers, or from biopsy samples which are acquired by invasive procedures. Some existing medical imaging modalities provide a quantifiable, non-invasive, repeatable and localised measure of biological processes in the living body. However, current methodology and technology provides limited information on time-dependent and disease-specific relevant immune cell subpopulations and compartments types, or measures of direct engagement of immune targets.
Imaging tracers designed to bind specific immune cells (‘immunotracers’) or targets within immune-mediated pathways would enable the clinical imaging of the target immune cell subtypes and immune markers of disease in a clinical setting, which in turn would provide in vivo insights into effects of immunomodulatory therapies at disease sites (organs/tissues) and improve knowledge about the pathophysiology of various immune-mediated diseases.
Molecular imaging agents, (hybrid) imaging modalities, and image processing algorithms to image immune cells in vivo are advancing within the imaging field and can provide an immediate, non-invasive read-out of target expression over time. However, further novel imaging agents and technologies will need to be developed in order to extend the applicability of immune cell imaging to additional disease areas, additional tissue sites, and/or immune cell subpopulations especially by increasing the specificity of imaging agents. Therefore, there remains a need to better understand the currently available markers and validate them extensively for clinical use.

This topic aims to establish a consortium that can develop and validate a quantitative, non-invasive, immune cell imaging platform, which includes novel and target-specific molecular imaging agents, (hybrid) imaging modalities, and image processing algorithms. The topic aligns with the IMI2 Strategic Research Agenda, as it aims to validate immune cell targets based on human biology and to facilitate precision medicine by identification and stratification of patients and prediction of therapeutic outcomes. In addition, it is expected that these agents will facilitate early diagnosis of the disease and/or classification of disease based on the immune phenotype.
Expected Impact:

Molecular imaging of immune cells could provide an early indicator of whether patients are likely to benefit from a given (immuno-) therapeutic intervention (surrogate of response). The technology to be delivered is expected to have the potential to also provide information for tissue/organ sites that are not biopsy-accessible, thus representing a significant advance in the assessment of the immune marker status for the relevant indications. Patients can be stratified by marker expression, with the potential to offer the most appropriate treatment and thereby reduce the implementation of treatment regimens that are unlikely to be efficacious and would therefore have a negative benefit-risk profile for the individual patient (personalised
By visualising and quantifying the impact of therapy on specific target sites and related immune-mediated pathways, the planned technology is also expected to reduce ambiguity in the evaluation of efficacy during clinical trials (e.g. provide early indications of patient responses, assessment of variability between and within individuals, facilitate proof of mechanism (POM) and proof of concept (POC) studies of new mechanisms). Spatio-temporal complexity can be studied due to longitudinal imaging capabilities.
Furthermore, it will have significant impact on personalised approaches to detect and better monitor these diseases already in the early and better treatable stages. It will support and guide physicians and patients in determining the most appropriate care, leading to improved efficiency in the health care system and patient benefits. It is envisioned that the topic will ultimately result in the regulatory acceptance of standardised protocols with validated immune-imaging approaches. Consequently, those approaches will significantly reduce the time and cost of clinical trials.

Despite good progress in many areas of healthcare, it seems that clinical development rather than discovery research is the limiting factor for innovative new products and treatment options to reach patients.
Root causes of this include (i) siloed and competitive development process focussed on single compounds with transient clinical trial infrastructures, (ii) insufficient collaboration among industry and between industry, not-for-profit product developers and academia, (iii) limited patient-centric alignment of stakeholders, and, (iv) in general, the limited focus on individual patient-tailored treatments.
As a result of these, there is a clear shortage of (i) investigators & investigational sites for phase 2-3 clinical trials, (ii) patients for enrolment in such trials, (iii) sharing of insights and use of real-world data, and (iv) investigations of combination treatments, in particular from different sponsors.
Scope:
The action aims to address these issues by creating, in a collaborative rather than competitive manner, a reusable and modular approach for the design and execution of patient-centric platform trials.
It will create best practices, tools and guidelines for establishing multi-company platform trials by leveraging, extending and improving concepts from previous pioneering multi-company platform trials to new disease areas.
The proposal is divided into (i) a set of common foundational elements applicable to all disease areas, (ii) clinical networks and networks of patient-level data and (iii) disease-specific integrated research platforms in several disease areas: major depressive disorder (MDD), tuberculosis (TB), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and neurofibromatosis (NF).
Expected Impact:
Developing the proposed reusable IRP and platform trial approach in Europe will deliver a tangible advantage for developing innovative new medicines, and for advancing fundamental and applied medicines research in general, in academia and industry. This includes four platform trial protocols fully ready for execution for diseases of high unmet need in scope of the World Health Organisation (WHO) priority medicines list.
This will allow patients to benefit quicker from medical innovations, both through accelerating new medicines development in general but also through faster enrolment in clinical trials with a lower chance of being randomised to the placebo, and potentially a higher likelihood of being allocated to the most promising treatments for individual patients, including multi-company combinations of medicines.
It will also increase participation of patients in the design of clinical trials and in the development of predictive biomarkers and trial endpoints that are clinically meaningful and approved by regulators."

counterfeit medicines market estimated at EUR 160 billion with a huge impact on patient health;
lack of access to medicines, especially in developing countries, impacting patient health;
data accessibility leading to lost opportunities for improved research and new innovative medicines;
patient privacy considerations (patient consent) hindering clinical trial recruitment and execution;
lack of visibility and shared ’source of truth’ leading to friction and costs in development and distribution;
increasing risk of cyber threats, especially with central data storage and sharing.
By addressing these challenges through a public-private consortium, the evaluation, design, and accelerated adoption of blockchain-enabled healthcare solutions across the industry can be fostered. This will facilitate the delivery of true innovation benefiting both patients and the industry.
Scope:
The overall objective of the agile project generated by this topic is to establish a common blockchain ecosystem for pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and distribution that provides an incentive and serves as the basis for all participants to engage, adopt, and benefit from.
The project will initially establish an effective governance organisation and approach to enable continuous improvement and open competition among service providers, while ensuring that critical factors such as data integrity, privacy, regulatory compliance and efficiency are built into a ‘Healthcare Foundation’ which serves as an integration layer between underlying blockchain technologies and the business application layer (see architecture diagram).

The project aims to drive the agile delivery of use cases prioritised by clearly defined business value, benefits (return on investment, ROI) and feasibility. Use cases fall into the domains of supply chain, focusing on supply chain integrity and efficiency; clinical development, focusing on clinical trials and submission; and health data, which among others should enable blockchain-based machine learning data marketplaces. A likely focus for prioritised delivery is enabling end-to-end product tracking with blockchain technology to address the issue of counterfeit medicines, taking into account existing initiatives such as the proposed European Medicines Verification System. The project will also evaluate the use of medical devices across multiple use cases in order to ensure the integrity of device, data and services to enable the benefits of the internet of things (IoT). The initial technology deliverable is an architectural framework enabling such factors as digital identity management, efficient consensus mechanism, off-chain storage, global scalability, security, and high performance. Other use cases can be added based on a value analysis during the project lifetime and proposals from the selected applicant consortium. The scope includes a reference implementation of the solution but does not include specific industry partner implementations.
Expected Impact:
The project generated by this topic will generally position the industry as a leader in innovation and serve to improve the overall trust and reputation of participants. Full realisation of the envisioned benefits will require a transformation of many core processes in organisations over several years beyond the life of the project. The project will establish a strong foundation to enable these benefits in accelerated manner. Envisioned long term benefits include:
Patients will have earlier access to both the medicines they need and information on drug provenance; this will improve overall transparency, and with it trust in and the reputation of the industry. The supply chain will be more secure through anti-counterfeiting measures, building on the solutions designed to fulfil the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD). The project will evaluate and define additional potential patient-centric services.
Permissioned and secure healthcare data sharing will be enabled between patients, healthcare providers, researchers and other stakeholders. Patients will have full control of their health data and be able to join clinical, sensor and behavioural data into a self-sovereign 360 degree health record. Patients will be able to donate data or grant access to their data for a defined / limited time or purpose to research and real world registries in a trusted and anonymous manner. If seeking information on clinical trials, patients will have recommendations made to them based on their health profiles.
Healthcare providers will use limited resources more efficiently by streamlining clinical trials and eliminating expenses for counterfeit and substandard medicines. Automation of processes and reliability of data will enable significant improvements to the current status quo.
The pharmaceutical industry will benefit from widely accepted standards and demonstrated actions to ensure the integrity of drug development and distribution to the patient. Accelerated adoption of digital technology will additionally result in efficiencies across the industry with improved transparency, visibility and availability of drugs to the market. It can also better position the industry for new innovative therapies relying on the patient’s own cells (chain of identity).
The applicant consortium will benefit from investments in research programmes and early adoption of innovative solutions.
Applicants should indicate how their proposal will impact the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe by, for example engaging suitable SMEs."

There is an urgent need to better understand inherent risks of innovative therapeutics for immuno-oncology and immuno-inflammatory disease indications including cytokine release syndrome, infection, malignancy and autoimmunity during early (non-clinical) stages of drug development. The toxicities induced by immunomodulatory therapeutics in patients are often not detected in the young healthy animal models that are routinely used for toxicology studies either due the lack of expression of appropriate drug targets/pathways or due to differences in drug target genetics, expression and functions between animal models and the intended patient populations. Thus, innovative translational safety assessment tools, technologies, models and resources are needed to facilitate the development of novel immunomodulatory drugs (either immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive).
Scope:
For full details of the topic, please see the call text on the IMI website.
This topic aims to establish a public-private consortium that will enhance translational safety assessment approaches for immunomodulatory therapeutics (spanning oncology and non-oncology indications), with an emphasis on evaluating human-relevance.
The following objectives are within the scope of this proposal:
development of innovative comparative (cross-species) in situ and ex vivo molecular, biochemical tools and cellular profiling of immune cells (including patient-derived clinical samples) and association with functional/phenotypic endpoints to enable;
establishment, refinement and validation of non-clinical tools and models to enable the development of novel classes of immunomodulatory medicines supporting in vitro-in vivo and cross-species translation.
Expected Impact:
For full details of the topic, please see the call text on the IMI website.
The action generated by this topic will ultimately help deliver safer medicines to patients via:
provision of new tools and models to enable a better understanding of the inherent safety risks of immunomodulatory therapeutics;
improvement of drug development processes and regulatory assessments for immunomodulatory therapeutics;
better definition of limitations in the translatability of non-clinical test systems to patients and will also contribute to the principles of the 3Rs.

Enabled by an ever-expanding arsenal of model systems, analysis methods, libraries of chemical compounds and other agents (like biologics), the amount of data generated during drug discovery programmes has never been greater, yet the biological complexity of many diseases still defies pharmaceutical treatment. Hand in hand with rising regulatory expectations, this growing complexity has inflated the research intensity and associated cost of the average discovery project. It is, therefore, imperative that the learnings from these data investments are maximised to enable efficient future research. This could be empowered by the big data analysis and machine learning approaches that are currently driving the digital transformation across all industries.

The delivery of a federated and privacy-preserving machine learning platform, initially validated on publicly accessible data, that is demonstrably safe enough (privacy-preserving in the face of legitimate and illegitimate (attempted) access and use) and scalable enough to be deployed to a significant representation of private data in the actual preclinical data warehouses of the participating major pharmaceutical companies in yearly evaluation runs. This effort will be mainly driven by the applicant consortium and enabled by the EFPIA partners.
Expected Impact:
For full details of the topic, please refer to the call text
The in silico predictions from the platform developed within the project will increasingly replace the costly and time-consuming in vitro testing, resulting in cost and time savings on compound synthesis and measurement in assays and preclinical studies, and therefore increase the efficiency of pharmaceutical discovery research. Although out of the direct scope of the present topic, the application of similar concepts to clinical data to enable faster recruitment of more targeted patients holds the longer-term promise of reducing costs of development.
The concepts developed within the project will be generic and will apply not only to the pharmaceutical discovery and clinical development setting, but also to other clinical applications, including real-world evidence analysis. Beyond the health area, they will prove relevant to multiple alternative industrial and other commercial or non-commercial settings where parties are interested in different predictive models that benefit from indirect access to the same volumes of private data. By providing data owners with the confidence that their data and the corresponding predictive models will remain private, this project will facilitate access to much larger data sets and therefore improve performance over that of conventional machine learning approaches.
For knowledge and ICT partners, federated learning presents a line of research and product development beyond that of data federation.

","18 July 2018
","15 May 2019","Specific Challenge:
Biological therapies have provided significant therapeutic benefit to patients with immuno-inflammatory diseases, but many patients fail to respond completely and efficacy is lost in many patients over time. The tissue microenvironment interacts with and influences immune cells to form functional cellular niches that play a role not only in the onset and progression of disease but also in the response to therapy. Inaccessible tissue and invasive biopsy procedures have prevented in-depth interrogation of these microenvironments, resulting in a major gap in our basic understanding of immune cell action mechanisms. Therefore, how they interact with each other and their environment, and how they can be monitored and pharmacologically manipulated to better control disease, remain elusive.
This topic aims to profile tissue-specific microenvironments to improve knowledge of pathophysiology of various immune-mediated diseases (such as inflammatory bowel disease: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis; and skin related diseases e.g. atopic dermatitis, cutaneous lupus, psoriasis) and identify signatures that can be correlated in body fluids (i.e. blood), ‘circulating signatures’, to inform on disease progression and to monitor treatment.
Scope:
The ultimate goal to be achieved by the consortium is to identify key organ and disease-specific signatures with correlates in body fluids that may predict disease, track progression and/or therapeutic response. These signatures will enable tailored treatment pathways to the disease mechanism and ultimately provide superior therapeutic benefit to patients.
In order to achieve the ambitious overall objective, a set of specific objectives should be addressed by the applicants.
1. Identify and evolve the state-of-the-art novel technologies to interrogate both immune and non-immune cells in target tissues at single cell level to better understand pathways regulating disease and to define tissue/disease-specific signatures, which can be correlated in peripheral blood. The technologies for the identified signature need to be adaptable and of sufficient robustness for use in clinical trial.
2. Evaluate above technologies in existing clinical retrospective cohorts as well as samples from ongoing clinical trials made accessible by both academic and industry partners.
3. Perform a bespoke, enabling clinical study to verify signatures. This will be a non-interventional prospective study, run as a collaborative effort between industry and academic partners.
Expected Impact:
In-depth characterisation of the tissue microenvironment will provide better disease understanding, which represents a significant advance in the assessment of both immune and non-immune markers in relevant diseases. The signatures, but potentially also the relevant (novel) underlying technology, will advance clinical monitoring in both clinical trials and standard patient care. These tools will allow earlier detection of disease progression or identify patients at risk and therefore will allow earlier or more tailored treatment. In clinical trials, these less invasive tools will allow better or earlier detection of treatment response, but may also allow better patient stratification and prediction of treatment response. The proposed non-interventional clinical study will allow verification of signatures and facilitate the implementation of these signatures as decision-making tools for other clinical studies. The less invasive nature of the detection of these signatures is highly attractive, as it will significantly reduce the burden to patients in clinical trials and can complement diagnosis.
The multi-partner, multi-stakeholder and cross-sector approach of this consortium will also allow for a more standardised future adoption of these signatures across industry and pave the way for regulatory approval of improved, clinically relevant tools to monitor disease progression.
Applicants should indicate how their proposal will impact the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe by, for example engaging suitable SMEs. In particular, the inclusion of SMEs into the consortium will maximise the opportunity for suitable technology for the identification of disease-specific signatures of the tissue microenvironment to be identified and, more importantly, ultimately implemented in multi-centre clinical trial settings under good laboratory practice (GLP) conditions."

Developing new medicines/health solutions and improving patient health rely on the successful conduct of clinical trials to generate relevant safety and efficacy data. Recruitment and retention of patients are some of the most challenging aspects in clinical trial protocol adherence. The 2017-global CISCRP survey reported the main barriers to patients’ participation as “lack of patients’ awareness of clinical trials” (~61%); and the “geography and the distance to the clinical site” (60%) . This geographical burden on patients, including the duration and number of clinical visits, also drives their decision to participate in a trial. In addition, within patients who consent, an alarming 30% dropout across all clinical trials is observed. Therefore, by the same token, improving the patients’ experience through protocol optimisation to ease the patient burden, whether perceived or real, should improve data quality and increase the probability of success.

Although pathology is the cornerstone of the workup of many diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and transplant rejection, it still relies heavily on the subjective interpretation of a histology sample by a qualified pathologist who captures observations and conclusions in a report. Once the observations are captured, the slides are archived and only the pathologist’s report and diagnoses (considered as raw data in good laboratory practice (GLP) nonclinical studies) remain accessible. Therefore, significant information from the histology slides is no longer easily available. This hinders the discovery of new clinico-pathological entities that are relevant to patients’ prognosis and treatment.
The recent developments of high-throughput slide scanners offer a possibility for making the entire information contained in the millions of glass slides produced every year, available for search. Ensuring storage and access to digital slides will overcome the current limitations to accessing and sharing pathology material together with the associated metadata. It will facilitate case consultation, help identify sub-types of diseases, assess the translatability of nonclinical safety observations and animal models, and thereby rationalise the design of clinical trials and the use of animal models.
Scope:
The overall scope of the Call topic is to collect, host and sustain virtual slides along with associated data and to support the collaborative development of artificial intelligence in pathology.
The funded action will also address the regulatory, legal and ethical challenges associated with the collection, sharing and mining of the virtual slides.
Objective 1: Sustainable infrastructure
To deliver the infrastructure hosting several petabytes of digital slides and making the data accessible for research. It represents the hardware layer of the funded action and could take the form of a data centre, either centralised or decentralised. The key factors of success for this objective are the storage capacity and the possibility to exchange rapidly large amounts of data.
Objective 2: Data
To compile digital histopathology slides from nonclinical safety studies, as well as from clinical series needed to populate the initial version of the repository, and contribute to developing tools and artificial intelligence models. The key factor of success is the diversity of lesions, tissues, and species while providing sufficient sample sizes. In addition, the slides will be made publicly available for the development of artificial intelligence in pathology in line with the sustainability model described in objective 1.
Objective 3: Tools
To deliver a mechanism of an honest broker (see ‘Expected key deliverables’ and ’Suggested architecture of the full proposal’ sections) by developing a software ensuring the optimal and secure contribution of clinical and nonclinical material. Efforts will also be undertaken to propose a unified open digital slide format and tools to search, access, upload, register, download, view and homogeneously annotate information. In addition, AI models and tools, such as assistance to general diagnosis, screening for slides for lesions, and content-based image retrieval will be developed at a later stage of the funded action.
Objective 4: Regulatory framework
To advance the regulatory framework around the utilisation of digital pathology slides for nonclinical safety testing, evaluation of clinical trials and dissemination/discussion of difficult clinical cases. This will accelerate the adoption of roadmaps for the qualification of the usage of digital slides for peer-review or primary slide reading, as well for the development of artificial intelligence based tools for pre-screening and assisted diagnosis. This objective should be achieved by building on already existing and ongoing interactions and efforts between health and regulatory authorities, and professional societies.
Expected Impact:
Applicants should describe how the outputs of the project would contribute to the following impacts and include baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact:
Catalyse research in digital pathology by providing a unique combination of animal and human histopathology. By offering the first complete coverage of tissues and elementary lesions, this repository will offer an unprecedented opportunity to build holistic models and allow generic mining of histopathology, irrespective of a particular tissue or indication.
Enable the development of artificial intelligence tools for rare diseases and uncommon conditions, which currently are left out of the models because of the paucity of cases.
Help identify sub-types in common diseases, possibly unveiling new clinico-pathological entities amenable to specific therapeutic interventions. It could also contribute to assessing the translatability of animal models for disease modelling, safety and efficacy studies, and thereby rationalise the design of clinical trials and the use of animal models. Ultimately, it should accelerate and improve patient treatment and management, thereby enhancing patient health along with the more efficient use of healthcare resources.
Clear the way for the use of digital slides in nonclinical safety and clinical consultation, and facilitate the approval of AI-based tools for slide screening and assisted diagnosis.
In the long term, the repository delivered by the consortium will be maintained through sustainability mechanisms defined by the consortium and will provide the community with an infrastructure to host additional digital slides (e.g. associated with the publication of case reports, cases series for disease stratification and clinical trials).
Applicants should indicate how their proposal will impact the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe by, for example engaging suitable SMEs."

Pharmaceuticals are present in the environment as a consequence of patient use, manufacture, and improper disposal. They predominantly enter the aquatic environment via patient use. In the European Union (EU) an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is required as part of the marketing application and approval for new drugs. Currently the ERA is conducted late in drug development and often parallel to Phase III clinical trials and after significant investment.
The growing regulatory and scientific concerns regarding pharmaceuticals in the environment have reached the point where some stakeholders are advocating:
the inclusion of environmental hazard and risk within the patient-benefit evaluation that underpins the marketing authorisation of a drug;
a catch-up scheme for medicines authorised for use prior to 2006 that lack comprehensive environmental assessments;
increased transparency of environmental data;
increased consideration of environmental properties in drug development (i.e. greener drug design).
However, without validated tools to predict environmental risk earlier in drug development these stakeholder expectations could impact the availability of life-changing medicines to patients within Europe and impact the competitiveness of the industry.
For complete information, please see the IMI2 Call 17 topic text.
Scope:
The overall aim of this project is to apply innovative approaches to ensure the environmental safety of human medicinal products such that both (i) environmental concerns do not become a barrier to patient access to medicines, and (ii) the intended use of medicines does not pose an unacceptable risk to the environment.
This project aims to refine, extend, validate and implement approaches to the prioritisation and testing of new APIs to ensure the environmental safety of established medicinal products.
For complete information, please see the IMI2 Call 17 topic text.
Expected Impact:
This project aims to develop an EU-wide pharmaceutical ecotoxicology database which will:
help all stakeholders better understand the risks posed to the environment by human medicinal products;
allow environmental chemists to present their monitoring work in the context of risk;
reduce duplication of environmental testing across the industry. The database will also enable the environmental risks of a human medicinal product to be actively managed across its product life cycle and help facilitate the industry extended environmental risk assessment (eERA) model.
The availability of tools and models has the potential to deliver significant animal welfare benefits and cost savings without compromising environmental protection, for example, the pharmaceutical industry could save more than EUR 500 million.

Numerous efforts have been undertaken to standardise the way HRQOL and PRO data are conducted and reported in cancer clinical trials. These include recommendations to standardise reporting and drafting of clinical trials, translations in clinical trials, and how to develop and standardise measures for use in clinical trials. However, there are no agreed standards on how to analyse HRQOL and PRO data in clinical trials and subsequently, interpret the findings. The various ways data are analysed and interpreted make it difficult to compare results across trials, and hinder the application of research findings to inform physicians, patients, caregivers, policy makers, reimbursement authorities and other stakeholders. Lack of standardisation can lead to variation in the analysis of results and could result in two near-identical trials being analysed in different ways, leading to potential differences in data interpretation.
A number of systematic reviews from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have highlighted the current lack of standardisation in this field and reported the following key findings:
a lack of clear HRQOL and PRO research objectives;
a lack of standardisation of basic statistical terms such as compliance and completion rates;
the use of suboptimal statistical practices and a variety of statistical methods not well justified with respect to analysing HRQOL and PRO data;
the use of a variety of approaches to handling missing data.
There is an urgent need to develop clear standards and guidelines, endorsed by a broad range of stakeholders, to improve how HRQOL and PRO data are analysed in cancer clinical trials. This would also help promote HRQOL and PROs as potential primary or co-primary endpoints (when relevant) in cancer clinical trials. Such standards will support the full use and understanding of HRQOL and PROs in drug development and drug and device approval by regulators and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, but importantly it will also support better communication of PRO results to clinicians and patients with the potential to inform and improve shared decision-making.
Scope:
The scope of this Call topic is to develop recommendations for the different analyses and interpretations of HRQOL and PRO endpoints in cancer clinical trials that will be tailored towards addressing specific research objectives within each clinical trial. This Call topic aims for a global scope and is of strong interest to individuals from various regulatory and HTA bodies, key cancer organisations, the pharmaceutical industry, specialised vendor organisations, academic societies and international patient organisations. The buy-in of these various key stakeholders is crucial, as this will help identify a set of similar expectations, facilitate the implementation of these recommendations, and harmonise the analysis and interpretation of HRQOL and PRO data on a global scale.
The main objectives are to:
achieve international consensus, across stakeholders, on the optimal use of HRQOL and PRO data in cancer clinical trials;
improve the quality of statistical analysis of HRQOL and PRO data in cancer clinical trials;
improve the standards of reporting of HRQOL and PRO data, and as such the interpretability of the data. It is hoped that this will result in more reliable interpretation, and ultimately faster dissemination, of HRQOL and PRO findings, as well as cross-referencing within and between different cancer settings, whenever this is deemed feasible.
Expected Impact:
A consensus and clear set of agreed methodological recommendations for the statistical analysis of HRQOL and PRO data in cancer studies will improve their interpretability. This is an important prerequisite for better adoption and increased use of these outcomes in various decision-making contexts (regulatory approval, HTA/reimbursement decisions, shared decision making between physicians and patients). Importantly, the expected outcomes of this initiative will be of mutual benefit to all stakeholders involved, including the most important beneficiary of healthcare, the patient. Reaching a broad international consensus is a prerequisite for a broader adoption of HRQOL and PRO data and is likely to result in:
more reliable findings and faster dissemination of HRQOL and PRO data in cancer studies;
advances in statistical science and improved statistical practice in cancer studies;
improved interpretability of the data because of greater familiarity with standardised reporting;
broader use and adoption of PRO data to inform benefit-risk evaluation in regulatory appraisals, added benefit evaluation in HTAs and reimbursement decision processes as well as shared treatment decision making contexts;
better and improved shared decision making between patients and their treating physicians which may lead to improved patient satisfaction, an increased likelihood of adherence to treatment, higher likelihood of treatment success and a reduction in health‐care cost;
better and more efficient use of increasingly finite research and healthcare funding;
improved and more efficient clinical trial designs that also investigate the cancer patient perspective on treatment outcomes.

Curative or near curative therapies for rare and orphan diseases have been a long-held desire for many in the biomedical research and development arena, including patients. Rare diseases are often very severe, genetically driven illnesses with high morbidity and mortality that place a large burden on families of patients and healthcare systems. Gene therapy and cell therapy provide an opportunity for a curative, single treatment for many of these devastating diseases, eliminating the need for chronic treatment. This topic aims to accelerate the research and development of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) by filling gaps in our knowledge base in, and tools for, gene and cell therapy. This will provide medicines developers and regulators with the information they need to more swiftly move these potentially transformative medicines forward so that they can benefit patients in need.
Conventional medicinal product characterisation, clinical safety/efficacy, and regulatory requirements already pose challenges to developing treatments for rare monogenic diseases. These challenges are amplified for gene and cell therapies due to knowledge gaps in our understanding of these ATMPs for viral or non-viral approaches. By addressing these existing knowledge gaps, we hope to accelerate and improve the feasibility of product development and decrease development time and costs to bring effective new advanced therapies to patients. For many aspects of ATMP biology and safety, regulatory agencies have to consider theoretical concerns in this emerging field, largely due to a lack of supporting data and evidence. This can be a major burden for the efficient development of ATMPs.
Scope:
The main focus of this topic is to develop a product characterisation framework and methodologies that are limited to the pre-competitive space. Though much of the work will be to understand aspects of gene or cell therapy in general without a particular disease focus, there may be some work that utilises disease models to accomplish the appropriate characterisation. The disease focus will be on non-oncological, monogenic rare diseases. Therefore, this topic intends to utilise both therapeutically relevant systems, as well as model systems that rely on the use of marker transgenes. In order to develop such a framework, there is a need for a coordinated and substantive effort to acquire and analyse the currently available data and then design preclinical and clinical studies to fill the knowledge gaps. This information will help to address gene/cell therapy risks and also guide product developers and regulators to determine and implement an appropriate and effective characterisation framework to enable efficient and safe development of gene/cell therapies.
The main objectives of the topic, intended to address existing knowledge/data and tools gaps focused on viral-mediated gene therapy and cell therapy, are to:
1) develop better, standardised models for predicting product immunogenicity in humans;
2) build our understanding of gene/cell therapy drug metabolism inside a host and explore any loss of efficacy (persistence), particularly with non-integrating viral vectors or cell therapy;
3) understand the clinical factors around pre-existing immunity limiting patient access to ATMP therapy, and adaptive immune responses affecting product safety, efficacy and persistence, including for integrating vectors-based therapies;
4) engage regulators to ensure that the models and data generated through the funded action will provide the necessary information to support regulatory filings and to address regulatory and safety concerns.
Expected Impact:
Primarily, the action funded under this topic will fill gaps in our knowledge base around gene/cell therapy host responses, which will allow for the data-driven development of a product characterisation framework to aid researchers, developers and regulators to more rapidly move effective and safe gene/cell therapies forward.
Understanding the host immune responses and the prevalence of pre-existing immunity in humans in broad geographic areas will be instrumental for finding the best immune-modulating regimens, thus increasing patient access to advanced medicines. Understanding the determinants of immunogenicity may enable re-dosing with gene/cell therapy products, while studying the mechanisms of persistence will help to define the optimal age for gene/cell therapy intervention.
Finally, joint efforts across pharma, biotech, academia, and regulatory functions will inform patient inclusion criteria, limit sub-therapeutic dosing, and define the impact of the pre-existing and adaptive immunity on the efficacy and persistence of gene/cell therapy. This broad understanding will help to focus industry resources on actual (not theoretical) risks and will facilitate the harmonisation of regulatory requirements. These improvements will, in turn, enable accelerated cures for rare diseases via a defined regulatory framework."

Engineered T cells, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T-cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells, combine features of cell therapy, gene therapy, and immunotherapy. With two distinct autologous CD19 CAR-T-cell therapies approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018, cellular immunotherapy is emerging as a promising new treatment modality for a broad range of cancers. Allogeneic approaches are also being developed in order to overcome some of the challenges of autologous therapies. Although CAR-T-cell therapies have been largely successful in treating haematological malignancies, they have not been as effective in treating solid tumours.
These complex medicinal products have been associated with unique specific acute toxicities, with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity being two most commonly observed toxicities. Animal models often fail to predict toxicities associated with the use of CAR-T cells and frequently overestimate the efficacy of the treatment, as they do not accurately reflect the tumour microenvironment (TME). Although new mouse models have recently been shown to be able to recapitulate human efficacy, CRS and neurotoxicity of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, efforts are still needed to optimise and extend these models to other tumour antigens. The use of alternative, non-genotoxic and non-myeloablative methods to induce lymphodepletion or better schemes for administrating existing regimens may also contribute to decreased toxicity associated with engineered T cells.
The need for good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant manufacturing may also constitute a specific hurdle in the timely translation to the clinic. Issues may be related to the consistency of clinical batches, the characterisation of the final product, and definition and evaluation of specific potency criteria. The standardisation of analytical procedures would improve comparability of CAR-T-cell batches and of clinical results from patients included in different trials and/or receiving CAR-T cells from different origins.
Scope:
The overall objective of the call topic is to support the development of autologous and allogeneic engineered T-cell therapies, including CAR and TCR engineered T cells. The Call topic addresses both haematological and solid tumours.
- Optimisation of existing pre-clinical models, tools and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers to predict toxicities associated with engineered T cells. Development of new models and tools if needed.
- Optimisation of existing pre-clinical models, tools and PD markers to predict the efficacy of engineered T cells.
- Comparison of existing analytical methods used pre- and post-infusion of engineered T cells to define gold standard methods. New technologies may also be developed.
- Creation of a database with historical existing clinical and biological data from patients receiving lymphodepleting regimens. Development of relevant in vivo models to evaluate new lymphodepleting regimens.
- Expert discussion on the implementation of regulatory guidance for engineered T cells.
- Development of communication tools for patients and healthcare providers on engineered T cells.
- Expert discussion on the best path to ensure broad patient access to engineered T cells.
Expected Impact:
At the levels of the R&D process, regulatory pathways and/or health technology assessment (HTA), patient access processes, clinical and healthcare practices, the impact would be:
the development of safer and more effective engineered T-cell therapies;
the opportunity to compare data generated from standardised analytical methods;
increased industrial competitiveness;
broader patient access to engineered T-cell therapies;
an increased awareness among HCPs of patients’ concerns.
In addition, patients will benefit from the project outputs by:
better understanding the mode of action and procedures of their treatment;
having a better consideration of their perspectives by being a key actor of the whole R&D process;
acilitated interactions with HCPs.
For society, the impact could be:
a better understanding of these complex therapies by the public (complexity, efficacy and safety);
a better understanding and evidence-based development of engineered T cells might also contribute to decreasing their cost;
improved synergies between industry, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and academic organisations."

1. Patient outcomes and their experience of healthcare, and thus their overall care, could be improved through systematic capture of the patient voice and perspective.
It is important to complement existing clinical outcome measurements with patient-generated measures of disease and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) to ensure that the patient perspective of disease and the impact of healthcare interventions are more completely captured and that disease heterogeneity is better understood.
In order to achieve this, it is essential to provide patients with tools that have the ability to better capture the entirety of the impact of a disease and treatments (e.g. signs, symptoms, tolerability), allowing them to document their disease more completely and in a structured manner. To be effective, these tools should be built on the basis of accepted standards, developed in partnership with all relevant stakeholders and accepted and integrated into the existing healthcare ecosystem.
2. A reward system that truly focuses on value requires measurement and transparency of patient outcomes.
At the level of the individual patient, the data generated, once structured and subjected to a degree of standardisation, will enable patients to have more productive interactions with their healthcare provider. At the level of the healthcare system, this data will allow a systematic measurement of health outcomes and the possibility to set up a reward system based on value – which can be defined as the level of health outcomes achieved for a given cost.
3. There is a lack of models for capturing and managing patient-reported health data in an ethical and sustainable way.
Structured health data is invaluable for all stakeholders, from the individual patient, healthcare professionals (HCPs), the life science industry, and policy makers to the patient advocacy groups. There have been a few successful examples of approaches to integrate patient-reported health data into clinical care. In an era of greater focus on the patient, it is thus critical for a society that patient-reported health and experience data is captured and managed in an ethical manner ensuring broad and appropriate access while safeguarding patients’ privacy and building high levels of trust.
Scope:
The main goals are:
1. Identify appropriate standards for capturing the patient perspective when measuring health outcomes and patients’ experience of healthcare, and obtain support for these standards among relevant stakeholders.
2. Implement appropriate technology solutions (including adopting existing technology where appropriate) that would allow individual patients to record and measure their outcomes according to these standards and use the information for a more structured dialogue with their HCPs.
3. Establish the appropriate platform to collect, process and manage data in the best interest of patients, patient organisations, health authorities, healthcare professionals, the research community and health care payers.
4. Create a sustainable, socially acceptable and ethical model for the continuous collection of data and an appropriate model for providing access to the identifiable or anonymised or aggregated data to researchers with a legitimate interest in analysing them.
These goals can be achieved through the creation of health outcomes observatories in three selected disease areas: diabetes type 1 and 2, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer (side effects of chemotherapy and immune-oncology). The observatories will collect health data in at least three different European countries for each disease area.
Expected Impact:
1. Enable individual patients to:
receive close to real-time information on their disease status;
hold more informed discussions with healthcare professionals about their health status and options;
better understand how their status compares with other patients with a similar condition;
share their data and help the broader patient community.
2. Allow healthcare professionals to:
track the evolution of their patients;
enable a different outcome-based conversation;
better inform and enhance clinical decisions based on the patient perspective.
3. Allow patient organisations to:
assess the status and dynamics of their patient population;
increase engagement with other healthcare stakeholders in evidence-based advocacy;
further contribute to improving the healthcare system.
4. Allow health authorities and healthcare providers to:
improve the quality of care through better and more transparent evidence of patient measures and outcomes;
drive research agendas and investments in the right areas;
ensure the sustainability of healthcare systems in finding ways to improve the allocation of resources.
5. Allow pharmaceutical companies and other innovative companies to use data to:
enable ethical utilisation of the observatory data as legally appropriate;
generate insights that can be used to support the design and direction of the development of new treatments;
generate robust evidence that can be used in submissions to regulators, health technology assessment (HTA) agencies and other decision makers."

","26 June 2019
","02 April 2020","Specific Challenge:
The ability to access and understand high-quality health information is central to health literacy, and this affects the day-to-day decisions citizens make in the management of their health and care that will ultimately determine adherence to treatment. A lack of adherence is an established public health concern, with significant effects on the individual patient, as well as healthcare systems as a whole.
A multitude of health-related information resources are now available to patients, tapping into demands for greater engagement with personal healthcare. This digital era, however, is compromised by two major concerns. Firstly, the sheer volume of information available has become disorientating to users, many of whom have poor health literacy to start with, and do not know which source to trust for up-to-date guidance. Distribution of this information across different source locations only compounds the issue. Secondly, existing health-related resources are generally not personalised to their specific needs or health literacy level, and therefore large amounts of the information available are irrelevant to the patient. Indeed, product information is a prime example of this phenomenon, with little direct evidence to suggest that patients are actively reading, understanding and adhering to details in the patient leaflet (PL). Bearing in mind that the product information is considered for most products to be the primary risk minimisation measure, this paradigm clearly needs to change.
There is therefore the need to lay the foundations for the application of digital technologies to health information in order to transform citizens’ understanding of their health and care, thereby promoting adherence to prescribed treatments, and ultimately contributing to better outcomes. The topic is consistent with the EU Digital Single Market Strategy which highlights the need and opportunity to introduce a digital transformation of health and care, and is aligned with the IMI Strategic Research Agenda under Axis 4 ‘Patient Tailored Adherence Programmes’. The topic is also consistent with the key benefits noted in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Action Plan on e-Product Information (ePI) and subsequently in the draft key principles for electronic product information published by EMA following an EMA/HMA/EC stakeholder workshop. During the workshop, this topic was presented alongside other initiatives in the context of a future vision for electronic product information in the broader digital health landscape, and the EMA also shared details of their mapping of ongoing ePI initiatives, illustrating the very considerable degree of interest and activity in this area at the present time.
Scope:
The principle objective of this topic is to demonstrate how the use of an integrated, digital, user-centric health information solution could enable a tangible improvement in the ability of citizens to access and understand reliable, relevant health information from different sources.
Access to and understanding of health information are key components determining health literacy, and the health literacy level of a citizen underlies their decision-making in regarding to management of their health and care, including adherence to treatment. Accordingly, a secondary objective will be to measure how improved access to and understanding of health information translates into higher levels of treatment adherence, safer use of medicines and consequently better health outcomes, with new insights into how health information can be optimised to act as an effective risk minimisation measure.
The topic objectives will be achieved by a phased approach, in which later stages build on the outputs of the earlier research activities in an agile manner:
1. Establishing stakeholder needs and development of appropriate KPIs
Research will be conducted to establish an in-depth understanding of citizens’ expectations and aspirations for the provision of healthcare information in a digital setting to form the basis for future project activities and design-planning for technology development. Specific contexts/patient journeys will be mapped at this stage either on specific therapy areas or other product-type scenarios, such as non-prescription medicines or vaccines. The needs of different patient populations, including vulnerable patients, will also be considered. KPIs will be developed in relation to the two key objectives outlined above to enable the measurement of the success of the proposed integrated digital health information approach versus the current paradigm (which typically relies on paper-based product information for the patient and/or fragmented digital sources).
2. Technology platform and digital solution
Development of an underlying open source technology platform, and a digital solution to enable testing and measurement of the effectiveness of a digital approach to meet defined user needs.
The initial focus will be on product information, electronic health records (EHRs) and a two-way communication channel with the patient. Appropriate, trusted data sources will be linked to the platform taking into account applicable data security and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) considerations. A digital solution with tailored information in line with patient needs will be developed for the proof of concept testing of understanding and acceptability. Alignment with the key principles on the common standard for ePI coming from the EMA Action Plan will also be taken into account.
Depending on technical progress with product information and EHRs, the latter stages of the project may include a wider range of trusted health educational materials (HEMs) within the platform, with the aim of further enhancing patient understanding.
3. Evaluation of the ability of digital solutions to enhance risk minimisation approaches through the generation of real-world evidence
Feedback gathered via the digital tool can be used to assess understandability and options can be evaluated for how to further assess the effectiveness of the platform as a risk minimisation tool.
Ongoing: Development and execution of a sustainability plan
A sustainability plan will be developed over the life of the project which details recommendations for how successful concepts/technology approaches will be carried forward and implemented into the digital healthcare ecosystem at the national/regional level in a sustainable and practical manner. The draft plan will be developed early in the life of the project and adapted in an agile manner based on the project outcomes.
Any form of promotional materials will not be in scope for this project.
Expected Impact:
Applicants should describe how the outputs of the proposed project will contribute to the following impacts and include baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact.
Allow individual patients to easily access trusted health information, tailored to be relevant to their specific needs. Empower these patients and better prepare them for informed interaction with national healthcare systems.
Further build patients’ (digital) health literacy, so allowing for better decision-making concerning their health care, disease prevention and health promotion, to maintain or improve quality of life throughout the course of life.
Positively impact healthcare at a societal level through enhanced adherence, better use of resources, and improved overall patient outcomes; the approach may offer particular benefits in complex scenarios, for example where patients are managing multiple morbidities.
Improve the effectiveness of ePIs as a primary risk minimisation measure by surfacing greater insights on access, understanding and the usability of the information provided to them.
The technology platform/tools developed for the purposes of the project will be made available open-source, and will be accessible to other companies/developers to use this as a basis for further market-specific applications which can accommodate the specifics of local digital ecosystems, allowing flexibility to best support longer-term implementation of the integrated digital healthcare approach.
The implementation will enable relevant and approved updated trusted health information to be pushed in a timely manner to ensure adherence with changes in safety or usage information to continue to enhance patient adherence and safety after and with patient permission to receive alerts pertinent to them;
The digital approach and technology developed under the project has the potential to transform the patient experience as they engage with and manage their health and care throughout their healthcare journey. The figure below illustrates how such a journey may be envisaged in the future, in an environment in which digital information sources are integrated effectively and tailored to the needs of the individual.
Applicants should indicate how their proposal will impact the competitiveness and industrial leadership of Europe by, for example, engaging suitable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."

","19 November 2020","Specific Challenge:
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic immune-mediated disease involving axial and peripheral joints, nails, skin and enthesis. Cutaneous manifestations often precede articular symptoms and it has been estimated that about 20-30 % of psoriatic patients develop arthritis or enthesitis over time. In fact, the precedence of cutaneous symptoms may give as much as about 7 years to predict, detect and potentially treat PsA.
Currently, it is felt that the earlier PsA can be diagnosed, the better the chances that treatment could influence the disease
There are still a large number of patients suffering from PsA that are diagnosed after several years of signs and symptoms (late diagnosis) and fail to respond to current standard of care treatments, or quickly relapse on, or following treatment.
The Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) identified the following major unmet medical needs:
Early diagnosis of PsA either in psoriasis (PsO) patients or in patients without initial psoriasis skin manifestations. Significant delay in diagnosis contributes to poor clinical and radiographic outcome.
Early identification of patients at risk of progression to PsA. Defining the predictors of progression to PsA in patients with skin PsO will enable earlier intervention and possibly even prevent development of PsA.
Definition of the clinical, genetic, immune factors or protein biomarkers that predict disease progression in PsA patients at time of diagnosis.
Better prediction, at diagnosis, for prognosis and stratification by therapeutic needs.
Scope:
The aim of this topic is to characterise the natural history of PsA from psoriasis to “early” PsA to “full-fledged” PsA, as diagnosed by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR). This characterisation will be based on discovering new biomarkers and endotypes, constructed on genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and/or clinical markers. To identify those endotypes, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) processes will be needed.
In particular, the topic aims to achieve the following specific objectives:
to enable rheumatologists, dermatologists and general practitioners to make an early diagnosis of PsA in patients with PsO and other rheumatic disorders;
to identify early patients at risk of progression to PsA in order to enable earlier interventions and possibly prevent PsA development;
to define the factors that predict disease progression in PsA patients, including early prediction of bone/joint damages, leading to the development of more adapted treatment strategies;
to develop rational and personalised treatment strategies (e.g. select the optimal first line or second line treatment based on patient characteristics) with optimised outcomes in PsA patients and reduce the disease burden.
Expected Impact:
In their proposals, applicants should describe how the outputs of the project will contribute to the following impacts and include wherever possible baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact:
“Early PsA” diagnosis and earlier personalised treatments for patients would impact the disease progression and ultimately prevent PsA development. AI would help identifying endotypes which could take into account the clinical and biological heterogeneities of PsA.
Development of objective and sensitive functional measures would enable the early diagnosis of PsA in PsO patients and the early prediction of bone/joint damages in PsA patients, yielding long-lived reduction in disease and improvement of patients’ quality of life.
Improved rates of treatment successes through better understanding of the relation between molecular characteristics of PsA and treatment responses would reduce costs to patients (side effects) and society (economics).
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project plans to leverage the public-private partnership model to maximise impacts on innovation, research & development; regulatory, clinical and healthcare practices, as relevant. This could include a strategy for the engagement with patients, healthcare professional associations, healthcare providers, regulators, HTA (health technology assessment) agencies, payers, etc., where relevant.
In addition, applicants should describe how the project will impact on the competitiveness and growth of companies including SMEs.
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project will:
Manage research data including use of data standards1.
Disseminate, exploit, and sustain the project results. This may involve engaging with suitable biological and medical sciences research infrastructures2.
Communicate the project’s activities to relevant target audiences.

","19 November 2020","Specific Challenge:
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide.1 To achieve the target of TB elimination by 2035, the WHO estimates that there is a funding shortfall of over USD1 billion per year in TB research. The treatment of drug-sensitive TB is an onerous regimen of four drugs for two months followed by two drugs for four months (six-months total), and multidrug-resistant TB may require treatment for up to two years. Many patients find adherence difficult, and the current drugs are associated with significant tolerability issues. Shorter and safer treatment regimens are urgently needed. Tuberculosis has a low or negative expected return on investment and therefore fails to attract funding: this call addresses this high unmet medical and public health need.
Currently, TB drug development involves 14-day monotherapy trials for early bactericidal activity (EBA) to identify the maximally efficacious dose for a new chemical entity (NCE). The standard trial design contains no option to change doses or de-escalate in-stream in response to emerging Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) or safety data, resulting in a flat dose-respose.2 In Phase 2B, the efficacy of treatment combinations is then studied in eight weeks of dosing, with time-to-sputum-culture-conversion as the primary endpoint. This paradigm has multiple weaknesses: inadequate exploration of dose response; lack of innovative study designs to empirically determine optimal duration of therapy as well as inability to study multiple regimens in parallel. Moreover, there is a lack of Phase 2 biomarkers that adequately predict phase 3 outcome (relapse-free cure).3,4,5
Therefore, there is a critical need for innovative trial designs in TB. Efficient adaptive trial designs would accelerate clinical development in Phase 2, but cannot be implemented currently due to the lack of in-stream biomarkers for sterilising cure/relapse. Several RNA expression, cytokine, bacterial and radiological biomarkers have been proposed in the literature, but to date there has been neither comparison nor prospective validation of these biomarkers. A biomarker that predicts relapse at an individual level may further create opportunities for individualised medicine, or even permit creation/validation of trial simulations. These trial simulations could help optimise trial design, and facilitate in-stream decision-making in adaptive trials.
Scope:
The objectives of this Call Topic are to develop and implement innovative, state of the art adaptive clinical trial designs for the field of TB regimen development able to define the therapeutic dose for existing experimental New Chemical Entities (NCE’s) within treatment combinations. The funded action will define the duration and composition of novel treatment combinations that will shorten or simplify the standard of care, as well as prospectively validating biomarkers against the relapse endpoint. In addition, the funded action is expected to develop clinical trial simulations, evaluate new technologies to monitor and enhance treatment adherence, and develop an understanding of population pharmacogenomics.
The funded action will develop innovative trial designs able to define optimal treatment duration against endpoints that better predict the current Phase 3 endpoint of relapse and will improve efficiency by comparing multiple regimens in parallel within the same study. Early interims will stop failing/futile arms, resulting in even greater efficiencies.
The funded action should also prospectively validate biomarkers against a relapse endpoint. The primary objectives of the biomarker work is to validate i) biomarkers able to accurately prioritise regimens for evaluation in phase 3, ii) biomarkers that are able to predict sterilizing cure/relapse at the individual patient level, and iii); a third, more ambitious objective, is to identify biomarkers that permit the building of a clinical trial simulation platform.
Expected Impact:
The objectives, deliverables and impact of the resulting action are well aligned with the mission and goals of IMI2 JU to deliver increased success rate of biomarkers and priority medicines in innovative clinical trials. The expected impact of the funded action will also help attain 2030 UN Strategic Development Goals and 2035 End TB Targets by:
Providing new tools and understanding on how to progress TB science for the discovery and development of new clinical candidates and combinations thereof across the TB R&D landscape with special emphasis on innovative clinical trial design and development of novel biomarkers

","19 November 2020","Specific Challenge:
The last decade has seen tremendous advances in the development of effective targeted therapies as well as in immuno-oncology to more effectively treat cancer. Despite this, cures are still rare in the metastatic setting. In most cases, an initial response to treatment is followed by the eventual emergence of drug resistance . Drug resistance in cancer is one of the greatest causes of mortality and despite increasing success with targeted therapies in the clinic (including immunotherapy), the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade cell death are still not well understood. Drug combinations are likely to be critical to overcoming drug resistance but are dependent on identifying the cellular programmes that cancer cells use to resist therapeutic agents.
In tumours that initially respond to treatment, rare cancer cells can survive and withstand therapy (‘Drug Tolerant Persister’ cells, DTPs) and can act as a reservoir for the eventual emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, these studies have shown that these cells are able to survive drug treatment by altering the transcriptional state of specific signalling pathways, and that in the early stages such changes are plastic and reversible but that over time these changes become stable and fixed.
Recent technological advances in single-cell sequencing have revolutionised the study of individual cells within cancer populations and, importantly, would allow the characterisation of DTPs, something previously impossible with bulk sequencing technologies . Single-cell sequencing provides information that is not confounded by genotypic or phenotypic heterogeneity of bulk samples. Importantly, it has confirmed the existence of DTPs in patients following treatment response and, more importantly, the characterisation of the transcriptionally altered pathways in DTPs. Characterising the transcriptionally altered pathways in persister cells, the biological processes they regulate and their druggability will be critical to future drug combination strategies, with the goal of preventing or significantly delaying the development of drug resistance.
There are numerous challenges in applying single cell sequencing to arguably one of the most important barriers to curing in cancer today – drug resistance, and specifically:
Defining best sequencing protocols – single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a fast-moving field with a recent benchmarking paper comparing 13 different methods.
Computational approaches to big data – as with sequencing methods, the analysis framework is constantly evolving and there are challenges in integrating data across studies and platforms
Standardisation of data formats
Best practice single cell collection from in vitro and in vivo model systems
Application of single-cell sequencing to clinical samples
Spatial imaging technologies
Biological interpretation of data, including novel target identification
This topic proposes to apply state-of-the-art single-cell sequencing technologies to characterise cancer cell populations pre-treatment, at minimal residual disease (for DTPs) and upon the acquisition of drug resistance and from a variety of pre-clinical human and mouse models as well as clinical samples.
Scope:
The overall objective of the call topic is to use state-of-the-art single-cell sequencing to understand and overcome drug resistance in cancer by characterising the biology of drug tolerant persister cells, building the capability for such studies across Europe.
The call topic will address primarily adult tumours, with the provision to include childhood tumours where appropriate models are available at a later stage of the program. To optimise our ability to determine the role of tissue lineage on the biological processes observed in single-cells, we propose that the majority (>80%) of the single-cells should be provided from drug treatments in 3 adult cancers:
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
breast cancer
colorectal cancer
The goals of the call topic are:
To characterise the biology of drug tolerant persister cells - defining the signalling pathways and cellular processes that enable DTPs to survive drug treatment and thereby identify novel drug targets to overcome this – using state-of-the-art single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics in a range of cancer models.
To better understand the tumour microenvironment – to avoid solely focusing on cell intrinsic drug resistance programmes, a key element of the work packages should be to use spatial imaging techniques to explore the interaction between cancer cells and the microenvironment.
Generation of single cell RNAseq data from adult and childhood cancers – although the pre-clinical models used to explore the biology of drug treatment in cancer are predominantly based on adult cancers, drug resistance is equally a major problem in childhood tumours. The applicants should anticipate that from year 3 of the funded project, specific childhood cancers could be considered for inclusion where the appropriate models are accessible and where there is a hypothesis relationship with drugs or tumours being investigated by the consortium.
To develop best practice in clinical validation and single-cell sequencing – clinical validation will be key to translation of any findings and a change in clinical practice. To include informed patient consent forms that cover all intended uses, including clinical outcome data and sharing of data inside the consortium and with 3rd parties. GDPR-compliant tracking of patient data, samples and PDXs.
To create gold standard protocols for single cell collection – across a range of models and to include differing methods for isolating single cells from human (organoids, clinical biopsies) and mouse (PDX, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and syngeneic mice) model systems.
To develop core analytical methods – use pre-treatment, on-treatment and post-treatment single-cell sequencing data to develop novel computational approaches to identify the different subtypes of cancer cells present and the biological processes that are complicit in maintaining their survival following drug treatment.
To build EU capability in single-cell sequencing – in the process of developing the protocols for single cell collection, sequencing and analysis, the funded project will put in place infrastructure to enable other groups in the EU to carry out similar single-cell sequencing studies in both cancer and non-cancer models.
Expected Impact:
A comprehensive database, profiling DTPs across a range of cancers and therapies would enable a deeper understanding of the biology of DTPs and allow cross-tumour studies.
Impact for Patients
Identification of novel drug targets in DTPs and resulting drug combinations that delay or prevent the emergence of drug resistance in cancer
Better understanding of the contribution of tumour heterogeneity and plasticity to disease outcome, progression and relapse
Impact for Academia and SMEs
Harmonisation of protocols for single cell experiments
Enhanced infrastructure in the EU for single cell sequencing
Development of gold standards for the analysis of single-cell sequencing data
Access to comparative data on different pre-clinical and clinical models and better understanding of the biology of DTPs in cancer with a high likelihood of spin-off projects
Improvements in single cell sequencing and spatial imaging with potential for commercial development
Better understanding of drug development post-novel target identification
Impact for Industry
Access to a data source for further functional studies (e.g. KO, knock-out, knock-in, target perturbation) that will lead to opportunities for identification of novel targets in DTP space - pointing to new targets or rational drug combinations that alter the drug resistance paradigm
Access to single cell measurement data combined with outcome data (models) and clinical outcome data
Development of expertise in the analysis of single-cell sequencing data
Gold standard methods for the delivery of single cell projects"

Alongside chemotherapy and surgery, radiotherapy (RT) has evolved to become one of the essential therapies for the treatment of cancer. However, radiotherapy is not suitable for all cancer types, and when used, the potential for negative side effects to surrounding organs can limit the dose administered leading to longer treatment times and reduced effectiveness. By delivering a high radiation dose, more precisely focused on the tumour site, proton therapy (PT) has the potential to reduce these adverse events and provide better outcomes for cancer patients.
Although the number of patients treated annually with PT is increasing, the clinical evidence supporting its effectiveness remains limited due to the lack of large multi-centre studies. There is a critical need for high quality evidence from multi-centre trials to determine the potential role of PT for various cancer indications and to allow a consensus to be reached across Europe on the most suitable indications.
A robust evidence base on the effectiveness of PT has the potential to open a new treatment modality for cancers with currently very low survival rates, for example oesophageal cancer. Oesophageal cancer is the seventh most common cancer worldwide, with more than 570 000 new cases per year leading to more than 500 000 cancer deaths annually. Until recently, surgery was the main treatment for patients with localised disease. In 2012, the results of the Chemoradiotherapy for Oesophageal Cancer Followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) randomised trial demonstrated that adding neoadjuvant chemo-radiation to surgery results in a beneficial effect on pathological complete response (pCR) and survival compared to surgery alone. However, with a pCR of 30 % and a five-year overall survival rate of 45-50 %, there is still a large unmet need.
The unique properties of PT allow oesophageal cancer patients the opportunity to receive more conformal radiotherapy with the possibility of reducing the dose to the surrounding normal organs including the lungs, heart and liver. Treatment of oesophageal cancer patients with PT is under evaluation by several institutions. Recent publications present the role and the potential benefits PT offers to those patients and could lead to better patient outcomes. Nevertheless, none of those publications provide level 1 evidence.
To build a robust evidence base to assess the potential of PT in oesophageal and other cancers, multi-centre international trials have to take place. The current diversity of reimbursement and coverage policies across the EU makes these trials difficult. A public-private collaboration of proton therapy oncologists, treatment centres, software developers and equipment manufacturers is needed to define a methodology to conduct clinical trials in PT at a European scale. In addition, a key factor is the generation of robust clinical evidence which is neutral and unbiased. A clinical trial conducted in a European framework, in a collaboration between industry and public partners, has an inherent degree of independence and neutrality required by the highest standards of clinical research.
Scope:
For full details of this topic, please see the topic text and webinars on the IMI website.
The main objective of this topic is to examine the value of proton therapy as a treatment modality through a clinical study in oesophageal cancer. The study will compare outcomes between pencil-beam scanning proton therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The study will determine if proton therapy in a trimodality (radiotherapy-chemotherapy-surgery) treatment;
(i) reduces treatment-related cardio-pulmonary toxicity;
(ii) increases loco-regional tumour control and pathological complete response and the influence of dose escalation;
(iii) improves disease-free and overall survival.
Oesophageal cancer is chosen due to its relatively high occurrence in the population and the possibility to extend findings to other cancer types.
A second objective is to use the evidence generated during the oesophageal cancer study to reach a consensus on which methodology is most suitable to evaluate PT treatment for other indications. To facilitate this objective, cost-effectiveness data should be collected during the duration of the action. This objective should be supported by engaging with selected stakeholders as advisors such as the broader oncology community including oncologists (e.g. through relevant European networks), healthcare providers, health technology assessment (HTA) agencies, payers, and patient associations. In addition, the findings of the proposed project should be disseminated via publications, presentations at relevant conferences, and other suitable dissemination methods.
Expected Impact:
For full details of this topic, please see the topic text and webinars on the IMI website.
In their proposals, applicants should describe how the outputs of the project will contribute to the following impacts and include wherever possible baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact:
The outcome of this research is potentially practice-changing as it may define a new and improved standard for the treatment of oesophageal cancer patients and potentially patients with other cancer indications.
The morbidity data from the study will allow better understanding of the dose-volume relationships for normal tissue complications, enabling refined selection of patients for proton therapy in the future.
The results should allow health authorities and healthcare providers to improve the quality of care through better evidence of benefits and patient outcomes and support reimbursement decisions.
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project plans to leverage the public-private partnership model to maximise impacts on innovation, research & development; regulatory, clinical and healthcare practices, as relevant. This could include a strategy for the engagement with patients, healthcare professional associations, healthcare providers, regulators, HTA agencies, payers, etc., where relevant. An advisory group including these stakeholders should be set up.
In their proposals, applicants should outline how the project will:
Manage research data including use of data standards.
Disseminate, exploit, and sustain the project results. This may involve engaging with suitable biological and medical sciences research infrastructures.
Communicate the project activities to relevant target audiences."

","21 January 2020
","19 November 2020","Specific Challenge:
In the past two decades, protein pharmaceuticals have become the fastest growing class of therapeutics owing to their beneficial impacts on the treatment of severe and life-threatening conditions and diseases. Development and manufacturing of protein pharmaceuticals is, however, challenging and requires overcoming various manufacturing hurdles such as issues with the purity of the protein product. The safety and efficacy of protein pharmaceuticals depend on their purity. Impurities in marketed protein pharmaceuticals may be present due to limitations in manufacturing processes or may also be a result of degradation processes occurring not only during manufacturing, but also during long-term storage of the bulk drug substance and/or final drug product (DP). Impurities within therapeutic protein products can cause severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients, that may be acute, as is the case for infusion-induced anaphylaxis and pseudo-allergy responses, which may even result in patient death, or long-term like unwanted immunogenicity.
Physical aggregation and chemical degradation can occur throughout a protein product’s life history, and even modest environmental stresses can cause extensive damage. Development of effective upstream and downstream processes as well as robust formulations and filling processes are crucial for maintaining product quality, and hence, for the safety and efficacy of protein pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceutical industry has made great progress in improving bulk and DP manufacturing as well as storage and transportation conditions to minimise the level of degradation. However, there exists only low control over the many factors that may affect product quality after the protein pharmaceuticals are released and shipped. Routine handling or unintentional mishandling of therapeutic protein products may cause protein degradation that remains unnoticed but can potentially compromise the clinical safety and efficacy of the product. Storage of the DP outside the recommended condition ranges, use of incompatible supply and/or technology, careless handling of drug during preparation for administration and during delivery to patient are just a few examples of such (mis)handling. When it comes to handling of DP by patients, the social, cultural, logistical and environmental differences between different geographies and cultures can also impact the handling conditions.
There has been increasing expression of concern in the past decade regarding the significance of the post-production handling of protein pharmaceuticals. At the same time, studies revealed that the consequences of presence of impurities in DP can be severe. Potentially high likelihood and/or severity in consequences in combination with the low level of control over the processes by the industry make these concerns a significant risk that needs to be addressed in a public-private partnership that includes all relevant stakeholders.
Scope:
The first objective of this topic is to improve the understanding of real-world stressful drug product handling steps and their effects on protein product quality.
All protein DPs are considered to be within the scope of the topic.
All handling steps for preparation, transport and administration should be addressed:
Studying the effects of the handling steps on drug product quality is in the scope of the project
Supplies that are used for handling of the protein pharmaceuticals are also to be investigated and evaluated. Evaluation of new technologies that are used to handle protein pharmaceuticals such as closed-system transfer devices are of interest;
Handling practices include the ones that are performed by healthcare professionals in hospital and compounding pharmacies and the ones in hands of patients. The understanding should be as thorough as possible and may be , obtained by the use of new technologies and digital tools that record details visually or by sensors of conditioning parameters during storage and administration processes, among other methods;
Routine handling procedures, i.e. the ones that are currently used as standard procedures for protein drug products in pharmacies and by patients should be addressed.
These risks associated with the handling of protein DPs should be assessed and potential solutions developed;
Mishandling cases with high level of likelihood or severe impacts should also be examined.
The second objective of this topic is to use this understanding for development of guidelines and operating processes to improve the DP robustness and pharma processes, and to develop more efficient training.
Improving the in-use studies and other processes in development of protein pharmaceuticals is in the scope of the topic.
Innovative solutions that help ensuring the stability of DP during handling are welcome.
Improving the training materials and improving the handling culture are in the scope of the topic. Training aspects should cover training for professionals and patients.
Utilisation of technologic tools (video, webinar, online media and creative manuals) for development of novel training methods and materials is within the scope of the topic.
Expected Impact:
Through this project, a better understanding of the handling procedures of protein DPs and associated stresses in hospitals and in the hands of patients will be obtained. The project will assess the risks associated with these handling steps and provide solutions to ensure high-quality delivery and administration of protein DP;
The project will help participating pharmaceutical companies to improve their processes with regards to the development of more robust DPs that can withstand handling stresses;
At the same time, access to the resulting improved methods to influence the handling culture can be used by both the private and public sectors in the interest of patients. Foremost amongst the expected impacts is the improved training for professionals and patient/caregivers to ensure the stability of protein DP. This will have global effects on the manufacturing side as well as the user side at pharmacies, hospitals and with patients, thus providing benefits to all healthcare stakeholders;
Generation of knowledge in the area of stress-stability will help all the stakeholders involved and can be directly applied to the design of the processes and addressing important but challenging issues around the development of therapeutics and delivery to patients;
Overall, the project is expected to lead to improvements in the safety and efficacy of protein drug therapies."

Vaccination is one of the greatest achievements in healthcare. However, developing a vaccine remains costly, time consuming, and risky. Advances in immunology, disease modelling, in silico modelling, including the analysis of big data and the application of machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence (AI), provide opportunities to innovate, de-risk and accelerate the vaccine-development process. Many of these advances have occurred in the academic sector.
These advances can be harnessed to tackle scientific bottlenecks in vaccine development and to nurture and expand a vaccines innovation ecosystem by bringing together academics, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and industry to collaborate in four areas:
(i) in silico platform for knowledge management and mathematical modelling of the immune system;
(ii) novel controlled human infection models (CHIMs);
(iii) next-generation human in vitro systems and assays; and
(iv) mathematical modelling platforms for vaccine substance and product attributes in biomanufacturing.
A consortium of academics, SMEs and industry will provide the opportunity to gather the best experts to address these challenges. Academia is at the forefront of scientific and technological advances; SMEs are adept at providing services and innovating those services; and industry has broad overlapping expertise in vaccine development and manufacture. Although the topic covers distinct scientific domains, there are numerous synergies among them. Hence, to address the challenges and to maximise these synergies, collaborations within-sector and cross-sector are needed, and therefore investment in a public-private partnership can provide the impetus to bring academics and SMEs into an alliance with industry partners.
Scope:
The overall objective is to accelerate and de-risk the development of new vaccines by incorporating scientific and technological advances from the academic and biotech sectors into industry, and to develop more predictive biological and mathematical models of vaccine performance. The topic is composed of four subtopics with the following specific objectives:
Subtopic 1: to develop an open-data/open-source in silico platform focussed on immunobiological processes, and not on a given disease or vaccine indication.
Subtopic 2: to develop improved or novel CHIMs for influenza, RSV and C. difficile, to facilitate the generation of early efficacy data for vaccine candidates.
Subtopic 3: to develop (i) prototype next-generation in vitro systems for antigen identification/validation and drug substance and drug product characterisation/validation; and (ii) associated functional immune assays for clinically-relevant (surrogate) endpoints.
Subtopic 4: To develop an open data/open source in silico biomanufacturing platform incorporating models for (i) predicting vaccine-product stability; and (ii) the parameters to maintain process robustness for unit-operation scale up or scale down, and for process transfer.The overall objective is to accelerate and de-risk the development of new vaccines by incorporating scientific and technological advances from the academic and biotech sectors into industry, and to develop more predictive biological and mathematical models of vaccine performance.

European researchers need effective and convenient access to the best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the advancement of knowledge and technology. The aim of this action is to facilitate access to the best research infrastructures of different but close communities gathered in larger domains, ensuring their optimal use and the common improvement of their services.
Scope:
The main objective of this topic is the provision of access to research infrastructures and the harmonisation of national and European procedures for providing access. Proposals will mobilise a comprehensive group of several key research infrastructures in a given large domain as well as other stakeholders (e.g. public authorities, funding agencies, technological partners, research institutions) from different Member States, Associated Countries and other third countries[1] when appropriate, in particular when they offer complementary or more advanced services than those available in Europe.
Proposals should include a plan and effective commitment towards the optimum integration of the research infrastructure services of the different but close communities under the Pilot scheme, as well as activities to monitor the related progress. This integration will be an element of the evaluation of the Pilot scheme and will help developing this scheme in Horizon Europe.

They should define a data management plan, even when they opt out of the extended Pilot on Open Research Data. When they address the curation, preservation and provision of access to the data collected or produced under the project, proposals should build upon the state of the art in ICT and e-infrastructures for data, computing and networking, and ensure connection to the European Open Science Cloud.
Access should be provided only to research infrastructures of European interest, i.e., those infrastructures able to attract users from countries other than the country where they are located (or group of countries in case of distributed infrastructures). Research infrastructures can be involved as beneficiaries or as third parties, the latter usually structured under a national access provision coordinator or a pan-European research infrastructure. The services they open for trans-national and virtual access under the project and, when relevant, the amount of units of access they make available, must be included in the catalogue of services to which the project will offer access. Projects are encouraged to extend their catalogues under their lifetime, selecting, on the basis of the excellence of their offer of access provision, new research infrastructures of European interest to be involved in the grant. The new research infrastructures should specify, for each of their installations, the services offered and their quality level. In addition for trans-national access, they should also indicate the unit of access, the number of users to be served and the amount of units to be provided to them as well as the related access costs and users' travel and subsistence costs for visiting the infrastructure. The selected research infrastructures can be included in the grants through amendments. To this extent proposals should describe the procedure to select the new infrastructures and earmark appropriate resources.
Proposals should also map and analyse the access modalities adopted by different infrastructures and different countries, and develop and trial models, mechanisms and practices to establish the optimal conditions for the long-term engagement of funders in making trans-national access sustainable beyond the EU funding.
In particular, in line with the excellence-driven access defined in the European Charter for Access to Research Infrastructures, the research infrastructures offering access under the proposals and/or their funding agencies, should aim at adapting their national calls for access (if they launch such calls) to the same excellence based selection procedure used, at European level, in the project.
As the main objective of this topic is the provision of access, at least 60% of the contribution from the EU should be used to cover the related costs (access costs and travel and subsistence of selected users).
Projects shall publicise widely the access offered under the grant to ensure that researchers who might wish to have access to these infrastructures are made aware of the possibilities open to them and, for trans-national access, open specific calls to invite applications for access to all the installations listed in the catalogue. Trans-national and virtual access provision shall follow the rules specified for integrating activities under point (ii) “Trans-national and/or virtual access activities” in part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures”. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.
In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), proposals should, whenever appropriate, pay due attention to any related international initiative (i.e. outside the EU) and foster the use and deployment of global standards.
Proposals are expected to duly take into account all relevant ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures as well as relevant major European initiatives, to exploit synergies, to reflect on sustainability and to ensure complementarity and coherence with the existing European Infrastructures landscape.
Proposals should include clear indicators allowing the assessment of the progress towards the general and specific objectives, other than the access provision.
As the scope of this topic is to ensure integration and access to key European infrastructures in a given domain and to avoid duplication of effort, at most one proposal per domain is expected to be submitted.
On the basis of a multiannual plan drafted taking also into account the assessment and the timing of previous grants, this work programme invites proposals addressing the following three domains.
Facilities for research on Atmosphere This activity aims to provide integrated access to and improve the services, included on-line services, of state-of-the-art European ground-based stations for long term observations of aerosols, clouds and short lived gases, key observation and monitoring infrastructures for non-CO2 gas, and instrumented environmental chambers for atmospheric simulation.
Research infrastructures for research in micro-nano technologies for materials. This activity aims to provide integrated access to and improve the services, included on-line services, of key infrastructures (e.g. experimental installations for micro- and nanofabrication, analytical and modelling/simulation facilities) for research in material nanoscience and nanotechnology, ranging from synthesis and nanolithography to advanced characterization and theoretical modelling/numerical simulation. Safety issues of nanoparticles should be taken into account.
Research Infrastructures for advanced optical/IR and radio astronomy. This activity aims to provide integrated access to and improve the services, included on-line services, of the key research infrastructures in Europe for optical/infrared astronomy and advanced radio astronomy, including Very Long Baseline Interferometry.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 15 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Harmonisation of national and European procedures for providing access and coordination of national and European funders for the provision oftrans-national access to research infrastructures is fostered.
Models, mechanisms and practices to establish the optimal conditions for the long-term engagement of funders in making trans-national access sustainable beyond the EU funding are assessed, tested and/or developed
Researchers will have simplified and more efficient trans-national access to a wider and integrated set of advanced research infrastructure services, from different but close communities, to conduct leading-edge, multidisciplinary research. They benefit from an increased focus on user needs.
Operators of related infrastructures develop synergies and complementary capabilities, leading to improved and harmonised services. Economies of scale and improved use of resources across Europe are also realised due to less duplication of services, common development and the optimisation of operations.
A new generation of researchers is educated that is ready to optimally exploit all the essential tools for their research.
Closer interactions between larger number of researchers active in and around a number of research infrastructures, in different but close fields, facilitate cross-disciplinary fertilisations and a wider sharing of information, knowledge and technologies across fields and between academia and industry.
The integration of major scientific equipment or sets of instruments and of knowledge-based resources (collections, archives, structured scientific information, data infrastructures, etc.) leads to a better management of the continuous flow of data collected or produced by these facilities and resources.
When applicable, the integrated and harmonised access to resources at European level can facilitate the use beyond research and contribute to evidence-based policy making.
When applicable, the socio-economic impact of past investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Research infrastructures, as providers of advanced services and as procurers of leading-edge technologies, have an innovation potential that has not always been sufficiently exploited. Opportunities provided by the development of components, instruments, services and knowledge for the implementation and upgrade of research infrastructures, could be better exploited to push the limits of existing technologies. There is a clear innovation potential associated with procurement from industry during the construction and upgrade of research infrastructures.
A co-innovation approach to continuously generate, scale and deploy breakthrough technologies with market and social value needs to be adopted by research infrastructures.
Scope:
The aim is the establishment of an open initiative oriented towards a novel research and innovation collaborative framework engaging both the research communities in Europe using Research Infrastructures and the industry (including SMEs), for the mutual benefit of these stakeholders and the European society at large.
This initiative should address:
The identification of a wide spectrum of technology opportunities with breakthrough potential across Europe; the assessment of the feasibility and scalability of the identified opportunities; the selection and clustering of those opportunities with a clear potential for industrial implementation; and the support of those opportunities towards industrial applications having societal value;
The support of technology and innovation transfer and joint development measures of high-tech components;
The enabling of the best conditions for full exploitation by industrial partners of the innovation potential of Research Infrastructures (e.g. in the field of instrumentation and detectors);
As a pilot initiative, the proposals should mainly address the development of future detection and imaging technologies, which have applications in the fields of medicine, manufacturing industry, aerospace, ICT, engineering, environmental sciences and beyond, and should constitute a driver enabling the transfer of fundamental research towards industrial application.
This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The financial support to third parties is the primary aim of the action.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 20 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This activity will:
establish a co-innovation platform in the field of detection and imaging technologies
provide financial support and guidance towards industrial applicability to the identified co-innovation opportunities
increase the capacity to generate, absorb and use new technologies in Europe;
enhance the innovation capability of European Research Infrastructures;
increase the involvement of industry (including SMEs) in the development of research infrastructures, raising the technological level and competitiveness of European companies and generating market opportunities for them;
raise the awareness of industry (including SMEs) regarding opportunities offered by research infrastructure to improve their products, e.g. as experimental test facilities, innovation hubs, knowledge-based centres;
support the integration of research infrastructures into local, regional and global innovation systems;
when applicable, the socio-economic impact of past investments in research infrastructures from the European Structural and Investment Funds is enhanced."

","Coordination and support action
","08 December 2015
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Pan-European Research Infrastructures use more and more sophisticated technologies that can only be hosted in large-scale platforms combining R&D (Research and Development), integration and validation. These platforms can be viewed as Technological Infrastructures: they form a distributed network across Europe and provide Research Infrastructures with advanced key technologies and integration services. They also provide longer-term visibility and involvement of industry in scientific and technological advancements and therefore ensure greater socio-economic impact. The coordination of Technological Infrastructures working in a given technological domain and their networking will contribute to harmonise their operation conditions and increase their operation efficiency. This will permit the creation of a more efficient integrated ecosystem between academic laboratories, focussed on technological R&D needs of Research Infrastructures, large companies as well as SMEs, motivated by the innovative environment and the market opportunities created by the Research Infrastructure needs. Being focussed on innovation and on higher Technology Readiness Level (TRL) than usually targeted by Research Infrastructures, i.e. from TRL4 (technology validated in lab) to TRL6 (technology demonstrated in relevant environment), these networks of Technological Infrastructures should contribute to bridging the gap between the academic world and industry, and to the training of high-level engineers and technological scientists in Europe.
Scope:
Funding will be provided for the coordination and networking of Technological Infrastructures involving research infrastructures, industry and SMEs.
Proposals should address:
the definition of key techniques and trends which are crucial for the further development of Research Infrastructures, in close partnership with the industrial partners, especially with innovative SMEs;
the definition of roadmaps and/or strategic agendas together with industrial sector actors for key technologies for R&D and for the construction and upgrade of Research Infrastructures as well as for key technologies to be explored by industries;
the identification of the domains of societal applications and potential markets beyond Research Infrastructures;
the implementation of a strategy addressing the training of young engineers, technicians and scientists in an environment of strong industrial relevance and scientific excellence;
the exchange of good practices between user communities and managers of research infrastructures as regard benchmarking performance of technology platforms, harmonisation of tests, standards, reference materials, interoperability and data handling.
Proposals should cover a broad technological domain of interest for pan European Research Infrastructures such as but not restricted to components for accelerator based facilities, laser, high-field magnets, vacuum and cryogenic systems, or components for oceanic investigation.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The implementation of a coordinated ecosystem of Technological Infrastructures as key components of the European Research Infrastructure landscape, will help ensure both the scientific competitiveness of European Research Infrastructures in the long-term and the further development of innovative companies.
In particular this activity will:
Establish technology roadmaps and identify market opportunities shared between Research Infrastructures and Technology Infrastructures and socio-economic partners for a better positioning of Europe in the global Research Infrastructure sector;
Facilitate the creation of both large and viable markets and structuring industrial partners in a critical mass to enable European industry to respond to demands from international Research Infrastructures;
Established links between universities and industrial companies of such a technology cluster to ensure the dissemination of the acquired knowledge and the training of top-level engineers and technicians;
Support the integration of research infrastructures into local, regional and global innovation systems; the competitive nature of such a technology cluster-based approach will facilitate the development of synergies and complementarities across Europe and avoid duplication of work."

To develop new cross-sectoral industrial value chains across the EU, by building upon the innovation potential of SMEs. The EU needs to support the development of emerging industries, which will provide the growth and employment of the future. The reindustrialisation of the EU's industrial base has to focus on the development of long-term internationally competitive goods and services that require combining different competences and innovative solutions. The development of new industrial value chains calls for the collaboration and integration of different innovation actors, including large enterprises and especially SMEs, across different sectors towards the implementation of a joint vision.
SMEs need help to generate, take up and better capitalise on all forms of knowledge, creativity, craftsmanship and innovation – including for the application of existing cross-cutting or emerging technologies, advanced manufacturing, ICT, eco-innovative and resource-efficient solutions, new business models, service innovation and design. The potential of clusters – that represent favourable ecosystems for innovation and entrepreneurship – need to be better exploited in this respect.
Scope:
Cross-border and cross-sectoral collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship across different regions and value chains shall be promoted. The coordination and facilitation shall be led by cluster organisations and other intermediary organisations, by following a systemic approach that combines different resources, tools and instruments. Innovation actors, especially SMEs with mutually reinforcing competences, shall be supported in view of creating new industrial value chains that foster the development of emerging industries in Europe.
To this end, proposals shall outline a strategic vision for building new industrial value chains across the EU Member States and Associated Countries. They shall specifically focus on integrating and supporting groups of SMEs in collaboration with other innovation actors in addressing specific problems and challenges. Cluster organisations or other SME intermediaries shall be invited to set up collaboration and networking activities for SMEs and create a favourable ""open space"" for cross-sectoral fertilisation and value chain innovation to take place. Each proposal should demonstrate the capacity to:
1) validate ideas for structured innovation projects driven by SMEs from different sectors and countries in collaboration with other innovation actors and facilitate the coordination towards new industrial value chains through this collaboration space.
2) support innovation activities and/or channel a mix of different targeted entrepreneurial and innovation support measures (such as mentoring, coaching, innovation and technical assistance vouchers, etc.) directly to the innovation actors of the validated innovation projects to further support their development, integration and large-scale demonstration in a strategic manner. At least 75% of the total proposed budget shall be allocated to support innovation in SMEs directly, whereby the SMEs benefit by either participating in the consortium or by being supported as third party enterprises.
Background information on the systemic approach and strategic focus to be envisaged is provided to applicants.[1] Synergies with the European Structural and Investment Funds that may further support such large-scale demonstration projects will also be actively encouraged, notably through the engaged SME intermediaries. “Large-scale” does not necessarily refer to the amount of financial support provided for a particular project but to the extent of the roll-out of a staged process of experimentation and implementation with accompanying support that reaches out to groups of mutually reinforcing SMEs. This approach aims at “demonstrating at large scale” the potential impact of innovative solutions to specific challenges, rather than supporting isolated projects or SMEs.
For the first stage of the submission procedure, applicants should provide a concept note (of max. 10 pages), which should include a clear description of the ideas and objectives for an innovation action towards the development of new industrial value chains as well as an explanation of the main activities, implementation modalities (including for financial support to third parties, if applicable) and expected results foreseen. The concept note should further describe how the proposed systemic approach and strategic focus promises significant impact on economic growth and job; demonstrates a European dimension and added value; and has the potential to act as a catalyst by contributing to and/or leveraging other activities supported, for instance, under the European Structural and Investment Funds, e.g. in the context of smart specialisation strategies.
An estimate of the total costs of the proposed action and contribution to be requested from the Commission shall also be provided. Only proposals that pass the evaluation threshold for the first stage will be invited to a second stage of submission for a full proposal with a detailed description of the budget and activities planned to be undertaken.
The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.5 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This action allows for the provisions of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes.
Expected Impact:
Strengthen industrial leadership in the EU Member States and Associated Countries by reinforcing value chains that integrate innovative solutions in SMEs, along and across existing value chains.
Stimulate the creation of new globally competitive industrial value chains across the EU Member States and Associated Countries to accelerate the development of emerging industries, which will boost industrial competitiveness and underpin future economic growth, jobs, and progress towards a resource-efficient economy.
Further leverage and complement support for innovation in SMEs and other funding, which may be provided by national or regional authorities (including under the European Structural and Investment Funds) and/or by private investors (upfront or as follow-up investments), including in relation to the European Fund for Strategic Investments, Knowledge and Innovation Communities, European Technology Platforms, European Innovation Partnerships etc.
Contribute to regional smart specialisation strategies by capitalising upon concentrated and complementary competences for the development of new industrial value chains and emerging industries with a clear EU added-value.
Provide a clear and measurable contribution to the innovation performance of the supported SMEs in the short-term – as revealed by indicators such as numbers of new or significantly improved products (goods and/or services), processes, new marketing methods, or new organisational methods –, and to its impact on resource efficiency and/or turnover. A wider impact is also expected in the medium-term.
Improve the business environment of the supported SMEs by establishing open collaboration spaces that can involve innovation actors from different sectors and countries. This will lead to the creation of new ideas for innovation and new collaboration partnerships, which will be subject of further development and with the potential for further impact on business turnover.

At least 75% of the total proposed budget shall be allocated to support innovation in SMEs directly, whereby the SMEs benefit by either participating in the consortium or by receiving financial and/or other support as a third party (enterprise) in line with the conditions set out in General Annex K of the work programme.
Background information and guidance on the systemic approach and strategic focus to be envisaged is provided to applicants at the EU Cluster Portal[1] and in the background note[2] being part of this call. Synergies will be sought with other measures that are supporting such large-scale demonstration projects, in particular under the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) and COSME. This includes the thematic Smart Specialisation Platforms[3]- notably the one on Industrial Modernisation, European Strategic Cluster Partnerships[4], the European Cluster Collaboration Platform[5] and the European Observatory for Clusters and Industrial Change[6] as well as partnerships under the pilot action for interregional partnerships for innovative projects[7]. These synergies will be actively encouraged in the applicants' project partnership building and project implementation, notably through the engaged SME intermediaries. “Large-scale” does not necessarily refer to the amount of financial support provided for a particular project but to the extent of the roll-out of a staged process of experimentation and implementation with accompanying support that reaches out to groups of mutually reinforcing SMEs. This approach aims at “demonstrating at large scale” the potential impact of innovative solutions to specific challenges, rather than supporting isolated projects or SMEs.
For the first stage of the submission procedure, applicants should provide a concept note (of max. 10 pages), which should include a clear description of the ideas and objectives for an innovation action towards the development of new industrial value chains as well as an explanation of the main activities, implementation modalities (including for financial support to third parties, if applicable, and how to achieve the target of allocating at least 75% of the total proposed budget to support innovation in SMEs directly) and expected results foreseen (please refer to the grant conditions for this topic).
The concept note should further describe how the proposed systemic approach and strategic focus promises significant impact on economic growth and job; demonstrates a European dimension and added value; and has the potential to act as a catalyst by contributing to and/or leveraging other activities supported, for instance, under the European Structural and Investment Funds, e.g. in the context of smart specialisation strategies.
An estimate of the total costs of the proposed action and contribution to be requested from the Commission shall also be provided. Only proposals that pass the evaluation threshold for the first stage will be invited to a second stage of submission for a full proposal with a detailed description of the budget and activities planned to be undertaken.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.5 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Strengthen industrial leadership in the EU Member States and Associated Countries by reinforcing value chains that integrate innovative solutions in SMEs, along and across existing value chains.
Stimulate the creation of new globally competitive industrial value chains across the EU Member States and Associated Countries to accelerate the development of emerging industries, which will boost industrial competitiveness and underpin future economic growth, jobs, and progress towards a resource-efficient economy.
Further leverage and complement support for innovation in SMEs and other funding, which may be provided by national or regional authorities (including under the European Structural and Investment Funds) and/or by private investors (upfront or as follow-up investments), including in relation to the European Fund for Strategic Investments.
Contribute to the implementation of regional and national research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation strategies (RIS3), modern cluster policies as well as of strategic inter-regional collaboration under thematic Smart Specialisation Platforms and cluster partnerships supported by the European Cluster Collaboration Platform and the European Observatory for Clusters and Industrial Change by capitalising upon concentrated and complementary competences for the development of new industrial value chains and emerging industries with a clear EU added-value.
Provide a clear and measurable contribution to the innovation performance of the supported SMEs in the short-term - as revealed by indicators such as numbers of new or significantly improved products (goods and/or services), processes, new marketing methods, or new organisational methods -, and to its impact on resource efficiency and/or turnover. A wider impact is also expected in the medium-term.
Improve the business environment of the supported SMEs by establishing open collaboration spaces that can involve innovation actors from different sectors and countries. This will lead to the creation of new ideas for innovation and new collaboration partnerships, which will be subject of further development and with the potential for further impact on business turnover.

","25 November 2015","Scope:
Specific Challenge: Technologies and services as such do not have a specific value. Their value is determined by the business models used to bring them to a market.
Many current, widely applied business models, have developed for big companies and may be not-fitting or not-serving well the needs of SMEs nor be inspired by new knowledge on innovation in business models. In addition to this, small community-oriented companies, using their profits primarily for social objectives,[1] can build their growth on business model innovation.
The specific challenge addressed by this topic is to enable SMEs - in traditional sectors, such as manufacturing industries, in sectors of particularly rooted in Europe’s history such as cultural heritage as well as in new sectors including different services and creative industries, and the social economy – to innovate and grow across traditional boundaries, through new business models and organisational change. The international dimension is included. For instance, this can involve drawing on successful business models in different sectors in the global market, and developing them for use by European SMEs in the same or different sectors. It can also involve reverse innovation in business models, where models initially created in Europe and becoming successful elsewhere, are supported to return to Europe. For business model innovation in the broad area of food, it is foreseen to organize several events in the autumn of 2015 within an appropriate European level forum. Of particular importance for the new business models will be user-oriented services, cultural heritage related services, social services and tourism. The SME instrument, providing the phased approach and mentoring schemes needed, so that the participating SMEs can build successful strategies to achieve growth, is an appropriate instrument to address this challenge.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address the specific challenge of business transformation and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research.  For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annex.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected impact:
         Enhancing  growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative solutions
         Market uptake and distribution of innovations tackling the specific challenge(s) in a sustainable way.
         Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impact should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

Specific challenge: Technologies as such do not have a specific value. Their value is determined by the business models used to bring them to a market. The return on Europe's investments in technology and process development therefore depends not only on the overall framework conditions for innovation and entrepreneurship, but also on effective business models. However, many European enterprises, whether large or small and medium sized, lack awareness and tools to innovate their business models.  Against this background, the challenge addressed by this topic is to facilitate innovation in business models and allow a maximum number of companies to innovate their business models.
Scope: A business model describes how a company communicates, creates, delivers and captures value out of a value proposition. Current thinking summarises the functions of business models as: articulating the value created for users by the offering; identifying a market segment; defining the structure of the value chain required and the position of the firm in this value chain; formulating the competitive strategy. 
Innovation in business models mainly comes from new activities (content), new linkages between activities (structure) new markets (context) and/or new partners (governance). Inspiration for business model innovation can come, for instance, from business models developed in other business sectors (transfer) or from analyses of patterns in business models (system). Open innovation, emerging collaborative business models and new partnership mechanisms also mean innovation in business models for SMEs and bigger companies. Further research is needed on business model innovation and the successful implementation of business models. Within the scope of this research is to explore new knowledge how it happens and investigate access to this knowledge and the capacity of companies to adjust their existing business models.
The focus in addressing the specific challenge is therefore, with equal weight, on the following four dimensions:
advancing existing knowledge about business model innovation, e.g. by identifying patterns, exploring management structures, analysing  the potential of transfer across sectors and EU member states;
making this knowledge easily accessible;
developing mechanisms how to adjust the knowledge to individual companies, and
reaching out, possibly via existing channels, to a maximum number of companies.
Different models of ownership and different management structures, including those that make use of employee involvement and emphasise workplace innovation, are within the scope of this topic. Due attention should be given to the gender dimension in developing business models and multi-disciplinarity, as well as to the broader social and environmental aspects of business model development and implementation. Specific sectors can be targeted as long as  the transfer of business models across sectors is included in the approach. The aim is to turn into a self-sustainable platform after the end of the EU funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: This topic will advancecurrent understanding and awareness of business model innovation. It will produce new knowledge on business model innovation which will enhance European competitiveness and help address social challenges.  European companies, including SMEs, will examine and change their business models, adopting solutions that increase their competitiveness.
At least 10% of Europe's 20 million SME should be reached, including the micro-enterprises with up to 10 employees and achieving a broad geographical coverage across the European Union. The impact will also be an increase of Europe's attractiveness for innovators and contribution to the overall objectives of Innovation Union. At company level, it will help companies to develop new or strengthen existing business models and thus grow in terms of jobs and turnover.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific Challenge: The specific challenge addressed by this topic is, in the context of open innovation and science 2.0, to assist universities to become open innovation centres for their region in cooperation with companies, realising the ERA priorities, and to enable public administrations to drive innovation in and through the public sector.
Scope: The actions under this topic will help universities, companies and public authorities to enhance their capacity to engage in science 2.0 and open innovation. They will build or reinforce structures and mechanisms to support effective linkages for innovation between universities and companies and other employment sectors, and provide freely accessible innovation training platforms, including digital platforms.
The actions will be implemented by consortia that will commit to the ERA principles[1] and adopt innovative ways to create new knowledge, new jobs and promote economic growth. This challenge can be addressed through different sets of actions:
a) Inter-sectoral mobility
The actions should aim at:
      The development and implementation of a policy of double nominations of research staff in academia, companies and public and semi-public/CSO employment sectors.
      The development and implementation of a policy to further and recognise inter-sectoral mobility as a demonstrably positive career asset.
The new policies should be operational before the end of the EU funding and sustainable after the end of the EU funding.
b) Academia- Business/Public/CSO knowledge co-creation
The actions should aim to develop or (further) implement open innovative schemes to strengthen linkages between academia, industry and community. The aim is to accelerate pace and allow maximum socio-economic and environmental impact of scientific research, taking account of geographical coverage, societal needs and the needs of research communities, citizens and CSOs. This should take into account other EU actions, including the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions fostering inter-sectoral mobility.
Research institutions together with companies are expected to build sustainable structures which help to absorb needs of users and thereby become co-creators of new solutions. SMEs should be encouraged to participate.
The new policies should be operational before the end of the EU funding and sustainable after the end of the EU funding.
Gender aspects need to be taken into account.
c) Innovation leadership programme for public administrations and researchers
The actions should focus on developing curricula and providing freely through online platforms, possibly combined with other delivery mechanisms, innovation training for public administrations and researchers. The actions would go beyond state of the art training programmes and produce curricula and modules for a ‘deep-dive’ short leadership programme, supported by a sustainable platform or community of innovation trainers in order to create and run the leadership programme.
Identification of users' needs is of central importance. The R&D efforts required would involve exploration, design, development and piloting of pedagogies as well as methods and tools for collaboration and knowledge sharing, including MOOCs.
International aspects should be taken into account, while appropriate consideration should be given to the gender dimension in the design, development and delivery of the actions.
The new courses and platforms should be operational before the end of the EU funding and sustainable after the end of the EU funding.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.5 and 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
 Expected impact: The actions are expected to allow a wide range of research organisations to do better in areas which are essential to their performance as actors or facilitators of collaborative research and innovation. These organisations will be in a stronger position to interact fruitfully with innovators in industry and the public sector. Their increased potential to innovate will contribute to the socio-economic performance of the societies in which they operate. Universities will take a more prominent role in innovation, together with business and other actors, and thereby contribute to the objectives of the Innovation Union and ERA. The actions will also boost innovation competences in public administrations and equip researchers with innovation leadership knowledge, thereby creating more innovative societies.
a) Actions on inter-sectoral mobility are expected to increase the number of researchers with active experience in both academia and industry and thus foster fruitful interactions between the two sectors.
b) The actions on academia business co-creation will raise awareness of the potential of co-creation of new solutions and other open innovation activities. Interactions with various actors within the eco-system will also contribute to increased understanding of the culture and (potentially conflicting) objectives of partners.
c). The Innovation leadership programme and platforms, notably the online platforms, will enable public administrations and researchers to drive innovation with newly acquired skills relating to creativity, critical thinking, idea generation, visualisation and entrepreneurship. The actions will reach out to some 60.000 leaders throughout the EU, at central, regional and local level.
Knowledge sharing through the platforms will create more new ideas and innovative approaches. The actions will complement the European research base with innovation skills which are crucial for business and research in the global market. The actions will also foster the widest possible use of new training provision through standards on inter-operability, quality assurance and recognition of the training modules towards degrees of accredited universities.
Type of action:
a) and b) Coordination and support actions
c) Research and innovation actions
[1] Commitment to the ERA Principles implies that institutions:
       advertise of all vacancies on the EURAXESS Jobs portal using the common profiles established in the European Framework for Research Careers

The present Call for Proposals aims at funding projects on the topic of supporting the improvement of border surveillance by enhancing cooperation between Member States in the framework of EUROSUR, including, whenever appropriate, cooperation with third countries (especially neighbouring countries).
Project applications submitted under the present Call for Proposals must address at least one of the following priorities:
(1) Exchange of the situational pictures of neighbouring external border sections
In line with paragraphs 9 and 10 of Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1052/2013 establishing EUROSUR, the project shall enable the national coordination centres of two or more neighbouring Member States to share with each other, directly and in near-real-time, the situational picture of neighbouring external border sections, including:
a) incidents and other significant events contained in the events layer;
b) tactical risk analysis reports as contained in the analysis layer;
c) positions, status and type of own assets operating in the neighbouring external border sections as contained in the operational layer.
While the project proposal needs to fully cover the requirements described in letters a) and b), the requirements described in letter c) are optional. Project proposals covering also letter c) will be given priority over projects covering only letters a) and b).
(2) Support to Member States capacities to detect and track small vessels
The project shall enable two or more Member States to improve their technical or operational capability to detect, track and intercept non-cooperative vessels in a common area of interest with a view to preventing irregular migration and cross-border crime, as well as to reducing the loss of migrants' lives at the external sea borders.
Examples for improving the technical capability are
Combined use of at least two different sensors mounted on at least two different platforms (e.g. satellite, remotely piloted aircraft system, maritime patrol aircraft, aerostat, etc);
Combined use of surveillance and communication capabilities (e.g. use of satellite communication for video streaming from the maritime patrol aircraft to the coordination centre);
Technical upgrade of existing radar stations (e.g. passive radar) on condition that the radar picture is shared with at least one other neighbouring Member State.
Examples for improving the operational capability are
Integrated situational awareness, communication and coordination support tool for use at tactical/operational level, interlinking off shore patrol assets and coordination centres of two or more Member States, allowing them to exchange information, communicate and coordinate in real-time (e.g. positioning incidents and of assets, chat, video streaming).
(3) Cooperation with neighbouring third countries
The project shall support the cooperation between two or more Member States with a neighbouring third country with a view to preventing irregular migration and cross-border crime, as well as to reducing the loss of migrants' lives at the external borders.
These activities may include actions related to
developing, establishing, upgrading and maintaining bi-or multilateral information exchange and cooperation;

Specific challenge: The significant societal changes over the last decades and the emergence of new policies, e.g. on biodiversity, bioenergy and climate change (LULUCF accounting, adaptation) trigger the need to enhance the sustainability of a multipurpose EU forestry. The changing context is particularly sensitive for forests, as their lifetime spans over a large period, limiting the adaptation potential. To maintain the socio-economic, and environmental functions of forests, there is need improve the record of forest data, systems of monitoring and management models. This is currently challenged in the EU by the diversity of national and subnational systems of forest inventory, cartography, monitoring and planning, developed in the context of local/regional frameworks of policies and conditions, making the overall assessment of forest management and policy development, difficult. In addition to the work on harmonisation of forest data deriving from the existing national databases, and site-specific adaptive forest management (i.e. breeding, harvesting and wood utilisation), there is further need to close the remaining gaps in the recorded parameter space and provide for consolidated methodologies for estimation of forest data and improved data systems, and develop stand-related techniques and management models responsive to changing conditions on long term, conducive to increased wood production, while meeting the increasing societal demands and bioeconomy objectives.
Scope: Proposals should address one of the following issue (A):
A. [2014]Improved forest data
Proposals should contribute to improvement and harmonization of forest data flowing into European shared environmental information systems (e.g. EFDAC[1]), by means of national forest inventories and monitoring of sustainable forest management. Work on forest data should build on the existing experience of the Member States on forest inventories, monitoring systems and management planning, complement previous projects and COST Actions, such as USEWOOD (FP 1001), FORSYS (FP 0804) or E43, and make innovative use of field-collected data and EC space-based applications on Earth observation and satellite positioning systems (e.g. Copernicus, Galileo). Priority should be given to parameters supporting several policy areas and representative for multipurpose forest management, as well as to parameters previously not systematically collected, such as disturbances. Specific methodologies and products should be readily available for end-users, i.e. forest administration and management planning entities. Data generated during the project must conform to INSPIRE guidelines[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million for (A) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: Proposals should show how some, or all, of the following impacts will be achieved:
         Strengthening the methodological framework for more accurate and harmonized information derived from forest inventories and monitoring systems, above the present state of the art, able to feed into the EU information systems.
         Further support in the development of EU policies and international processes relying on consistent forest information, such as UNFCCC[1], and contribution to further development of GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) and the related GFOI initiative (Global Forest Observing Initiative).
         Forest management models geared to sustainable supply of wood for material and energy use, supporting further development of the bioeconomy.
         Forest stands resilient in a continuously changing environment (including climate change), while preserving the capacity to provide for NWFP and essential ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, water regulation, soil and nutrient regulation, and recreation.

B. [2015]Improved forest management models
Proposals should aim at the improvement of forest management models and stand-related techniques, including but not limited to species composition (including climate-adaptive genetics/breeding and assisted migration), age distribution, rotation/harvesting period, sustainable yields, restocking modalities (afforested land may also be analysed) and natural disturbances risk management. Management models should rely on consistent forest data and provide, in addition to improved wood quality and higher sustainable yields, sustained production of NWFP[1], increased resilience to environmental change, and sustained provision of the whole 'basket' of ecosystem services, in accordance with the evolving societal demands, changing market conditions, and regional differences. Procedures, methodologies and techniques characterising the newly developed models should be readily available for end-users (i.e. forest owners, administration and management planning), and deemed acceptable for the policy actors. Proposals should fall under the concept of 'multi-actor approach'[2].

","11 June 2015","Scope:
Specific challenge: The CO2 originating from the use of fossil resources continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, accelerating climate change with disrupting impacts on the biosphere. The chemical industry which heavily relies on these non-renewable and scarce fossil resources is looking for sustainable alternative resources to deliver the chemicals our society needs without the related environmental burden. While there are important scientific and technological challenges hindering the exploitation of CO2 as a chemical feedstock, it offers great potential to couple environmental protection and economic growth.
Scope:Proposals should address innovative technologies to use CO2 from the atmosphere or captured in industrial processes as a direct feedstock for chemical production beyond algal biorefinery concepts. One or several routes that involve the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals should be explored, such as (photo) catalytic or biochemical/enzymatic or other novel process technologies. Examples include the use of microbial electrosynthesis, the use of photosystems from plants outside the plant cells - or to construct artificial carbon fixation pathways that are more efficient than naturally occurring ones. The Technology Readiness Levels covered by the projects should range from 3 to 5; please see part G of the general Annexes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         Scientific and technological breakthroughs for the conversion of CO2 into chemicals which can lead to the design of industrial processes with zero or even negative greenhouse gas emissions;
         Providing at the long term real opportunity for regions where the biomass availability is less plentiful, as is the case in Europe.
Considering the rather front-edge character of the proposed field, the impact is expected to be in the medium to long term.

Specific Challenge: The potential for increasing demand for bio-based products through public procurement is huge, as European public authorities spend almost EUR 2000 billion, or 16% of GDP, on goods and services yearly. Many product areas could potentially feature products made entirely or partly from renewable bio-based material. Likewise, many types of services could potentially benefit from bio-based inputs.
By introducing requirements for sustainability in tender specifications, the demand from public authorities could significantly increase the market for bio-based products and drive technological innovation in this market area.
Scope: Proposals should undertake coordination and support activities to investigate the feasibility and prepare the launch of a Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI) on biobased products and services. Activities should include:
         The identification of procurement needs that are common to the participating public procurement bodies;
         Determining the state-of-the art of potentially available bio-based products of interest;
         Developing and promoting the use of common environmental and  functional/performance based requirements specifications, including the need for standardised measurement and testing methodologies, as well as  other approaches for criteria setting and their verification;
         Intensifying the link between public procurers and standardisation bodies sharing information and facilitating collaboration;
         Improving procurers knowledge and capabilities by joint trainings, workshops and other networking activities;
         Carrying out the necessary legal work to ensure that the procurement complies with European and national law;
         Engaging on public dialogue on bio-based products.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
         Lowering barriers and increasing bio-based products market segment by triggering demand for innovation through public procurement;
         Improving skills of public actors in designing procurement initiatives and increasing consumer awareness on bio-based products as well as developing decision making tools;

The role of SMEs to meet these challenges is critical as they are key players in the supply chains. Enhancing the involvement of weaker players in innovation activities as well as facilitating the start-up and emergence of new high-tech SMEs is of paramount importance.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address any area of the Transport Specific Programme (H2020 Specific Programme: Part III – 4. Smart, green and integrated transport), and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation a Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborated business plan either developed through phase 1 or another means. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project, including a first commercialisation plan, and criteria for success.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.
In addition, in phase 3, SMEs can benefit from indirect support measures and services as well as access to the financial facilities supported under Access to Risk Finance of this work programme.
Successful beneficiaries will be offered coaching and mentoring support during phase 1 and phase 2. This service will be accessible via the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches will be recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies. Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.

  Specific challenge: The European transport sector must have the capacity to deliver the best products and services, in a time and cost efficient manner, in order to preserve its leadership and create new jobs, as well as to tackle the environmental and mobility defies. The role of SMEs to meet these challenges is critical as they are key players in the supply chains. Enhancing the involvement of weaker players in innovation activities as well as facilitating the start-up and emergence of new high-tech SMEs is of paramount importance.
Scope:The SME instrument consists of three separate phases and a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 with a view to applying to phase 2 at a later date, or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed verifying the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management, innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept.
The proposal should give the specifications of the elaborated business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects will be supported that address any area of the Transport Specific Programme (H2020 Specific Programme: Part III – 4. Smart, green and integrated transport), and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research.

1. Priorities
This call will support three priorities:
1. Judicial cooperation in civil matters
The objective is to promote judicial cooperation in civil matters and to contribute to the effective and coherent application and enforcement of EU instruments.
Priority shall be given to projects aiming at better enforcement and practical application of civil justice instruments, in particular:
better enforcement of judicial decisions through better procedures, case-handling and cooperation in cross-border civil and commercial disputes;
improving the situation of children involved in civil cases, e.g. through better procedures, case-handling and cooperation in family law areas such as parental responsibility, international child abduction and maintenance;
improving and/or building-up data collection and statistics to support the practical application of EU civil justice instruments.
2. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters
The objective is to promote judicial cooperation in criminal matters and to contribute to the effective and coherent application of EU mutual recognition instruments in criminal matters.
a) Priority shall be given to the implementation and practical application of the following mutual recognition instruments:
Directive 2014/41/EU regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters;
Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States;
Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union;
Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions;
Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA on the application, between Member States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention;

the functioning of Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) Treaties or other Treaties containing provisions on MLA with third States (e.g. EU-US MLA Agreement, Budapest Cybercrime Convention), including with respect to the exchange of electronic data.
Proposals not in line with priorities 1 and 2 may still be awarded funding if applicants can justify this by the necessity to improve the implementation and application of the civil or criminal justice EU acquis on the basis of an evidence-based needs assessment, showing that more activities are required for the proper application of EU law in the field to be covered.
3. Support to the members of the European Judicial Network (EJN) in civil and commercial matters and to the national authorities, courts and professional associations they represent
The main objective is to contribute to the effective and coherent application of the EU acquis relating to judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters.
Priority shall be given to supporting the setting up and strengthening of national networks under the EJN in civil and commercial matters in order to ensure better implementation and case-handling under the civil justice legislation.
The aim of strengthened national networks is to promote better implementation of EU civil justice instruments through cooperation, dialogue, sharing of experience, exchange of information and training activities (where appropriate also in liaison with other national systems). Through these activities the national projects would promote full involvement of all national Network members, ensuring interaction at a national level as well as knowledge sharing and gathering of information. It can be expected that this would contribute to increasing the national substantial input to the Network's activities (in particular the Network meetings) and thereby strengthen the action and visibility of the Network as a whole. As a result, this would deepen EU-wide building bridges and mutual trust between different justice systems.

Priorities and activities to be co-financed
A. Priorities
1. Judicial cooperation in civil matters
The aim is to promote judicial cooperation in civil matters and to contribute to the effective and coherent application and enforcement of EU instruments.
Priority shall be given to projects aiming at better enforcement and practical application of civil justice instruments, in particular:
- better enforcement of judicial decisions through better procedures, case-handling and cooperation in cross-border civil and commercial disputes;
- improving the situation of children involved in civil cases1, e.g. through better procedures, case-handling and cooperation in family law areas such as parental responsibility, international child abduction and maintenance;
- facilitating cross-border successions through better cross-border cooperation, case-handling and awareness-raising2;
- improving cross-border circulation of public documents, including those on civil status through better information and awareness-raising3.
2. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters
The aim is to promote judicial cooperation in criminal matters and to contribute to the effective and coherent application of EU mutual recognition instruments in criminal matters.
a) Priority shall be given to the implementation and practical application of the following mutual recognition instruments:
- Directive 2014/41/EU regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters;
- Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States;
- Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union;
- Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions;
- Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA on the application, between Member States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention;
- Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties;
- Regulation (EU) 2018/1805 on the mutual recognition of freezing orders and confiscation orders.
b) Priority shall also be given to:
- the efficient contribution to the European Agenda on Security as regards the judicial responses to terrorism, notably on reinforcing the prevention of radicalisation, especially in prisons;
- issues related to pre-trial detention and alternatives to detention, in particular raising awareness of case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and recommendations of the Council of Europe in this field;
- the functioning of Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) Treaties or other Treaties containing provisions on MLA with third States (e.g. EU-US MLA Agreement, Budapest Cybercrime Convention), including with respect to the exchange of electronic data.
Proposals not in line with priorities 1 and 2 may still be awarded funding if applicants can justify this by the necessity to improve the implementation and application of the civil or criminal justice EU acquis on the basis of an evidence-based needs assessment, showing that more activities are required for the proper application of EU law in the field to be covered.
3. Support to the members of the European Judicial Network (EJN) in civil and commercial matters and to the national authorities, courts and professional associations they represent
The main objective is to contribute to the effective and coherent application of the EU acquis relating to judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters.
Priority shall be given to supporting the setting up and strengthening of national networks under the EJN in civil and commercial matters in order to ensure better implementation and case-handling under the civil justice legislation. Strengthened national networks can promote better implementation of EU civil justice instruments through cooperation, dialogue, sharing of experience, exchange of information and training activities (where appropriate also in liaison with other national systems). Through these activities the national projects would promote full involvement of all national Network members, ensuring interaction at national level, knowledge sharing and gathering of information, thus contributing to increasing the
national substantial input to the Network's activities (in particular the Network meetings) and thereby strengthening the action and visibility of the Network as a whole. As a result, this would deepen EU-wide building bridges and mutual trust between different justice systems.
4. Support to Member States for their connection to the ECRIS-TCN system
The ECRIS-TCN (European Criminal Record Information System – Third Country Nationals) system will replace costly requests currently addressed to all Member States by a more efficient search mechanism against both alphanumeric and fingerprint data of convicted third country nationals (TCN) to identify the Member State(s) holding criminal record information. Since it will be easier to identify the Member States which are the convicting ones, this will encourage more systematic use of ECRIS for TCN significantly increasing the current use of the system.
The main objective of this priority is to support projects implementing the needed adaptations of the national criminal records systems for the linking and exchange of fingerprints with the ECRIS-TCN central system.
B. Description of the activities
Whereas several measures and initiatives are listed, it is not requested to include all of them in a single project. Projects with a strong focus are very much valued. This topic will cover the following activities:
- facilitating cooperation between competent authorities and agencies, legal practitioners and/or service providers (including multi-disciplinary networks at international, national, regional or local levels);
- mutual learning, identifying and exchange of best practices, development of working methods which may be transferable to other participating countries;
- analytical activities, including data collection, surveys, research, etc.;
- exchange and provision of information and development of information tools;
- capacity building for professionals;
- dissemination and awareness raising activities;
- training activities can also be funded under this call, as long as they are of ancillary nature and not the main purpose of the project.
For priority 4, project activities would in principle include analytical, conceptual, design and elaboration work, IT software development, quality assurance and related auxiliary measures necessary for the establishment of new IT systems, as well as the expansion and adaptation of existing national solutions towards addressing the objectives of priority 4. Activities relating to project management, communication, promotion and dissemination are also eligible for funding.
Activities under this topic, especially where they relate to IT software development (priorities 1 and 4), will take into account existing solutions such as results from the e-CODEX project, CEF building blocks, and ISA2 Core vocabularies.
Activities must take place in countries participating to the JUSTICE Programme to be eligible for funding.
C. Expected results
Whereas numerous results are listed below, it is not expected for a single project to produce all of them. Projects bringing limited, but effective results are very much valued.
- Increased capacity of national practitioners, courts and authorities to address issues related to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to the application of the EU instruments on civil and civil procedural law, as well as on criminal and criminal procedural law;
- Strengthened cooperation and exchange of information between competent national authorities (including courts) in relation to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, including taking into account the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU);
- Improved knowledge on the legislation and administrative practices related to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters;
- Alignment of the Member States’ administrative practices in relation to the relevant legislation;
- Improved cooperation between judicial authorities in civil, commercial and criminal matters;
- For priorities 1 and 2, the legal framework and regulations linked to judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters are in line with EU acquis and relevant case-law of the CJEU;
- National authorities responsible for judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters cooperate and coordinate with other responsible agencies and institutions across the EU;

Priorities and activities to be funded
1. Priorities
The aim will be to promote judicial cooperation in criminal matters[1] and to contribute to the effective and coherent application of EU mutual recognition instruments in criminal matters[2]. Projects should aim to make these instruments work better in practice and provide practical tools to help practitioners dealing with these instruments and/or contribute to developing mutual trust between Member States. Proposals whose main purpose is to assess the transposition of these legal instruments into national law are not a priority of this call.
Priority shall be given to the implementation and practical application of the following mutual recognition instruments:
- Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002/584/JHA)[3];
- Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA of 24 February 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties[4];
- Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition for judgments imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty[5];
- Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions[6];
- Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA of 23 October 2009 on the application, between Member States of the European Union, of the principle of mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention[7];
- Directive 2011/99/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the European protection order[8];
- Directive 2014/41/EU on the European Investigation Order in criminal matters[9].
A specific priority shall be given to the implementation of the Directive on the European Investigation Order to ensure that mutual legal assistance (MLA)/mutual recognition proceedings are efficiently used between Member States' judicial authorities to effectively secure, request and obtain digital evidence in criminal investigations. Actions shall aim to improve cross-border cooperation and streamline the use of such procedures by developing guidelines and dedicated training modules on the efficient use of the current frameworks that are used for securing and obtaining e-evidence, including guidelines to clarify when, under the existing rules, using MLA or mutual recognition instruments are not required.
Projects may also examine the links between several of the mutual recognition instruments listed above, e.g. between the Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant and the Directive on the European Investigation Order.
Priority shall also be given to the functioning of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties or other Treaties containing provisions on Mutual Legal Assistance with third States (e.g. EU-US Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement), in particular with respect to the exchange of electronic data and financial information. Projects could in particular look at the following aspects:
- how to foster open communication with a view to speeding cooperation and proposing solutions, including increasing the use of electronic means;
- how to improve the identification of bank accounts and to involve Asset Recovery Offices and Financial Intelligence Units;
- how to reduce obstacles to the effective freezing, confiscation and recovery of the proceeds of crime and proposing recommendations to overcome them.
2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic.
This call will cover the following activities:
analytical activities, such as data collection, surveys, research activities, etc;
facilitating the exchange of data and the structured, confidential and data-protection compliant communication between the authorities appointed under EU legislation (e.g. competent authorities), including electronic transmission of documents, requests for information, questioning and hearing of persons across borders (such as by way of video-conferencing);
exchange of information and networking between judicial and administrative authorities and the legal professions and relevant civil society actors, such as development of an accessible and comprehensive source of country specific information and guidance on procedures, criminal codes, offences and legislation in each Member State; development of prototype templates to assist the issuing and executing authorities;
mutual learning, identifying and exchange of best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries;
dissemination and awareness raising activities.
Training activities can also be funded under this call, as long as they are of ancillary nature and not the main purpose of the project.
Projects ensuring maximum practical benefits and impact for the target groups will be more favourably assessed than theoretical projects consisting mainly of research and other analytical activities.

Priorities, activities to be co-financed and expected results
1. Priorities
The Commission is implementing a preparatory action[1] to create an EU fund for awareness raising and legal assistance to individuals and civil society organisations litigating democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights violations. The objective is to increase the awareness and knowledge of EU law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights (the Charter), and existing remedies and redress mechanisms to enforce them at national and European level.
To pursue the general objective to contribute to effective access to justice for all and a more effective and coherent implementation and application of EU law, including the Charter, the call sets the following specific objectives:
To strengthen the knowledge and ability of legal professionals and practitioners, including those working for civil society organisations and independent human rights bodies, to effectively engage in litigation practices at national and European level to improve access to justice and enforcement of rights under EU law, including the Charter, through training, knowledge sharing and exchange of good practices;
To support leverage activities, e.g. communication and campaigning, which help to raise awareness about rights, existing remedies and redress mechanisms.
2. Description of the activities
The success of strategic litigation initiatives rests on a comprehensive approach which requires specific skills and knowledge by all actors involved, in particular legal professionals and practitioners. Therefore, training activities, knowledge sharing and exchanges of good practices are needed to reinforce capacities and to strengthen cooperation among these actors. In addition, communication, campaigning and awareness raising activities are as important as the actual litigation to mobilise public opinion, to maintain individuals engaged throughout the process and to ensure the future enforcement of the decisions.
EU support can help build the capacity of relevant actors to develop this strategic approach to litigation practices in areas covered by EU law, including the Charter. This call for proposals therefore focuses on funding partnerships and activities benefitting legal professionals and practitioners who may assist or represent individuals wishing to litigate their rights under EU law, including the Charter, at national and European level, in particular through the following activities:
the development of practical learning tools and initiatives to increase the availability and uptake of specialised knowledge (e.g. thematic databases of jurisprudence);
the development and delivery of training and train the trainers modules for legal professionals (such as experts, lawyers and legal advisers) and practitioners;
the exchange of good practices, knowledge and skills, and mutual learning activities, including through the development of strategic partnerships and networks and awareness raising initiatives.
Activities must focus on the rights enshrined in the Charter and must be relevant for areas covered by EU law.
Activities must take place in the Member States of the European Union to be eligible.
Activities should not duplicate but demonstrate how they build on previous or ongoing EU-funded projects, when relevant.
Training activities for legal professionals and practitioners should use interactive modern training methodologies, getting inspiration from the Commission “Advice for training providers” and the good training practices advertised on the European e-Justice Portal.
3. Expected results
Increased awareness and knowledge by legal professionals and practitioners (including from civil society organisations and independent human rights bodies) about EU law including the Charter and existing remedies and redress mechanisms to enforce them at national and European level;
Increased awareness and knowledge by the general public of their rights under EU law including the Charter, existing remedies and redress mechanisms to enforce them at national and European level as well as awareness and knowledge about support available by legal professionals and practitioners;
Strengthened abilities of legal professionals and practitioners to cooperate and engage in litigation practices to assist individuals in making effective use of available remedies to enforce their rights under EU law, including the Charter, before national and European courts.

BACKGROUND
On 20 April 2020, the European Commission adopted the work programme for 2020 on the financing of pilot projects and preparatory actions in the field of ""Communications Networks, Content and Technology"".
Twenty-four official languages, some 60 regional and minority languages, as well as the languages of immigrants and important international trade partners determine the fabric of the EU’s linguistic landscape. Several studies and resolutions, as noted in the European Parliament resolution P8_TA-PROV(2018)0332 “Language equality in the digital age”, have found a striking imbalance in terms of digital language technologies. Only a few languages, such as English, French and Spanish, are well supported in the digital domain, while more than 20 official languages as well as many more regional and minority languages are considered to be in danger of digital extinction.
European human language technologies have the potential to overcome this linguistic divide in the digital sphere. To unleash their full potential, this pilot project will develop a strategic research, innovation and implementation agenda with a roadmap for achieving full digital language equality in Europe by 2030.
OBJECTIVES
The objective of this pilot project is to draw up a sustainable evidence-based strategic research agenda and roadmap setting out actions, processes, tools and actors to achieve full digital language equality of all languages (official or otherwise) used within the Union through the effective use of language technologies . The research agenda should lay out the current state of language technologies and language equality within the Union and give a detailed picture of the desired situation that is needed to achieve digital language equality. The roadmap will then provide the path and the means needed to implement the agenda and ensure that digital language equality becomes a reality by 2030.
Research agenda
The selected project will create a research agenda, which will:
Map relevant stakeholders and initiatives and liaise with them through public consultations and on-going dialogues;
Map relevant technologies, in particular based on artificial intelligence, assess their impact on the linguistic landscape and then analyse the conditions required to maintain and improve the required knowledge within Europe;
Identify key research areas and gaps in research that need to be addressed to ensure language technologies can overcome the linguistic divide;
Define the varying needs for language technologies (not only machine translation) across all the sectors that make up the European Digital Single Market and across languages used within the EU and its partner countries, but especially the lesser-used or under-resourced languages.
Roadmap for achieving digital language equality
In addition to the research agenda, the project will create a roadmap whose implementation will achieve digital language equality by 2030. This roadmap will define:
Tools, processes, actions and actors required to achieve full language equality for all sectors and stakeholders in the EU by 2030;
A reasoned prioritisation of actions to be taken, with clear milestones and accountabilities , to ensure the roadmap can be followed successfully and completed on time;
Key performance indicators for measuring progress/success in the implementation of the roadmap produced by the project;
How to ensure the knowledge and skills for implementing the roadmap remain within the Union to foster the EU’s technological sovereignty in this critical area;
A cost analysis of the funding requirements needed to ensure the roadmap can be successfully followed;
The necessary stakeholders and actors that need to be involved to ensure that by 2030 no European languages remain at risk of digital extinction.
Dissemination and awareness raising
An important aspect to successful implementation of the roadmap will be dissemination and awareness raising activities (including events, consultations, social media and dialogues). These will need to engage with all relevant stakeholders to ensure broad buy-in by the European language technology industry and research sectors, as well as with digital information providers and the citizen in general.
The aim of this project is to establish a practical, implementable and achievable agenda and roadmap, demonstrating the vast potential of digital language technologies for the broadest possible range of sectors and stakeholders. The engagement and dissemination activities therefore need to reach beyond long-standing actors in the language technology industry and draw in views and use cases from new stakeholders and sectors."

","Innovation action
","03 December 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
To accelerate the mass market take-up of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrids (PHEV), it will be necessary to increase the density of battery packs in terms of weight and package space in order to improve range and decrease weight. Moreover, shorter charging times for BEVs through high-power charging will enable travelling over longer distances, imposing further challenges on cooling needs. Higher performance of battery pack raises safety issues which require more robust and flexible advanced Battery Management Systems (BMS).
Besides research on advanced electro-chemistries and cell manufacturing, which are not part of this topic, the integration of battery rechargeable cells into battery packs plays an important role. However, the manufacturing of battery primary cells and their electrochemistry influences their shape and thermal behaviour and hence also the way how they can be integrated into modules and battery packs.
Advanced concepts of BMS relating to hardware and software enabling cell/module/pack communication need to be developed in order to maximise the performance of the final battery system used in vehicles. When aiming at large-scale production of high-density battery packs, manufacturing processes of modules, and their easy and efficient integration into packs need to take into consideration the choice of materials and requirements related to safety, quality, and fast and cost efficient fabrication.
Scope:
Proposals will have to address all of the following technical areas for passenger car applications (developed module concept scalability to delivery vans, heavy duty vehicles or busses would be beneficial, but not obligatory. Same applies to concept transfer between BEV and PHEVs):
Design of advanced battery packs and systems satisfying lightweighting, crashworthiness, electrical and thermal requirements using advanced lightweight materials improved packaging, integration and modularity while considering aspects of ecodesign for manufacturing and dismantling (including their automation), reuse (second life) and recycling/sustainability, leading to a global LCA improvement.
Development of specific solutions and processes for the sustainable dismantling and recycling of battery pack/modules and their materials, components and sub-systems taking into account safety and automation.
Flexible advanced battery management systems capable of being used on different types of packs and mid-sized vehicles with different use patterns, and underlying provision to be used in second life applications.
Advanced functionalities of battery management systems to enable control of modules and packs and their remote maintenance and troubleshooting, software updating and other functions. Safety and modularity aspects must be taken into account when increasing battery pack energy density. In addition, health and environmental aspects of advanced battery pack materials shall be considered over the lifecycle including cases of failure, and reuse/recycling.
Development of high voltage systems compatible with high-power ultra-fast charging and related implications, including high and low temperature charging, insulation, advanced models (including for instance data mining and big data on existing databases) for monitoring thermal state and estimation of application-dependant State of Health (i.e. in first and second use).
Development and qualification of future performance-related test procedures of developed functionalities under real-world conditions, incl. extreme environmental conditions.
Concept validation of battery performance functionalities at full scale should be demonstrated through pack integration into an existing vehicle (no vehicle development can be included in claimed costs) which should also serve as a benchmark of achieved performance.
Development and qualification of future safety related test procedures e.g. venting/management of gases, battery failure warning signals, thermal propagation.
The combination of achieved improvements with new components and functionalities on the vehicle and infrastructure sides coming from topics LC-GV-01-2018, LC-GV-02-2018 and LC-GV-03-2019) should allow the development of new concepts for affordable FEVs which enable long duration trips (e.g. 700-1000km day trips across different Member States) with not more than respectively 60-90 minutes additional travel time in comparison with ICE vehicles and without additional degradation impact on the FEV powertrain including the battery when used for max 10% of the charging events.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and 10 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Considerably improved performance of the EV through reduced battery system weight by 20% at constant electric vehicle range for mid-size battery electric car.
Overcome the uncertainty of range by achieving 25% shorter recharging time with a 150kW charger compared to best in class electric car available on the market in 2018. The demonstrator must have the same battery capacity as the reference car and meet the useful battery life mentioned below.
Improved attractiveness of the EV through achieving extended useful battery life to 300 000 km in real driving[1] referring to a mid-size passenger car using improved battery management, balancing and thermal management during high-power charging/discharging.
Contribution to Circular Economy goals through a minimum 20% Life Cycle Analysis improvement compared to existing products.
Considerably improved knowledge on module and pack sensorisation and thermal management.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Large battery packs are increasingly deployed to improve the efficiency and to eliminate emissions from waterborne transport. However waterborne transport batteries can be up to ten times more expensive than an automotive battery of equivalent capacity and their high cost is an important barrier to increasing the deployment of both hybrid and fully battery electric shipping. Unlike for other transport modes, the space, weight and consequently power density of waterborne transport batteries is usually of secondary importance within the systems total life cycle cost. Several factors contribute to the cost difference including production processes, safety certification, fire suppression, lower economies of scale and higher assembly costs. The challenge is to substantially reduce the cost of large waterborne transport battery systems and cells for both marine and inland waterway transport applications.
Scope:
Proposals can address either the battery cell or the battery system (racks, battery management system, fault detection and any integrated fire suppression) or both the cell and battery system.
All of the following aspects should be addressed:
With respect to waterborne transport, research and develop a large battery system and/or specific battery cells that are substantially cheaper on a total cost basis with respect to existing system.
Work should be applicable to battery systems of at least 1 MWh capacity.
Prove the technology and manufacturing processes through system trials and testing.
Address production process efficiency.
Address the requirements for type approval from relevant authorities including a comprehensive risk based safety assessment.
Development of a marine battery certification methodology with the objective of: validating and verifying safety (with consideration of air, liquid or passive cooling), including the standardisation of test methods and tools for certification cost reduction.
Considering of different vessel types, address the integration of battery systems into Energy/Power management system of vessel.
Undertake a cost benefit analysis to convincingly demonstrate the cost savings in comparison to current state of the art waterborne battery technology.
Assess end of life and disposal strategies.
Develop a convincing business case and consider potential financing models.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and 12 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
The principal impact should be to substantially reduce the lifetime cost of large waterborne battery systems and to enhance the competitiveness of European industry within the waterborne battery market. Cut greenhouse gas emissions from waterborne transport. Increase the European skills base in large battery technology and manufacturing processes. Support European jobs and growth. Increase confidence in waterborne battery technology investment. Speed up the transition of most short range freight and ferry services towards zero emission.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
International developments towards less air pollution and CO2 production are pushing towards a rapid implementation of electrification of transport. In addition, according to market forecasts, a rapid growth of the sales and deployment of battery electric vehicles (BEV) is predicted. Considering the global competition, the rush for better technology implies also the need for a better traction battery technology as a key enabling technology. Europe has to regain its competitiveness in markets that nowadays are dominated by non-European countries. This could occur by developing a new European owned battery technology.
Furthermore, an international tendency of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) is to consider more and more the solid state technology as a solution that could replace the current Li-ion technology based on liquid electrolytes. The reason is the need of higher energy density, but also of inherently safe batteries.
New chemistries, materials and production technologies have to be developed to strengthen the European industrial base, in line with the EU initiatives as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Implementation Plan for Action 7 ('Batteries') and in support of the Šefčovič battery initiative “EU Battery Alliance”, to be ready for market deployment by 2026.
This challenge is based on the results of previous calls and stakeholder consultations[1] and is supplementary to the topic published in the Sustainable Transport Challenge of 2019 on “Next generation of high energy density, fast chargeable lithium ion batteries”.
Scope:
Activities should develop further the current solid state battery technology and present solutions beyond the current state-of the art of solid state electrolytes that are suffering from various issues, e.g. a too high operating temperature, too low ion conductivity, too high impedance of the electrode electrolyte interface, short cycle life and lack of knowledge of suitable production technologies at a competitive cost. The ideal solid state battery and electrolyte would provide a solution for all these shortcomings.
Three dominant categories of electrolyte materials seem to emerge:
Inorganic electrolyte materials :
Inorganic crystalline materials (e.g. perovskites, garnets, sulphides, Nasicon, e.g. suffering from high interfacial resistance and poor interface contacts, problems during cell assembly and/or cycling due to reactivity between solid electrolyte and electrodes);
Inorganic amorphous materials (e.g. LiPON, glass oxides).
Solid polymers/polymeric materials (e.g. polyethylene oxide, PIL, single-ion, e.g. suffering from low ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, not suitable working temperature, Li dendrites) ;
All solid state hybrid systems (e.g. suffering from low polymer stability at high voltages, and/or knowledge on details and behaviour of the interface in the composite).
Solid state technology, according to a recent stakeholder proposal, has been classified in 2 sub-generations:
So called generation 4a with conventional Li-ion materials (as NMC/Si to be developed by 2020-2022) and
So called generation 4b with Li-metal as anode (to be developed by 2025-2030)
This call addresses all three main categories of electrolyte materials mentioned above, and includes also solid state batteries of the so-called ""post Lithium-ion"" batteries (generation 4a and 4b), as e.g. solid state forms of Li-S or Li-air.
The work should include:
Cell design;
Identification of problems and proposals of solutions to overcome issues hampering an optimal function of the specifically proposed electrolyte material(s) at bulk, surface, interface and grain boundary levels;
In depth interface optimization, characterization and integration, including multiscale modelling which should target in particular problems of the ion transport processes at the interfaces of the solid state battery system;
Demonstration of suitability to work with high voltage electrode materials, where applicable;
IP protection and know how creation. A solid analysis and description of the state of the art of specific R&I and the patent situation has to be included.
The developed cells should meet the typical EV operating conditions in a broad temperature range, i.e. 10 to 50 ºC. Moreover, the cells should demonstrate negligible loss of charge during lengthy standby periods at sub-zero temperatures. Fast charging requirements of BEV should be met. Cyclability should be suitable for application in BEV.
The choice of the electrolyte to be developed should be duly justified in terms of chances of market success in the coming years. Validation of a pre-industrial prototype in relevant industrial environment should include an assessment of the scale-up potential in view of large scale manufacturability.
The TRL level of the project should start at TRL 3 and reach TRL 6 at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
For generation 4a, an energy density >350 Wh/kg and >1000 Wh/l, for generation 4b a higher energy density >400 Wh/kg and >1200 Wh/l ;
Fast charge rates above 10C with power density values >10000 W/kg as 2030 target;
Proven safety;
IPR protection guaranteed and demonstrated;
Cost euro < 100euro/kWh;
The European materials modelling capacity and ecosystem should be increased;
The European battery value chain towards cell production in Europe should be strengthened.
Relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be clearly stated in the proposal.
The proposal has to do a thorough Life Cycle Analysis cradle to cradle and consider recycling as far as possible.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Advanced batteries are expected to play a major role in electricity grid management in systems with a high share of renewable electricity. The need for simultaneously providing multiple services (e.g. artificial inertia, frequency regulation, renewables balancing, load levelling, backup power and longer-term energy storage) requires compromises between power needs and energy needs. Hybrid battery systems can provide the ability to optimise power/energy performances by the combination of different technologies. Such hybrid systems would reach better business cases by mixing the contribution to different services and/or products. This challenge is in line with the identified priorities in the context of the SET-Plan [1].
Scope:
The objective is to develop and demonstrate optimised innovative battery storage systems based on hybridisation. The resulting storage system can be engineered either by the twinning of distinct systems, or internal hybridisation of cells and control systems. Focus should be on cell and stack design, on advanced battery management systems and on high-level, hybrid storage control systems. The hybrid storage systems may for example be optimised for one or more of the following applications:
Stand-alone provision of services to the interconnected pan-European grid
Provision of services to island grids
Provision of services in weak distribution grids
Provision of services in private grids such as industrial parks
Provision of load levelling for EV charging service stations.
The activities are expected to bring the technologies from TRL 4 to TRL 6 (please see part G of the General Annexes). The battery systems should have optimal sustainability throughout the entire supply chain, including the substitution of critical raw materials. The systems should be demonstrated in a relevant environment and at a scale that allows future business cases to be developed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Increased competitiveness of electrical energy storage by balancing power needs with energy needs, providing a more efficient system with a longer and better performing lifespan, and by optimising balance-of-plant and installation costs. Project results should put the energy storage cost on the path to fall below 0.05 €/kWh/cycle by 2030.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The active role of citizens and their direct involvement is essential to address climate change and other human actions harming the environment on land, air and sea. Changes in citizen’s and consumer’s behaviours towards more sustainable patterns can happen through education, awareness raising, citizen science, observation and monitoring of their environmental impacts, civic engagement and social innovation. It is essential to directly involve citizens and communities in contributing to climate action and protecting the environment, thereby encouraging them to change their personal behaviour and their mindsets, reducing their carbon and environmental footprint and taking action at the individual and collective level. This would lead to a more sustainable lifestyle and relationship to the environment.
A strong emphasis is placed on strengthening environmental awareness of the young generation through education and other forms of youth engagement. Pupils and students have the potential to become ambassadors for climate action, sustainable development and environmental protection by sharing their knowledge, experience and engagement with their families, local communities, public and private decision makers, as well as through communication and the use of social media. As recommended in the European Green Deal Communication[1], schools, training institutions and universities are well positioned to engage with pupils, parents and the wider community on the changes needed for a successful transition to a green economy. A European competence framework is needed to help develop and assess knowledge, skills and attitudes on climate change and sustainable development. Related demonstration activities on for example nature-based solutions, biodiversity conservation, waste management, sustainable energy production and consumption, marine science, etc. will support the testing and the implementation of the framework.
Citizen science is a powerful tool for climate action, sustainable development and environmental protection through civic engagement. Citizen science should be understood broadly, covering a range of different levels of participation, from raising public knowledge of science, encouraging citizens to participate in the scientific process by observing, gathering and processing data, right up to setting scientific agenda and co-designing and implementing science-related policies. It could also involve publication of results and teaching science. Citizen science activities should be based on a robust scientific methodology ensuring the quality of the data collected and a fair representation of all stakeholders involved. Citizen science will help to raise awareness, to educate in science, to increase understanding of scientific processes and scientific literacy. It will also provide new tools and data for environmental monitoring, covering a broad European geography. Citizen science can strongly contribute to the delivery of environmental data with a significant potential for further broad use, including contributing to improving relevant European policies. It will have real-life impact through adaptations in citizen/consumer personal behaviours.
Initiatives should be coherent with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the European Climate Pact[2] and the European Biodiversity Strategy for 2030[3] to engage citizens and communities in action addressing climate change, sustainable development and environmental protection. The proposed activities will build on existing initiatives and practices that demonstrate at international, European, national, regional and local level innovation in teaching and learning methods and how to engage the wider community in the changes needed for a successful and just transition. For example, experience can be learned from the European Ocean Literacy platform[4], the European Atlas of the Seas[5], the Plastic Pirates initiative[6], the citizen science platform[7], the Horizon 2020 project TeRRIFICA[8], Scientix[9], School Education Gateway[10], resources for nature-based solutions in education[11], UNESCO experience in Education for Sustainable Development[12], as well as cultural, creative and artistic activities as a tool for empowering citizens.
Scope:
Actions under this topic should address one the following two subtopics:
Subtopic 1: Enabling citizens to act on climate change and for sustainable development through education
Based on the recommendations of the European Green Deal Communication, actions will foster the development and implementation of a multidisciplinary European competence framework within the context of lifelong learning for the development and assessment of knowledge, skills and attitudes of citizens and in particular young people on climate change and sustainable development.
This framework shall be built on the best available research and rooted in the Council Recommendation on Key Competences for lifelong learning[13], especially natural science, technology, mathematics, as well as social, personal, entrepreneurial, citizenship and digital competences. The participation of natural scientists, technology specialists, citizen science professionals and social sciences and humanities researchers is essential for the development of the framework. Taking into account the natural resistance to individual behavioural changes and to collective changes in social practices, as well as the gender gap observed in attitudes towards ecology and sustainable practices, contributions and practical knowledge provided by non-academic practitioners, NGOs and stakeholders, and international best practices, will be important.
The European competence framework will be tested and validated through demonstration activities, in particular in schools, training institutions and universities, as for example through the implementation of nature-based solutions (e.g. green walls, green ponds for natural water filtering, green roofs, air quality sensors, green mobility, etc.), actions for biodiversity conservation, education on natural disasters, waste management including marine and riverside litter, sustainable energy and food production and consumption, educational activities supporting the refurbishment of school buildings, etc.
Under this subtopic, clustering activities among the selected projects should be ensured through regular exchanges (e.g. meetings, peer-learning and peer-counselling activities, etc.) in order to share the educational outcomes on the competence framework, best practices and results of the different demonstration sites. To this end, proposals should earmark the appropriate resources for coordination activities accordingly. Each proposal should also reflect a balanced geographical representation of the demonstration sites covering different regions in Europe.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the European Union in the range of EUR 3 to 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Subtopic 2: Enabling citizens to act on climate change and for sustainable development through better monitoring and observing of the environment and their environmental impacts
Actions in this subtopic will target the involvement of citizens in climate- and environment-related issues and domains, such as biodiversity, marine and freshwater pollution, water scarcity and sustainable transport and food production. They will focus on the active participation of citizens through citizen science, environmental observation and civic consortia. Projects should be conducted on a broad scale, i.e. in cooperation with businesses, civil society organisations, public authorities and existing initiatives (such as the Climate Adapt platform[14] and the Covenant of Mayors[15]), to ensure that these actions will lead to examples on how to engage the wider community in the effective behavioural changes and changes in social practices needed for a successful and just transition. The key component of this subtopic is to raise awareness, engage and empower citizens and consumers with concrete tools to monitor their impacts on the environment, to collect information enabling them to change their behaviour and to reduce their personal carbon and environmental footprint as user and consumer through individual and social innovation. Actions should include the development and/or improvement of devices (low-cost sensors, consumer apps, such as wearable sensors, a trusted user-friendly app with robust carbon footprint calculations, extreme weather community app, for the purposes of early warning, marine and freshwater litter watch) taking into account the interoperability and exchange of future and existing data collected. Attention should be paid to promoting gender-equal participation and deconstructing gender stereotypes.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the European Union in the range of EUR 3 to 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Grants will be awarded to proposals according to the ranking list. However, in order to ensure a balanced portfolio of supported actions, at least the highest-ranking proposal per subtopic will be funded, provided it attains all thresholds.
Expected Impact:
The project results are expected to contribute to:
Subtopic 1:
a multidisciplinary European competence framework within the context of lifelong learning that will serve as a reference tool for the Member States, the public and private sector, stakeholders, and NGOs to help citizens to become engaged actors in the green transformation of society;
The ability to assess the knowledge, skills and attitudes of citizens and in particular young people on climate change, sustainable development and environmental protection;

","22 September 2020
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The European Green Deal expects to transform Europe into a fair and prosperous society with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050. To decarbonise Europe, land-based and offshore renewables must become the main energy source, while keeping the stability and resilience of the European Energy System. Research and Innovation is still needed to be able to achieve a full system transformation and to realize the ambition of other EU policies like the Clean Planet for all, the SET-Plan, and the New Circular Economy Strategy and to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (in particular SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.
Given that the topic contains two subtopics, the specific challenge for the first one, about the development of land-based renewable energy technologies and their integration into the energy system, includes in particular the following:
Renewable energy-based systems for district heating and cooling (DHC) and for cogeneration of heat and power (CHP) can play a key role in energy system integration, and make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy system. The Energy System Integration Communication points as one of the solutions towards an acceleration of smart, highly-efficient, renewables-based district heating and cooling networks[[COM2020(299) https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/energy_system_integration_strategy_.pdf. Renewable energy-based DHC and CHP systems that are at the same time robust, reliable and flexible to respond to peak demands require effective and efficient combinations of different renewable energy sources in the same system. This is because for example solar thermal technologies are challenged by sunshine hours, bioenergy by biomass availability and geothermal heating by geology, hydrology and land availability. Research and innovation are necessary to develop the renewable energy-based DHC and CHP systems of the future that are secure, cost-effective, affordable and robust to renewable energy fluctuations. These innovative approaches will have to take into account the specific conditions of the different geographical regions of Europe. Digital solutions can be an important enabler for the operation of multi-source DHC and CHP networks.
Similarly, the specific challenge for the subtopic on demonstration of innovative technologies to enable future large scale deployment of offshore renewable energy includes in particular the following:
The Commission’s long-term strategy, A Clean planet for all, identifies offshore renewable technologies, amongst others, as a key energy system for the Clean Energy Transition. It provides estimates for the offshore wind capacity in Europe of 240-440 GW by 2050, compared to about 22 GW today, while other offshore renewables follow a more modest scenario. This increase would represent a paradigm shift in the European energy system and require a modern infrastructure to seamlessly integrate the power of offshore resources in the energy system via the grid to onshore, or via the option of power-to-X taking into account grid constraints, investments and evolving /new energy market design.
This buildout needs to ensure cost efficiency and to foster the green economy, while protecting the environment and biodiversity, and assuring a just transition. There is a need for more efficient, cost-effective, affordable and secure technologies using wind, solar, wave and/or tidal resources, considering the potential of the different European sea basins (Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea) and the complementarity of resources to reach the best capacity factor and optimized use of all the power equipment. At the same time, developed solutions should ensure resource efficient use of raw materials, in particular critical raw materials.
Scope:
Proposals should address one of the following two subtopics and clearly indicate which subtopic is addressed
Subtopic 1 (Research and Innovation action): Development of land-based renewable energy technologies and their integration into the energy system
Projects should develop innovative solutions for either district heating and/or cooling systems or CHP, which allow satisfying a significant or possibly total share of the energy demand by means of combining different highly efficient land-based renewable energy sources. Projects should combine at least two or more renewable energy sources and/or two or more renewable energy technologies. The seasonal loads of the DHC or daily/seasonal loads of the CHP system (for example when coupled to an industrial process), and the daily/seasonal availability of the renewable energy sources have to be properly taken into account. Projects should assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental, social and economic terms.
For DHC systems, the integration of sources of otherwise wasted excess heat or cold as well as the interfacing with existing heating or cooling distribution networks can be considered. For CHP solutions, the minimum capacity in terms of power supply should be 2,5 MW and the electrical efficiency is expected to go well beyond the state of the art. The optimization in terms of energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proposed solutions, as well as the adaptability to existing systems for a representative variety of network conditions in the EU should be addressed. Projects should assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental, social and economic terms and should also take into account the requirements of the final users.
Projects should bring the proposed solutions to TRL 4-5.
In order to ensure a balanced portfolio, at least the highest ranking proposal addressing CHP and DHC will be funded, provided it attains all thresholds.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Subtopic 2 (Innovation Action): Demonstration of innovative technologies to enable future large scale deployment of offshore renewable energy
Projects must demonstrate at sea critical offshore renewable energy innovations considering the efficiency, reliability, scalability, sustainability and circularity that is needed in all areas of the offshore renewable energy system, notably:
Offshore renewable energy power generating systems: innovative integrated offshore (floating) wind, wave, tidal and/or solar systems, on a floating or fixed-bottom substructure, considering the varied subsea and metocean conditions.
And/or
Grid infrastructure: real life demonstration of innovative Direct Current (DC), AC/DC hybrid technologies and systems as a supporting step towards large offshore DC, AC/DC hybrid grids (e.g. multi-vendor Multi-Terminal HVDC (MT HVDC) systems, grid forming converter, HVDC diode rectifiers, Modular Multilevel Converters (MMC), DC Circuit Breaker (DCCB); DC/DC converter and DC/power hub) and their control and management systems; for floating renewable energy technologies: innovative dynamic inter-device/inter-array cables and connections to converter stations at sea or offshore hubs.
In order to ensure a balanced portfolio, at least the highest ranking proposal addressing Offshore renewable energy power generating systems and the highest ranking proposal addressing Grid infrastructure will be funded, provided it attains all thresholds. This condition to ensure a balanced portfolio will also considered to be met if one project addressing both aspects will be funded. Furthermore, projects may also include:
Power to X /battery/ storage systems: innovative offshore storage, battery and/or power to X systems to maximise the use of offshore resources and increase the system resilience.
The innovative demonstration actions might be part of a larger project or already making use of existing infrastructure. Multi-functional platforms can be considered.
Proposals should address also the following:
Industrial design and manufacturing processes, circularity of (critical) raw materials, scalability,, installation methods, transport, operation & maintenance, supply chains and the related digital infrastructures.
Regulatory, market and financial challenges.
Marine spatial planning issues (making multi-use of the seas possible, but also considering optimising environmental impacts) as well as currently known barriers such as costs, public acceptance and vulnerability to changing climate conditions in offshore areas, and considering needs, values and expectations of society through close and continuous discussion with stakeholders.
Projects are requested to demonstrate the technologies at sea while respecting existing environmental regulatory framework.
Present an environmental monitoring plan to be implemented during the demonstration action.
The project consortium should demonstrate how it contributes to knowledge building and innovation. Development of new knowledge, models and solutions are paramount to maximize the benefits of the energy transition, to ensure that the right choices are made, and to optimize technologies and systems.
The project has to include a clear go/no go moment ahead of entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go moment, the project has to deliver the detailed engineering plans, a complete business and implementation plan and all needed permits for the deployment of the project. The project should clearly demonstrate a proposed pathway to obtaining necessary permits for the demonstration actions and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project should also demonstrate how it will get a financial close for the whole action. Independent experts will assess all deliverables and will advise for the go/no-go decision.
The project should bring the demonstrated technologies to TRL 7.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 20 to 35 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Funding for proposals being part of a larger project will be related to the eligible costs based on the innovative part of the project.
Expected Impact:
Subtopic 1: Development of land-based renewable energy technologies and their integration into the energy system
Projects will bring clear benefits in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutants emissions and the use of fossil fuels. They will also demonstrate that an affordable, reliable, secure and flexible DHC and/or CHP systems based on onshore, local renewables can be designed to be adaptive and scalable according to the energy demand.
Subtopic 2: Demonstration of innovative technologies to enable future large scale deployment of offshore renewable energy
The project should clearly demonstrate all potential impacts on the future roll-out of large-scale deployment of offshore renewable energy, the market perspective considering existing or alternative (decentralised) systems and all other environmental (like GHG reductions), ecological, social and economic impacts along the value chain.
It should increase incentives for investment and economies of scale in offshore bringing down costs and create new business models and services.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This action responds to the Joint Communication for a Comprehensive Strategy with Africa[1] adopted on 9/3/2020, which highlights that innovation is key to enable African countries to pursue sustainable pathways to development through a low-carbon, climate resilient and green growth trajectory, leapfrogging fossil fuel technologies. It will contribute to the present R&I Partnership on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy of the EU/AU High-Level Policy Dialogue[2] on Science, Technology and Innovation that is expected to strongly contribute to Action 1 of the Comprehensive Strategy with Africa.
The African continent has an enormous renewable energy potential which just began to be harnessed successfully. The adoption of innovative, affordable and efficient renewable energy solutions will support Africa in achieving sustainable development growth and economic transformation.
Africa still faces major challenges related to ensuring access to energy for all and beyond, to the development of its industrial base to create much-needed jobs. In line with the Africa-Europe Alliance[3] for sustainable investment and jobs, the EU-AU R&I Partnership on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy aim to support the development of sustainable energy solutions appropriate to the African context that will address these challenges.
Experience has shown that existing innovative solutions and technologies generated for developed markets need to be adapted and tailored to, and demonstrated in, the multi-faceted context of Africa. The goal is to bring not only economic, but also environmental, social and health benefits. To facilitate market uptake and sustained deployment of technologies, R&I policies need to be coupled with capacity building and appropriate financing solutions. Additional considerations of affordability, suitable distribution channels as well as meaningful engagement with civil society in the implementation of research projects are also key for the success of potential technological solutions. The involvement of private and/or public European and African investors to sustainable energy solutions is key to the sustainable economic development of Africa with benefits to both continents.
Significant efforts are being made (including with the support of the European Commission) to address the development of innovative solutions through research and innovation actions. However, demonstrations of the value of these solutions are still needed.
Scope:
Actions should demonstrate innovative sustainable energy solutions that consider climate adaptation and mitigation potential compared to other technologies/solutions in the African social, economic and environmental contexts. The solutions may address:
development of renewable energy sources, including solutions for off-grid communities, and their integration into the existing energy system, considering the generation of renewable energy, the transmission, and the use of storage/battery systems.
energy efficiency
Solutions should consider both urbanised and rural contexts in Africa, and the ongoing water-energy-food nexus action, with the aim of providing sustainable energy access (electricity/cooking) and/or creating improved health, economic wealth and jobs (productive use of energy/energy efficiency).
Actions should design, construct, commission and operate the demonstration installation. Actions should also develop and implement a tailored value chain approach, identifying the most suitable manufacturing value chains, on the basis of the local context, local material supply chain(s) and local workforce, with the objective of ensuring sustainable local economic development. Actions should also include the identification of technical, vocational and educational needs of the workforce and propose relevant training and qualification activities. Actions should finally define a market and business strategy to ensure impact through a quick and viable commercial take-up of the technological solution demonstrated.
Proposals should include a life cycle analysis showing the impact of the proposed solutions compared to other technologies/solutions on the environment, on climate change targets and on the social and the economic dimensions, taking a cradle to grave viewpoint. Where relevant, proposals should consider adopting a circular economy approach, aligned with the European Green Deal[4] priorities.
In line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. As the demonstration installation will be located in Africa, relevant African partners have to participate in the implementation of the project. A balanced consortium between European and African partners will be considered an asset in the evaluation.
Copernicus[5] data and products (focussed on available hydro, wind, solar or marine energy resources) may also support life cycle analysis to evaluate the impact on humans and the environment (including impact on biodiversity) these new energy plants.
Actions should also participate in and contribute to the EU/AU Partnership on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy, in particular through cooperation/collaboration with the project to be funded under the topic LC-SC3-JA-5-2020, “Long Term EU-Africa Partnership for Research and Innovation actions in the area of renewable energy”.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The demonstrators should provide evidence of the following short-term expected impacts:
technologically reliable and economically viable solutions;
proven positive environmental, health, climate, social and economic impacts of the renewable energy solutions, by putting in place measures and mechanisms in line with the highest European Environmental and Social standards (see ESIA procedure), and taking into consideration the upcoming taxonomy principles and mechanism;
climate adaptation and climate mitigation potential of the solutions compared to other technologies/solutions;
strengthening of the joint EU-AU Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Partnership efforts, with emphasis on improving the visibility of EU Science Diplomacy actions in Africa.
The following medium term impacts are expected:
creation of new market opportunities for both European and African companies on the African continent;
technological uptake on the African continent;
acceleration of the achievements of the African continent’s targets of the Paris Agreement, in line with Europe’s Green Deal ambition of climate neutrality, and its external dimensions.
Longer term impacts expected:
economic growth and job creation, both in the EU and in African countries.
In addition, the proposed solutions are expected to evidence benefits to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals[6] 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The European long term decarbonisation strategy (LTS) “A Clean Planet for All” published by the European Commission in November 2018 refers to the potential key role of hydrogen in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, such as industry, cement, steel, and also contributing to decarbonisation of heavy duty and long distance transport.
To help achieve the climate neutrality objective, hydrogen needs to be produced at large scale, mainly through electrolysis powered by renewable electricity. The LTS scenarios achieving climate neutrality envisage an installed electrolyser capacity ranging between 400 and 511 GW by 2050 in the EU. However today the technology is only available at multi-MW scale (a 20 MW electrolyser project is being implemented through the co-funding of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, under the call 2018).
In order to reach the GW scale, an important milestone would be the development and demonstration of a 100MW electrolyser.
The challenge for this topic is to develop larger modules than the state of the art, with reduced balance of plant, managing efficiently the input power, the output hydrogen and oxygen streams, as well as the heat flows, while ensuring the reliability of the system and reducing the footprint through a more compact design. It is expected that the development of bigger modules will help create economies of scale, thus leading to further cost reductions.
The modules will then be assembled into a 100MW electrolyser system, which will be tested and demonstrated in real life conditions, operating flexibly to harvest maximum renewable power. The system will provide grid-balancing services as well as supplying renewable hydrogen to a commercial/industrial application. The hydrogen purity should meet the hydrogen market requirements. The output pressure should be designed to fulfil, when possible, the required pressure for the hydrogen application targeted - including buffer storage needs if any - and reduce as far as possible the need for dedicated hydrogen compression units downstream. The performance and the durability of the electrolyser operating dynamically need to be assessed and potential safety issues addressed.
The activities related to the development of test methodologies, protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of electrolyser components could envisage a collaboration with JRC in order to support the EU-wide harmonisation of testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify technology progress. Where possible, the collaboration with JRC could include electrolyser component testing.
Scope:
The scope of this project is to install and operate a 100 MW electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen, as energy carrier or as a feedstock. Specific activities are:
The main activity will consist of:
Development, installation and operation a 100 MW electrolyser for managing and using efficiently renewable energy, water, Hydrogen and Oxygen flows;
Demonstrate the increased usage and economic impact of RES mix, addressing potential curtailment issues in Demand Response operation (if grid connected) or island mode functioning (if dedicated to hydrogen production);
Operation of an electrolyser system in real life conditions in an industrial or port environment, for example feeding a mobility hub, a fertiliser production plant, a synthetic fuel production plant, a refinery, biorefinery or other industries, or injecting in natural gas transmission/distribution grid;
Investigate possibility to make use of rejected heat or vented Oxygen;
Operating pressure should be suitable for the application & any buffering / compression requirements.
Other activities will consist of economic, safety, social/societal impact and environmental assessments:
Demonstration of the future economic viability of the technology depending on cost of electricity and hours of operation of the electrolyser. The effect of intermittent generation on the cost-effectiveness of large electrolysers should be taken into account;
Reduce footprint and address potential health and safety issues;
Evaluation of the environmental performance of the system, notably in terms of GHG emissions reduction in line with the methodology of the Renewable Energy Directive II and in terms of water consumption;
Evaluation of other ecological and societal benefits along the value chain;
The project should help develop a European value chain by building on technology and business concepts developed by European companies.
Mandatory knowledge sharing activity:
Cross border dimension and knowledge sharing within Europe: as part of mandatory activities, organise 3 workshops, out of which at least 2 in European countries, outside of the beneficiary’s main implantation, involving policy makers and energy stakeholders, to share knowledge on experience gathered and replication of experiences.
Contribute to addressing common challenges, information (like reporting on impact indicators) and dissemination activities through cooperation with other relevant projects funded by the European Commission in the context of this call.
To ensure that projects jointly contribute to energy system integration, and create synergies and supply chains for Hydrogen, through synergies between, and to enhance the visibility of H2020 supported actions, projects are requested to reserve a small part of their funding to such cooperation.
The knowledge to be shared will cover the whole project cycle including project management, procurement, permitting, construction, commissioning, performance, cost level and cost per unit performance, environmental impacts, health and safety, as well as needs for further research and development.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 25 - 30 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Due to the nature of the supported developments that undertake innovation activities in a market environment, funding rate is reduced to 50%. Funding for proposals being part of a larger project will be related to the eligible costs based on the innovative part of the project. The topic aims to support different electrolysis technologies.
Projects should have a duration of 5 years, with at least 2 years of operation. Capital equipment can be amortised outside the 5 years of the grant duration.
Combination with other EU or national financing instruments will be incentivised, namely the usage of financial instruments to de-risk the operational activity, covering the hydrogen off-take in particular in the ramping-up of the project. The grid connection costs, building costs and the electricity costs for the commissioning phase are eligible for funding. Electricity costs during demonstration / business operation are not eligible.
The project has to include a clear go/no go decision point ahead of entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no go decision point, the project has to deliver detailed engineering plans, a complete business and implementation plan and all the required permits for the deployment of the project. A committee of independent experts will assess all deliverables and will give advice on the go/no go decision.
Expected Impact:
The proposed topic of the call for proposals is expected to have the following impacts:
Technological impacts:
Establish a European industry capable of developing novel hundreds of MW electrolysers using a European value chain, consisting of modules and a suitable balance of plant for managing power (electricity and heat), water, Hydrogen and Oxygen flows;
Increase the efficiency of the electrolyser reaching an energy consumption of 49 (ALK) to 52 (PEM) kWh/kg H2 at nominal power;
Increase the current density to at least 0,5A/cm2 (ALK) or 3A/cm2 (PEM) and delivery pressure to 30 bar. Power electronics should allow for dynamic operation of electrolyser from 25 to 100% in seconds (following the JRC harmonised testing protocols);
Reduce the plant’s footprint by 30% thanks to the larger modules and the plant layout as well as the higher current densities;
Reduce the electrolyser CAPEX by 20% down to EUR 480/kW and EUR 700/kW for Alkaline and PEM electrolysers respectively, meeting the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking targets for 2024;
Increase the stack lifetime with a degradation target (Minimum nominal energy consumption at end of Life) of 0.12%/1000 hours for Alkaline and 0.19%/1000 hours for PEM;
Improve the overall efficiency valorising also by-product heat (e.g. for space heating).
Operational and environmental impacts:
Demonstrating feasible operation of 100 MW-scale electrolysis and the use of the produced hydrogen in an application valorising the renewable character of the produced hydrogen;
Assessment and operational experience, including safety, of the contractual and hardware arrangements required to distribute and supply hydrogen to the specific industrial and/or transport market;
Assessment of feasibility to connect the electrolyser to a production site of renewable sources of energy such as offshore/onshore wind, or solar plants;
Technical assessment of the suitability of the electrolyser equipment to operate in its expected environment and suggestion of best practices;
Evaluation of the environmental performance of the system (in alignment with RED II compliant methodologies) – with attention to the CO2 intensity of the hydrogen produced versus Natural Gas route, which should include an understanding of the CO2 impact of the grid services mode selected and CO2 footprint impact in the addressed hydrogen end-user markets;
Evaluation of other ecological and societal benefits along the value chain.
Cost competitiveness impacts:
Demonstrate a compelling economic and environmental case, including boundary conditions, for key applications such as transport, energy storage, raw material (hydrogen and oxygen) or heat and power production. For a LCOE of up to EUR 40/MWh (renewable sources), achieve a significant cost reduction of green hydrogen compared to the price at the time of proposal submission striving for below EUR 3 /kg and aim for further reductions possibly also by generating income from the provision of services to the electricity grid (e.g. balancing or frequency services).
Additional end study impacts addressed directly to the European Commission:
Assessment of the legislative and Regulations, Codes, and Standards (RCS) implications of these systems and any issues identified in obtaining consents to operate the system;
Recommendations for policy makers and regulators on measures helping to maximise the value of renewable energy and stimulate the market for renewables-electrolyser systems.
Proposals are expected to bring the technologies from TRL 6/7 to TRL 8 at the end of the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In the drive to improve efficiency and range of EVs, continuous research and innovation is required for the deployment of advanced light materials. In particular, significant yet affordable weight reduction is possible through the application of eco-design principles and the use of appropriate hybrid, multi-material solutions with integrated multiple functionality to guarantee that all other performance (crashworthiness, reliability, durability etc.) are maintained. Importantly for automotive applications, future developments must adopt the circular-economy principle, including innovative options for end-of-life recovery, reuse, recycling and the optimised use of recycled materials and efficient remanufacturing. The challenge is to adopt such an integrated approach in order to reduce environmental impact and increase energy efficiency across the entire vehicle life-cycle from design, through production and use, to recovery.
Scope:
Proposals will have to address at least one of the two following technical areas:
Lightweight materials and design (both bullet points hereunder must be addressed):
- Lightweight materials (both metallic and reinforced plastics) for automotive applications which are economically-viable including multi-material concepts that allow cost-effective material separation, recycling and recovery, taking into account environmental impact through Life Cycle Assessment;
- Manufacturing and assembly methods and tools to guarantee structural integrity, reliability and long service life by design for lightweight materials (e.g. through understanding of failure mechanisms, of impact of ageing phenomena and the effects of manufacturing processes on a microstructure level) including their experimental and model-based characterisation;
Cradle-to-cradle approach both bullet points hereunder must be addressed:
- Methods for the adoption of the circular economy and eco-design approach from the earliest stages of vehicle development, integrating product design and sustainable manufacturing, and including the optimal use of recycled and/or bio-ressourced materials;
- Implementation of advanced methodologies for improved design capabilities via numerical simulation, virtual and physical testing and validation, for the lightweight design of different vehicle types. These methodologies will not cover batteries.
The primary focus of the activities is on light-duty electric vehicles, where weight minimisation and its impact in terms of improving vehicle efficiency and range is top priority; nevertheless proposals can investigate and exploit, where it can be demonstrated to be appropriate, the potential benefits of application to a wide range of road vehicles including heavy-duty.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrated affordable and sustainable vehicle weight reductions of at least 10% with respect to the results already achieved by previous projects in the same area, through the optimised deployment of advanced light materials;
Reduction in vehicle development and hence in the lead times for the market introduction of new, more energy-efficient vehicles, through the use of advanced methodologies and numerical simulation tools;
Widespread deployment of procedures to ensure structural integrity and safety of components made of advanced light materials while promoting their efficient repair and reuse through in-service health-monitoring and inspection;
Effective solutions for reuse, recycling and/or energy recovery of all materials, components and sub-systems in line with forthcoming ELV legislative requirements;

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Waterborne transport moves 90% of global trade and today accounts for 3% of global CO2 emissions (similar to air transport). This proportion is predicted to increase with growing global trade and improvements within other sectors. The International Maritime Organisation has shown that GHG emissions from ships have increased by 70% since 1990 and a European Parliament report predicts that without action the global share of shipping's GHG emissions may reach 17% by 2050.
Waterborne transport (Maritime & Inland) can also be a major contributor to air pollution (PM, NOx, SOx), particularly in coastal regions around port cities and busy waterways. Hull coatings, discharges and noise can also influence the underwater environment.
Inland waterway vessels, whilst also supporting low carbon logistic chains and decongesting European roads are largely powered by older generation diesel engines and improvements are necessary to further reduce GHG emissions and to reduce air pollution in order to meet regulatory and local urban air quality requirements.
There are potential solutions for low - and zero-emission future ships and to improve the environmental performance of the existing fleet (Electrification, fuel cells, renewables, fuels, exhaust treatments, efficiency improvements, optimised logistics etc.).
A structured approach to R&I is needed to achieve wider use of these solutions, for example battery powered shipping needs to be integrated with port and electricity infrastructures, the use of these solutions must be cost-effective, safe and practical. R&I taking place at EU, national and international levels need to be identified and coordinated to maximize value and avoid duplication.
Consequently, a strategic research and innovation agenda and new partnerships are needed towards the supply chain, research community, technology and energy providers. Clear priorities must be established and widely communicated so that they can become a focus for the greening of waterborne transport as a whole.
Scope:
To address these challenges, proposals should cover all the following activities:
Establish a multi stakeholders ""green shipping"" expert group. The group should address both maritime and inland transport with a membership including, for example, representatives from inland waterways, shippers, ship owners, waterborne equipment providers, ship builders, ports, logistics, energy and fuel providers, class societies, civil society and expertise in relevant technologies such as renewables, batteries and fuel cells. The group shall cooperate with the Waterborne Technology Platform, coordinate with Member States and Associated Countries and take into account the activities of the European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF), the European Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) and EU programmes such as the Motorways of the Sea under the Connecting Europe Facility.
Working with the ""green shipping"" group, and considering the state-of-the-art, establish a clear vision for green waterborne transport which includes quantified targets for 2025, 2030 and 2050. Targets should include GHG, PMs, SOx, NOx as well as addressing different kinds of use e.g. for inland, deep sea, short sea, offshore and different vessel types such as cruise ship, ferry, small passenger ship etc.
Building on the vision, jointly establish a strategic research and innovation agenda and an implementation plan for green waterborne transport. The most important priorities with the highest impact and the related knowledge gaps should be identified together with any synergies with all relevant programmes and actions at national, international and European level. The outcomes should be attractively presented in a way that is suitable for a general readership and also in a form that is suitable for the waterborne sector.
Identify and if necessary develop the most appropriate mechanisms, incentives and business models to increase the take-up and deployment of the outcomes from the R&I projects.
Establish and implement a strong communication strategy which will ensure visibility within wider society, press, the sector as a whole and with important stakeholders. Publish full reports, clear summary documents, electronic and visual media that are attractive and suitable for a general readership and the waterborne sector. The outcomes and related R&I activates should be disseminated widely, including within an annual workshop or conference which will ensure the widest possible attendance, visibility and engagement.
Whilst work must focus on the greening of shipping towards the zero- emission goal for all waterborne transport, some related activities concerning digitalisation, safety and competitiveness may also be included.
The Commission considers proposals requesting a contribution of up to EUR 1 million would enable this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Improving environmental performance of waterborne transport towards achieving a goal of zero-emission. Achieving decarbonised, low environmental impact logistic chains. Increase Europe's competitive lead in green shipping technology Better targeting of R&I efforts and resources within a coherent strategy. Increased synergies between relevant national, international and European programmes. Increased take-up of R&I outcomes. Create wide spread awareness and ""buy in"" to a European strategy towards zero-emission shipping. Increased visibility for R&I outcomes and recognition that it is essential to improving environmental performance and moving towards the goal of zero-emission shipping.

The objective of this topic is to define R&D roadmaps for a sustainable and efficient road transport system in Europe. It calls for a Coordination and Support Action to support ERTRAC (the European Technology Platform for Road Transport), future Partnerships relevant to road transport in Horizon Europe and the European Commission in defining the research needs for their upcoming research and innovation programmes, and by then helping to achieve the targets set at EU and global level (EU Transport White Paper, COP21 for decarbonisation, etc.).
International cooperation with developing and emerging economies should also be developed in order to increase efficient mobility for all, reduce local (air and noise) and CO2 emissions, and tackle health and safety issues, and increase attractiveness and competitiveness in particular in urban areas.
Scope:
Proposals should take a comprehensive approach ranging from components up to system integration, and include enabling technologies where relevant. Both passenger mobility and freight transport should be addressed and covering urban mobility as well as inter-urban and long-distance transport. They should address all the following aspects:
Updating of research agendas and roadmaps developed by the European Technology Platform ERTRAC (European Road Transport Research Advisory Council) and supporting the definition of research priorities of future Horizon Europe Partnerships relevant to road transport, covering all transport research fields.
Facilitating cooperation between cities in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. Actively support policy and knowledge exchange and establish a peer-to-peer exchange and capacity building programme that takes advantage of the results of a large number of relevant cities. Cooperation between EU and international projects on urban mobility. Develop implementation concepts for sustainable mobility including shared private vehicles (e.g. light-duty vehicles and 2-, and 3-wheelers), logistics (e.g. e-Trucks, cargo bikes), public transport systems (e.g. Bus Rapid Transit Systems, buses, soft modes) and new mobility services.
Liaise with international financing institutions to foster the take-up and implementation of the concepts developed, support the European Commission in international discussions and specialised sectorial Fora related to Mobility for All, Climate Change and the New Urban Agenda. Track global progress on urban electric mobility and support UN activities, such as the Urban Electric Mobility Initiative (UEMI).
The implementation requires close collaboration with the leading European stakeholders in transport research, including vehicles manufacturers, supply industry, and research and engineering organisations, as well as strong links with other relevant European initiatives and associations. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged with key emerging countries, in particular with Asia, Latin America and Africa.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.8 to 1 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
This action will bring together the leading European stakeholders in road transport research to develop roadmaps and support international cooperation. It will contribute to a further harmonisation of research and innovation, and therefore contribute to the European Research Area, in particular also in the view of innovation, as well as to the European strategies for a future transport system.
Proposals are expected to contribute to:
The objective of the European Union for climate action and sustainable development.
The objectives set by the Paris Agreement (COP21) and the New Urban Agenda.
The fulfilment of post 2020 emission targets in road transport (at least 30% by 2030 compared to 2021)
The EU's long-term goal of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries by 2050 (""Vision Zero"")

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Environmental impacts from cars and vans have historically been assessed through standardised testing or drive cycles. However, to assess total environmental impacts, real world behaviours and interactions beyond pure propulsion should be evaluated and optimised. This is particularly relevant for plug-in hybridised systems, where the discontinuous nature of operation and the possibility that users don't charge the battery poses significant problems in both the reduction and the assessment of emissions in real driving conditions. In addition, the possibility of converting engine waste heat to useful power or for vehicle functions such as heating or cooling can deliver improvements in energy efficiency but adds significant complexity to these issues. Innovative energy generators, specifically developed for hybrid applications can provide benefits in terms of energy efficiency, cost, size and weight in comparison with derivatives of existing engines as currently implemented in PHEVs. The challenge will be to optimise in real time which form of energy should be used under a range of specific conditions and what new in-engine or after-treatment approaches can be used to holistically minimise real world emissions of both greenhouse and toxic substances.
Proposed solutions should reach at least TRL7 at the end of the project.
Scope:
Proposals will have to address all the following technical areas:
Advanced energy generators in hybrid electric applications (excluding therefore simple derivatives of existing engines) to minimise total environmental impacts.
Evaluation and optimisation of related hybrid driveline technologies and topologies matching the characteristics of the innovative systems if these are significantly different from current implementations, based on real world operation.
Holistic management and optimisation of thermal functions of vehicles and systems in both battery- and engine-based operation. This includes battery thermal management, passenger comfort and safety functions (like demisting/defrosting) and real-world operation of after-treatment. The latter, for instance, could be achieved by storing and using available heat or electric energy to improve catalysts efficiency by maintaining them close to or above light-off temperature. Heat to power technologies that convert waste heat into electricity or useful work for driveline and ancillary systems can also be researched if a sufficient energy availability and cost-effectiveness can be proven.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Each developed technology should be implemented in an existing demonstrators vehicle (no vehicle or hybrid powertrain development is foreseen except as mentioned above for innovative technologies for which this is impossible) and independently tested in real driving conditions according to the methodologies developed for PHEVs in RDE regulation, with the following more stringent requirements:
15% higher V x apos values in urban, extraurban and motorway real driving segments;
Use of raw emissions with no weighting;
A 2000m limit on altitude gain;
No time limit on 165 km/h maximum test speed.
Engine peak efficiency shall reach at least 47% to guarantee high efficiency also in areas not covered by battery propulsion (particularly in motorway driving).
A battery consistent with a WLTP range of at least 80km shall be incorporated or its mass simulated for RDE testing, which will however be performed in charge sustaining mode, with a full passenger load.
The resulting technology shall demonstrate a reduction of the real world environmental impacts of vehicles consistent with the level of ambition defined for the European Commission Horizon Prize for cleanest engine of the future[1] (with a minimum score of 3[2] for each main pollutant PM/PN, NOx and hydrocarbons, and 1 for “other pollutants” i.e. ammonia, formaldehyde, nitrous oxides and carbon oxide) thus simulating compliance with possible future regulation and ensuring a low impact also when running on the combustion engine.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
By 2050, 67% of the population is expected to live in urban areas[1]. As cities become bigger and smarter, this trend leads to new opportunities for specialised vehicle designs, more specific to urban users’ including commuter’s needs and operations and last mile delivery. New vehicle architectures should lead to flexibility and modularity in order to ensure urban-readiness (appropriate range, compatibility with charging infrastructures, ease of parking and operations) in all kind of urban and sub-urban areas, most likely with different implementation levels of infrastructure and smart technologies. Additionally, it is assumed that these vehicles do not need to be designed for high-speed operation and long range, and can be easily charged sufficiently fast and comfortably to meet the daily needs of urban and suburban mobility usage scenarios, which may also include sharing concepts. Consideration can be also given to usability by elderly and disabled persons.
The targeted vehicles will cover small and light vehicles following the design principle of right-sizing vehicles for their mission. These will all satisfy performance targets such as improved efficiency during urban usage or control strategies based on data from traffic flow monitoring or prediction systems, as well as integration into the sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) of the respective urban areas, with more effective use of parking spaces and possible decreased urban congestion, including demands arising for mobility and logistics across functional urban boundaries, e. g. urban to suburban.
Scope:
Proposals should address only one of the following subtopics (except in the case of modular concepts capable of addressing subtopics 2 and 3 respectively with the same platform
Urban light personal mobility - The success of vehicles such as monowheels, electric scooters and hoverboards suggests to explore innovative microvehicle designs suitable for urban/sub-urban dweller and commuter’ needs with the option for usage within shared mobility schemes.These vehicles will be aimed at improving specific urban usage needs such as decreased congestion, elimination of parking and recharging need in case weight and volume are low enough to allow the user to carry them at all times. Such microvehicles would also have the capability of interfacing with urban collective transport systems (i.e. easy access to buses, trams and trains for “last mile” transfers to achieve full intermodality). Concepts to improve safety of users and of pedestrians (if these vehicles were used on sidewalks) are an added bonus. The proposals should develop a solution up to TRL 8-9 and must include a detailed exploitation strategy and a draft business plan for the product to be developed. The proposers should demonstrate their capacity to have a market ready product by the end of the project. Regulatory aspects shall also be covered, in particular about the integration of these new concepts in road codes.
Light and flexible multipassenger vehicles (e.g. collective or individual, owned or shared up to M1 category) with high safety for passengers and vulnerable road users and specific features to facilitate shared use such as autonomous-capable vehicles with automated relocation to charging points or areas with insufficient vehicle density. An added dimension of flexibility and modularity (e.g. including reconfigurable interiors) can also be considered to support the ability to adapt and upgrade in order to move from one application to the next, and cater, if relevant, to the needs of different users and uses as required for shared mobility scenarios). Gender aspects should be considered in the design of the vehicles, when relevant, for instance in the case of crashworthiness.
Rightsized vehicles for commercial uses (up to N1 category) such as last-/first-mile delivery, construction and maintenance support (masons, plumbers, HVAC technicians etc.), that are suitable specifically for urban scenarios. Affordability will be aimed at achieving an acceptable acquisition cost and significantly lower operational expenditure while specific tailoring to particular urban usage needs will aim at ensuring high transportation and charging efficiency and optimised land use (e.g. “right-power” DC-charging at pre-defined locations - home base, customer/delivery points etc. - might be sufficient).
For all these subtopics, fully integrated safety should be considered as a priority, including crash resistance (in case of three and four wheels urban vehicles) providing equivalent occupant safety and vulnerable road user protection as the M1/N1 vehicle they would replace; in the case of micro vehicles, safety innovation should be targeted at reducing their vulnerability in traffic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million for sub-topic 1 and of between EUR 4 and 6 million for sub-topic 2 and 3 would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
For completely new microvehicle concepts and configurations (subtopic 1), proposers should demonstrate benefits on a mission/range basis in comparison to current types (monowheels, hoverboard, e-bikes or electric scooters) as appropriate in the foreseen applications.
Next generation vehicles concepts in sub-topics 2) and 3) shall demonstrate in real testing ambitious targets of up to 10% energy efficiency improvement in comparison with existing electric vehicles of the same class.
Price will be on a par with current vehicles used for similar missions (minicars, vans of similar payload to be used as benchmarks for subtopic 2 and 3, while current hoverboards and scooters are the benchmark for subtopic1).
These vehicles will inherently benefit local air quality and promise rapid implementation due to their holistic and design-for-purpose approach.
The perception of low safety of the smaller categories of vehicles should be dispelled by proving their resistance in crash (on real vehicles, achieving EURONCAP 4 star car crash standards for subtopics 2 and 3). Lower probability of having an accident is a desired but not mandatory outcome for subtopic 1.
Increased acceptance of single purpose design vehicles is expected due to physical demonstration of the feasibility (both technical and economical) of equivalent or superior performance, upgradeability and operational safety in relevant environment particularly for light and flexible transport.

In 2018 historic targets were agreed within International Maritime Organization (IMO) to cut the total net global GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, to reduce carbon intensity by at least 40% by 2030 compared to a 2008 benchmark and to completely decarbonise shipping by the end of the century.
Presently shipping accounts for around 2.5% of global GHG emissions and although ships are becoming more efficient, due to increasing global trade this contribution is increasing. These emissions are more than any EU state and if the sector was a country, it would rank as the sixth highest in the world. In 2015, shipping accounted for 13% of overall EU greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector[1]. Overwhelmingly, long distance shipping accounts for the majority of GHG emissions and its decarbonisation is particularly challenging. It is expected that solutions will need to combine a variety of technologies, operational practices, energy sources and efficiency measures. Furthermore, it will be essential to link any measures to robust data and measurements to better quantify their effectiveness and optimisations.
Scope:
All following aspects should be addressed:
Working together with, for example operators, ship builders, marine equipment manufacturers, fuel and energy suppliers and others research will address the development of technologies combined with operational practices to substantially reduce GHG emissions from long distance shipping in line with the IMO target and without increasing other forms of pollution.
Excluding fuel development, a wide range of potential solutions can be proposed including the use of wind and solar assistance combined with efficiency improvements and other alternate energies. Solutions can be proposed in combination and should take into account the likely availability of infrastructure (including bunkering) on long distance routes.
Solutions should also take into account the CO2 equivalent from any reduction of black carbon emissions.
Costs, GHG reductions and any other potential waste streams shall be convincingly analysed using real data and testing programmes in addition to theoretical analysis.
Implications for the provision of new infrastructures shall be quantified and assessed.
To at least TRL5, technologies, systems and practices shall be tested at full scale on operational shipping. The differences between predicted and measured data should be identified.
Any reduction in GHG emissions that are founded upon innovative operational practices must be robustly benchmarked against the current state of the art, for example concerning ship routings and speeds through the use of “big” AIS “data“ and/or other satellite data.
A robust communication strategy should be developed and implemented so as to ensure wider public engagement as well as a strong engagement with the global shipping sector and its customers.
Cooperation with IMO and EU activities and fora concerning the decarbonisation of shipping is encouraged. Build upon and cooperate with any related activities and research.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 10 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
Development of innovative solutions to decarbonise shipping that exceed the IMO’s 2050 target to decarbonise by 50% and which are applicable to ship types that are the largest emitters of GHGs such as: bulk carriers, tankers, container ships, cruise ships and passenger liners. Establishment of robust benchmarks and methods which will provide wide confidence of the “real world” impacts from any specific GHG reduction measure including potential scalability and any secondary environmental impacts. Improve the competitiveness of European maritime industries and shipping companies within the field of green shipping. Increase the awareness and take up by end users. Provide evidence to policy makers within EU and globally concerning infrastructure requirements necessary to meet the 2050 decarbonisations target.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
This action is part of the Aviation International Cooperation Flagship called ""Safer and Greener Aviation in a Smaller World"" mentioned in the introduction to this work programme 2018-2020.
Accelerated public and privately-funded development and demonstration efforts in the US, over the last years, aim towards the introduction of new commercial supersonic aircraft as early as 2020-2022. In parallel, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to take a leadership role in creating federal and international policies, regulations, and standards to certify safe and efficient civil supersonic aircraft operations. Other countries such as Japan and Russia are also investing in research on commercial supersonic aircraft.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly Resolution A39-1 instructs the Council to review its Annexes so as to ensure that they take due account of the problems that the operation of supersonic aircraft may create for the public. In response to this Resolution, the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) is in the process of developing environmental standards and recommended practices (SARPs) under Annex 16. In October 2018 Austria on behalf of the European Union, of all EU Member States, of other Member States of the European Civil Aviation Conference and of Eurocontrol, submitted a working paper at ICAO (AN-Conf/13-WP/211)[1]. This European working paper presents the European views on the subject and urges a holistic environmental approach (noise and emissions) before considering the introduction of supersonic aircraft into the global air navigation system.
In response to this European working paper, the challenge for the EU is to act promptly and shape together with the International community high environmental standards in line with ICAO Assembly Resolution A39-1. Research is needed for better understanding the combined and interdependent environmental impacts of potential supersonic aviation on citizens, as well as on the European and international regulatory and certification processes.
The EU should remain a decisive player for thorough development of ICAO noise and emissions standards setting (CO2 and air pollutants). This topic supports this objective by developing expertise at European and international level.
Leveraging resources with international partners can help, on the one hand, in shaping the new global regulations in line with EU’s climate change Long Term Strategy, and on the other hand, in sharing costs, risks and benefits, as well as in ensuring a level playing field.
Scope:
Proposals should timely assess the holistic environmental impact of potential supersonic aviation and provide evidence for public acceptance long with suitable international high environmental standards. Proposals should take into consideration the results achieved within the EU projects FP6 HISAC[2] (Environmentally friendly high-speed aircraft) and Horizon 2020 RUMBLE[3] (Regulation and norm for low sonic boom levels). Proposals should also include the latest technological developments and explore potential solutions beyond the state-of-the-art, contributing to two or more of the following areas:
Advance further high-fidelity environmental modelling integrated into multi-disciplinary optimization of supersonic aircraft, trajectories and operations.
Assess and explore physics-based pathways to decrease noise and emissions at airport/local and global level (i.e. CO2, NOx, water vapour as well as their impact to ozone concentration in the stratosphere). Assess their impacts to trajectory optimization and aeropropulsion technologies to further reduce sonic-boom level and emissions.
Quantify the efficiency of sonic boom shaping in terms of various boom effects, and not only in terms of noise (e.g. sleep disturbance).
Explore further the characterisation of indoor boom annoyance (relevant metrics, measurements devices and locations), in collaboration with EASA and other national and international agencies.
Quantify sonic boom variability due to meteorology, turbulence, urban environment and buildings and address the development of certification processes that take into consideration the stochastic nature of sonic boom.
Develop at European or International level, accepted and validated modelling tools that capture the physics of the generation and propagation of sonic booms, towards further contributing at ICAO level, according to the CAEP work programme and agenda.
The proposals may include the commitment from the European Aviation Safety Agency and European national civil aviation authorities to assist or to participate in the actions. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries such as the Russian Federation, United States of America, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Australia and South Africa. International cooperation can include work towards the development of enabling technologies, joint tests, standards and certification, taking into account bodies such as United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
Where applicable, proposals are encouraged to join international demonstration campaigns for noise and emissions assessments at all phases, including take-off and landing, provided that meaningful outcomes can be delivered according to CAEP work programme and agenda.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower or higher amounts.
Expected Impact:
Maintain high level of environmental protection, especially in terms of global and local emissions and noise.
Ensure suitable global regulations, standards, operational procedures and recommended practices for the protection of the citizens and of the environment.
Contribute to maintain world-class knowledge and skills in Europe in the field of civil supersonic aviation.
Contribute to stimulate disruptive innovation in civil aviation with spin-offs into other civil aerospace segments and other civil sectors.
Contribute to inspire and engage new generations of students and engineers.

","08 September 2020","Specific Challenge:
Growing road traffic in Europe results in detrimental effects on the environment and public health in spite of the gradual emissions reduction due to increasingly stringent emission standards. Some technologies lead to particles of smaller and smaller size that influence the health of citizens living close to traffic, before aging in the atmosphere and contributing to background pollution. Secondary particles from gaseous and volatile engine exhaust components are also coming into focus as a significant health-affecting contribution. Moreover, the effects of some specific emissions (e.g. particles from tyres or natural gas engines) are either not sufficiently understood or remain undetected by current air quality or certification procedures. Finally noise (again in particular from tyres), remains an issue for larger road vehicles, since it would remain so even in the case they were progressively electrified.
Scope:
Proposals can focus on one or both of the following subtopics, but must be ready to work in cooperation and share results with other selected or running proposals particularly as far as data and material for experimentation (particle samples for health testing, for instance) are concerned:
1) Transport nanoparticles
All bullet points within this subtopic must be addressed:
Assessing and understanding the biological processes leading to negative effects on human beings and animals (including sex and gender differences, when relevant) in particular impacts of nanoparticles below 100 nm on carcinogenesis in multiple organs including both inflammation effects and the ""Trojan Horse"" effect of the different chemicals constituting or absorbed on the particles, as well as combined effects of the various components of exhaust gases. Work should consider both aged and fresh aerosols, include primary and secondary volatile and not volatile particles, in particular considering the significant emerging component of extremely fine nanoparticles (below 23 and even 10 nm) constituting a large share of exhausts from certain types of engines like gasoline and natural gas ones.
Assessing if and what variability of these effects exists with size, chemical composition and morphology, linking as far as possible the impacts with specific emission sources and leading to an understanding and quantification of the risks posed by different types and sources of particles. This research should cover all types of transport-related particles sources (both exhaust and non-exhaust, from road, rail, aviation and shipping) taking into account results from previously funded research projects in the same areas.
Evaluating the possible future impact of new policies in this area on public health and well-being of citizens and acceptance of the negative economic impacts that could derive from them.
2) Reduction of noise and particles emissions from tyres
All bullet points within this subtopic must be addressed:
Assessment and characterisation (respectively for at least one representative car and truck tyre size), of the amounts of tyre particles emitted in different driving conditions (acceleration, braking, different constant speeds, corner driving) both in laboratory and on real roads with on-boards system, by implementing sensors and analysing nanoparticles characteristics (size, distribution, chemical composition) determining in particular the number and mass shares of particles contributing to PM10, PM2.5 and PM0.1. The effects of chemical transformations of these particles in the air, if any relevant ones are possible, should be assessed to verify if any other negative health effect can be defined and quantified.
Evaluation of traffic noise effect on the cardiovascular system, assessing which type of noise (impulsive or background) has the most consequence on health taking into account sex and gender differences when relevant, in order to influence the development methodologies for limiting noise, and to anticipate future legislation and emerging issues.
Develop innovative tyres of heavy-duty freight transport optimised for low noise, rolling resistance, wear and therefore particles emissions, particularly in cruise conditions, while keeping a sufficient level of all other relevant performance parameters (traction, skid resistance, etc.). Due consideration should be taken of all road surface types in Europe present on extra-urban roads, and potential for co-optimisation should be considered if this can deliver global benefits without compromising the specific design features of tyres and road surfaces in the different environments for which they have been developed and for other types of vehicles (i.e. an improvement of road surface for trucks should not lead to worsening performances for other vehicles).
From the above experience, development of reliable and repeatable methodologies for the assessment and comparison of tyre emissions and tread wear for potential future legislation.
Particles tracing and quantification of the contribution of tyre wear to the microplastics issue in water bodies (rivers, lakes, seas..) and in the ground.
Evaluating the possible future impact of new policies in this area on public health and well-being of citizens and public acceptance of the negative economic impacts that could derive from them.
Proposals in all areas could foresee international cooperation and experience and exploit synergies in view of establishing future international standards and regulations, including contributing to risk governance in the emerging field of nanomaterials (from which some input from relevant research projects could be gained as well).
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
Expected Impact:
The project resulting from these areas shall deliver the following impacts:
Enhanced understanding of the health threats posed by particles and noise.
Guidance for developing and prioritising mitigation measures in future legislation on air quality and emissions, taking into account social aspects.
European and possibly global standards in critical industrial areas like engines and wear components (brakes, clutches and tyres).
At least 6dB(A) truck tyre noise reduction in areas which will not benefit from zero emissions vehicles low powertrain noise, i.e. along motorways and urban/periurban thoroughfares at speeds between 50 and 90 kph, where truck tire noise is very relevant.

","16 July 2019
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
While significant progress has been made, energy efficiency in the Europe is a battle that remains to be won. Buildings, as they represent the biggest energy consumer in the Europe, have a prominent role to play. New buildings consume today much less than they used to. This is due to ambitious policies: the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) has set a demanding framework for energy performance of buildings, which has fostered a rapid evolution of technologies and practices towards greater levels of energy efficiency. This also applies to systems and products that are used in buildings, such as lighting, space and water heaters, domestic appliances and ICT equipment; EU-Regulations on energy-related products under the Ecodesign and Energy Labelling policies are estimated to deliver energy savings of around 175 Mtoe per year in primary energy by 2020, more than the annual primary energy consumption of Italy. Improving skills of installers and service providers can deliver further savings.
Energy performance of buildings generally does not reflect consumption from appliances that are not part of technical building systems, such as heating, ventilation and cooling systems. At a time when the designed energy performance of buildings and appliances is improving dramatically, it would be worth gaining an accurate vision and understanding of their actual, real-life energy performance. Access to information on the actual energy performance and energy consumption is essential to help users making informed choices, both in terms of investment and in terms of usage and maintenance. In this respect, a remaining challenge is to advance the way actual energy performance and consumption is assessed and measured. For buildings, the energy performance is mainly calculated at design stage, based on the characteristics of the buildings’ envelope, components and systems. Real consumption can be taken into account but to a certain degree that remains limited. For appliances, energy consumption is tested and monitored as they are placed on the market or put into service under conditions that aim to reflect real life usage. This approach is reliable but still, in-use performance may vary e.g. depending on the way buildings and products are commissioned, installed, set up and utilised, accordingly. For certain products, a specific challenge comes with the software or firmware updates of - usually connected - devices, which often change the original settings with considerable impact on the energy consumption (e.g. disabling of standby-modes). In addition, performance may evolve, i.e. decrease, over the lifetime, which is not reflected by the performance as designed or placed on the market. Addressing therefore the self-assessment of products actual energy performance to achieve or maintain better energy efficiency at appliance level and by extension a better energy management in the building is important.
Scope:
Proposals should develop and demonstrate cost-effective technological solutions for the self-assessment of actual energy performance of buildings and the products which use energy in buildings. Such solutions would rely on collection of real-time data from the products installed and used in the building (within a system or stand-alone) and aggregation of this data at the building level. The aim is to follow, over time, and with the best possible granularity, the actual consumption and the evolution of energy performance of the building, individual systems and individual appliances (including those that are integrated within systems).
The solution should ensure, to a certain extent, the energy-optimisation functions executed at building, system or appliances level based on the real time and historical data of energy consumption, which can be crossed with other data as appropriate.
Proposals should demonstrate how, thanks to existing smart capabilities of appliances, systems and sensors, it would be possible for a building to self-assess its energy performance, address, to a certain extent, its underperformance (lower than the average or lower than as designed energy performance) and provide information on the level of performance and related evolution – at building-level (aggregated view), but also at system / appliance level (disaggregated view).
In the calculation of energy performance, at building and product level, proposals should ensure full knowledge of and compliance with the requirements from the EPBD (Annex I on the calculation of energy performance), related CEN standards, with energy consumption measurement approaches and related processes involving smart functionalities (Ecodesign preparatory studies on smart appliances and on Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS)). They should also take into account the technological and regulatory state-of-the-art for (smart) metering and billing. For products regulated under Ecodesign and Energy Labelling, the measured and reported energy consumption should be benchmarked against the provisions of the relevant regulations and used to create a basis for future provisions. Information additional to energy consumption where applicable (i.e. load, programme) should be recorded in order to look into providing input on usage patterns and energy savings potential at appliance level. In this respect, proposals could include activities (e.g. training) aiming at improving skills of installers and service providers, when putting products and systems into service.
Proposals should make the best use of available interoperability solutions and should seek to support the promotion of European standards and other relevant European initiatives relevant for smart buildings, smart homes and smart services (semantics, e.g. SAREF, data models, data layers, protocols, software building blocks, APIs, middleware, solutions for smart services, standards, relevant industrial consortia or technology initiatives, etc.).
Proposals should demonstrate that the solution proposed would be applicable, based on available technology, across the European building stock and products groups available on the single market and, to this end will include a set of pilots where the solution will be deployed, tested, and related impacts assessed. Pilots should involve several types of products and technical building systems with longer lifecycles (e.g. boilers and water heaters, radiators, ventilation, lighting and BACS controlling one or more of these functions etc.) and with shorter ones (domestic appliances, ICT equipment, multimedia and consumer electronics etc.), testing several types of operating modes and user settings. Recharging points for electric vehicles and other forms of energy storage should also be incorporated in the pilots. Pilots should demonstrate self-assessment and self-reporting of energy consumption at appliancelevel.
The proposed solutions should not adversely affect the original functionalities, product quality, lifetime, as well as warranties of the appliances. They should be cost-effective, user-friendly and not require significant development, installation or maintenance work.
Besides the pilot demonstrations, proposals are expected to include clear business model development and a clear path to finance and deployment of the proposed solution. These business models and exploitation strategies should target the broad uptake of such solutions across the Europe and clarify how, these solutions could possibly support the development of related energy service businesses, in particular ESCO’s.
As part of exploitation activities, proposals should also investigate how such self-assessment solutions could support a forward-looking evolution of energy performance assessment practices, both for buildings (in relation to the EPBD and therein, in particular in relation to Energy Performance Certificates) and for energy-related products (in relation to testing products energy performance under Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Regulations).
Projects are required to follow the H2020 guidance on ethics and data protection[1], taking into account digital security, privacy and data protection requirements including the compliance with relevant directives/regulations (e.g. NIS[2] , eIDAS[3], GDPR[4] ) and relevant National Legislation.
In addition, consortia should clarify how the proposed solution could support a cost-effective, performance- and data- based assessment of the smart readiness of a building (i.e. the calculation of the 'smart readiness indicator', within the meaning of the EPBD). In relation to this, proposals will also investigate how the solution proposed could lead to the self-assessment of buildings’ smart readiness capabilities beyond solely energy performance, in particular the capability of a building and its appliances to ensure the satisfaction of building users’ needs and the capability of a building to adapt operations based on signals from its environment, in particular the grid (i.e. energy flexibility).
The proposals should involve appliance suppliers (e.g. heating, cooling, domestic appliances, and ICT equipment), installers and building energy management solution suppliers. Partners from the energy sectors, which can have an interest in the accurate assessment of energy performance and consumption, can also be relevant (e.g. aggregators and/or suppliers and/or ESCO's).
The activities are expected to be implemented at TRL 6-8 (please see part G of the General Annexes).
The Commission considers the proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between 3 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
This topic contributes to the roadmap of the Energy-efficient Buildings (EeB) PPP.

Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary Energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy efficiency is not yet considered as an attractive investment by the financial sector which limits the possibility to use external private finance on top of equity of project owners and available public funding. The lack of statistical data on the actual energy and costs savings achieved by energy efficiency investment projects, as well as on payment default rates, results in financial institutions attributing high risk premiums to energy efficiency investments.
Energy efficiency represents high transaction costs for rather small investments, which is not financially very attractive. Technical and legal standardisation is highly needed at all steps of the investment value chain in order to simplify transactions and increase the confidence of financial institutions. The lack of standardisation of projects also prevents securitisation of energy efficiency assets (loans or equity) so that financial institutions are not able to refinance their debt on the capital markets[1].
Whereas energy efficiency investments are usually expected to be paid back exclusively through the reduction of the energy bill, there is increasing evidence that non-energy benefits play a key role in the decision to invest in energy efficiency. This includes for instance increased building value, lower tenant turnover or vacancy rates etc. These benefits need to be quantified through data collection and monetised in order to evolve the parameters used by financiers to assess an energy efficiency investment.
Moreover, there is a need to set up innovative financing schemes at regional or national level in order to create the conditions for adequate supply of private finance for energy efficiency investments. Innovative financing schemes for energy efficiency aim to progressively maximise the leverage ratio of public funds to private finance. This is in line with the Smart Finance for Smart Buildings initiative that aims at using public funds more effectively.
Access to private finance for energy efficiency and integrated renewables remains challenging. One obstacle is the lack of common understanding of the topic between government, public sector, private sector, and the financial sector. The Smart Finance for Smart Buildings initiative[2] has proposed a comprehensive approach based on the more effective use of public funds, aggregation and project development assistance, and de-risking. However, this approach still needs to be rolled out and shared with all stakeholders at the national level. The Commission is piloting this through the Sustainable Energy Investment Forums initiative since 2016.
Scope:
a) Mainstreaming energy efficiency finance
Proposals should address at least one of the following issues:
Development, demonstration and promotion of frameworks for the standardisation, aggregation and benchmarking of sustainable energy investments. This could include for example, but not exclusively, labelling schemes, project rating methodologies and risk assessment tools, standardised legal and financial structures of assets (loans, guarantees, energy performance contracts etc.) in order to develop securitisation for energy efficiency based financial products. Proposals integrated in a broader approach such as socially responsible investment should focus on the energy component;
Capacity building for banks and investors at the national and local level, in particular on underwriting sustainable energy investments;
Gathering, processing and disclosing large-scale data on actual financial performance of energy efficiency investments, in order to create a track record for energy efficiency in different sectors (buildings, industry, transport, etc.). Proposals should build upon or complement the work of the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG) e.g. the De-risking Energy Efficiency Platform[3] and the Commission’s Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth (COM (2018) 097 final)[4] and its follow-up initiatives.
Further integration of non-energy benefits in project valuation, in particular in the building sector, leading to evolution of existing financial products or creation of new targeted products;
Targeting institutional investors (e.g. public pension schemes) in order to increase the share of their funds invested in energy efficiency, or to develop specific funds or investment products. Supporting the integration of energy efficiency in portfolio management strategies for institutional investors and/or fund managers, including through re-definition of fiduciary duties;
Exploring the impact of revised risk ratings and requirements for energy efficiency on financial regulations (Basel III, Solvency II).
b) Innovative financing schemes for energy efficiency investments
Proposals should address the development or replication and implementation of innovative financing schemes for energy efficiency investments. They can involve different types of organisations, ownership structures and financing models. These schemes should address the provision of finance as well as the structuring of demand, in particular at regional/national level, and target specific areas (e.g. energy-intensive industries, buildings etc.).
In this context, proposals should address one or more of the following points:
Establishment of new innovative, operational financing schemes;
Replication of previously successful solutions e.g. developed and implemented under various project development assistance (PDA) facilities under the Horizon 2020 and Intelligent Energy Europe programmes (including MLEI PDA or ELENA);
Establishment of regional/national aggregators which are able to develop large (standardized) project pipelines;
Overall, proposals should justify how the proposed financing schemes complement already available funding and how they are tailored and innovative for the targeted regions and market segments; as well as clearly demonstrate the market potential, as well as business case and financial viability of the scheme (including investment sizes targeted, expected savings, transaction and management costs, expected returns etc.). In any case, proposals should include a clear action plan to communicate across Europe towards potential replicators.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
a) Mainstreaming energy efficiency finance

Access to private finance for energy efficiency and integrated renewables remains challenging. One obstacle is the lack of common understanding of the topic between government, public sector, private sector, and the financial sector. The Smart Finance for Smart Buildings initiative[1] has proposed a comprehensive approach based on the more effective use of public funds, aggregation and project development assistance, and de-risking. However, this approach still needs to be rolled out and shared with all stakeholders at the national level. The Commission is piloting this through the Sustainable Energy Investment Forums initiative since 2016.
Scope:
Proposals should set up national roundtables focused on energy efficiency investment, as permanent multilateral discussion forums gathering the relevant stakeholders, including but not limited to government, local and regional authorities, financial sector, ESCOs, homeowners, industry sector, construction sector and SME sector. The focus of the roundtables should include existing private and public buildings, industry and SME’s; it could also include the renovation of street lighting, district heating and transport infrastructures. Integrated renewable energy sources can be part of the focus when combined with energy efficiency measures.
The roundtables should (among others) analyse the possibility to upscale existing best practices from the national and European level, develop strategies, roadmaps and action plans, propose improvements in the national policy frameworks and measures, and follow their implementation, develop jointly template documents and contracts leading to a better functioning of the market. The roundtables should act as a forum where all stakeholders can learn from successful market initiatives, and can provide input into the policy making process.
Proposals should build on the activities of the Sustainable Energy Investment Forums initiative[2]. Proposals involving only one country are eligible; however, they should include a small share of activities to exchange with similar roundtables across Europe; those exchanges will be coordinated by the Commission services.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 million and EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Establishment of national energy efficiency investment roundtables;
Number of national / regional policy documents resulting from the roundtables;
Number of key stakeholders involved in the roundtables, in particular from the financial sector;

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Investors and lenders need to gain more confidence on investment projects related to energy efficiency which are still seen as risky and fragmented. European added value can be realised in particular where projects introduce innovation to the market regarding project aggregation and financing solutions minimising transaction costs and engaging the private finance community. European added value could also be realised where projects demonstrably remove legal, administrative and other market barriers for mainstreaming large scale sustainable energy investment schemes.
Scope:
Project Development Assistance (PDA) will be provided to public and private project promoters such as public authorities or their groupings, public/private infrastructure operators and bodies, energy service companies, retail chains, large property owners and services/industry. The action will support building technical, economic and legal expertise needed for project development and leading to the launch of concrete investments, which are the final aim and deliverable of the project.
Proposals should focus on one or more of the following sectors:
existing public and private buildings including social housing, with the aim to significantly decrease energy consumption in heating/cooling and electricity;
energy efficiency of industry and service;
urban transport and mobility such as the use and integration of innovative solutions for alternative fuels in urban mobility and more energy-efficient urban transport and mobility measures including public transport fleet, passenger and freight logistics; and
energy efficiency in existing infrastructures such as street lighting, district heating/cooling and water/wastewater services.
The proposed investments will have to be launched before the end of the action which means that projects should result in signed contracts for sustainable energy investments to that effect, e.g. construction works, energy performance contracts, turnkey contracts.
Whilst proposals may address investments into distributed, small-scale renewable energy sources in combination with energy efficiency, the main focus should lie on capturing untapped high energy efficiency potentials.
Proposals should include the following features:
an exemplary/showcase dimension in their ambition to reduce energy consumption and/or in the size of the expected investments;
deliver organisational innovation in the financial engineering (e.g. on-bill financing schemes, guarantee funds, or factoring funds) and/or in the mobilisation of the investment programme (e.g. bundling, pooling or stakeholder engagement);
demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results towards potential replicators across the Europe;
build on the experiences from previous PDA projects[1].
This PDA facility focuses on small and medium-sized energy investments of at least EUR 7.5 million to EUR 50 million. Large scale investments are covered by the ELENA facility.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Delivery of a series of sustainable energy investment projects and innovative financing solutions and/or schemes;
Every million Euro of Horizon 2020 support should trigger investments in sustainable energy worth at least EUR 15 million;
Primary energy savings, renewable energy production and investments in sustainable energy triggered in the territory of participating parties by the project (respectively in GWh/year and in million Euro of investments);
Demonstration of innovative and replicable investment financing solutions, documenting feedback/uptake from potential replicators.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Energy and fuels represent an important part of the production costs in several Resource and Energy Intensive Industries (REII). While a lot of technical progress has already been done in REII to reduce the energy consumption of the main industrial processes, significant parts of the input-energy are still lost in the form of waste heat/cold by gas, liquid or solid streams. Wide-scale deployment of industrial waste heat/cold recovery is hindered, among others, by the lack of financial/ economic justification for the required equipment and, at times, by the limited industrial applicability (i.e. process re-integration). Often, it is forgotten that directly or after an intermediate transformation step, the sources of heat/cold losses of a given industry can be a valuable resource for other industries and buildings/ District Heating and Cooling operators and that they could be of commercial interest for the waste heat/cold producer. Furthermore, other energy cooperation activities between industries can also contribute to increase their energy efficiency. Thus physical clustering (e.g., of buildings and processes, energy exchange, collective production) and/ or service clustering (e.g., joint contracting) can deliver a more stable cumulative demand, economy of scale for larger installations with higher efficiencies and smaller spatial footprint and an optimised demand response.
Scope:
2018 (Innovation action):
Cost-benefit models for industrial waste heat/cold recovery:
Proposals should develop integrated cost-benefit simulation tools that, based on the characterization of processes, heat/cold streams and other relevant variables, can determine the best utilisation options of recovered waste heat/cold and/ or surplus renewable energy from industrial and eventual other sources (when available). Proposals should also consider the possibility to contribute to efficient use/system integration of renewable energy sources through e.g. heat/cold storage and flexible production.
The proposals are expected to put forward simulation tools that would allow industrial sites/parks to determine the most financial attractive option for using their recovered waste heat/cold and/or surplus renewable energy. This should be based on, inter-alia, waste heat/cold recovery (and storage if necessary) costs (including equipment and process adaptation), retail and/ or whole sale energy prices, (new contracts) administrative and legal costs, (external connecting) infrastructure costs, internal and external demand, waste heat/cold as source of flexibility in electricity system. Other relevant variables should also be included, inter-alia, characterisation of barriers and opportunities on the DHC side (e.g. competition with other heat/cold sources, thermal storage, regulatory conditions). The simulation tools are expected to be flexible enough to allow a large number of different types of industrial sites/ parks to use it, i.e. should allow many energy intensive process characterizations irrespective of the industrial sector and geographic location, and should also take into account supply-demand dynamics.
The simulation tools should be validated through demonstration in real operating conditions in industrial facilities.
Proposals are expected to include clear business model development and a clear path to finance and deployment. Key partners should have the capability and interest in making the developed solution a core part of their business/service model to their clients.
Proposals are expected to look at relevant business models for the collaboration outside the plant/industrial park and have strong communication and dissemination components in order to reach many industries, large private facilities and public authorities.
This topic contributes to the roadmap of the Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency (SPIRE) cPPP.
The activities are expected to be implemented in the range of TRL 4-8 (please see part G of the General Annexes).

Symbiosis in industrial parks and clusters- non-technological barriers
Proposals should improve the energy efficiency of industrial parks districts and clusters by unlocking the market potential and supporting the demand and offer of high-quality energy services by addressing at least one of the following points:
The development and testing of instruments facilitating, at customer/ business level, the actual implementation of energy cooperation such as setting up appropriate process and business organisation, operation and plant design, cooperation mechanisms, related contractual and financial arrangements, better planning, good practices. Proposals need to include capacity building activities such as skills development and engagement of senior and executive management (e.g. CEO, CFO, energy managers) of companies from industrial parks and other related stakeholders.
The development and testing of replicable business models and service concepts, at service provider level (i.e. ESCOs or other relevant 3rd party organisations such as DHC operators), for joint energy services such as identification of horizontal energy services attractive for businesses, identification of the most relevant innovative technical solutions, setting up contractual and financial arrangements, best practices, cost-reduction models. Proposals need to include capacity building activities such as sharing skills, know-how and specific expertise of ESCOs or other 3rd party organisations that would boost the market uptake for such joint energy services contracting in industrial parks.
This topic contributes to the roadmap of the Sustainable Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency (SPIRE) cPPP.
Proposals need to also address legal issues in order to adapt regulatory and legal frameworks at local, regional and national level. Issues related to the sustainability of the proposed symbiosis in case one or more of the involved parties are changing activity (including leaving the park) should be taken into account. Proposals are expected to ensure applicability of the solutions to other industrial parks/ business sectors while strong communication and dissemination components will be needed in order to reach many industries, industrial park managers and ESCOs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

They can involve different types of organisations, ownership structures and financing models such as dedicated credit lines; guarantee facilities; factoring/forfaiting schemes; on-bill (e.g. utility-financed) or on-tax financing schemes; citizen financing (e.g. crowd-funding) for energy efficiency; finance models for the deep renovation of buildings, addressing both property and rental markets; finance models for different industry sectors and cross-sectorial initiatives; financing solutions integrating existing market-based instruments relevant for energy efficiency (e.g. carbon finance instruments, including those under the European Emissions Trading System; energy efficiency obligations, including white certificates; etc.); or schemes based on project aggregators or clearing houses at regional or national level, which should support project development and match demand and supply of energy efficiency finance. These schemes should address the provision of finance as well as the structuring of demand, in particular at regional/national level, and target specific areas (e.g. energy-intensive industries, buildings etc.). Proposals should justify how the proposed schemes complement already available funding and how they are tailored and innovative for the targeted regions and market segments; as well as clearly demonstrate the market potential, as well as business case and financial viability of the scheme (including investment sizes targeted, expected savings, transaction and management costs, expected returns etc.).
Proposals should address one or more of the following points:
Establishment of new innovative, operational financing schemes;
Replication of previously successful solutions e.g. developed and implemented under various project development assistance (PDA) facilities under the Horizon 2020 and Intelligent Energy Europe programmes (including MLEI PDA or ELENA);
Establishment of regional/national aggregators which are able to develop large (standardized) project pipelines;
Creation of EU or regional/national energy efficiency investment roundtables/platforms to organise dialogue with and between the relevant stakeholders and (among others) develop roadmaps, propose improvements in the legal frameworks and develop and validate template documents and contracts leading to a better understanding of the market. Proposals should include a clear action plan to communicate across Europe towards potential replicators.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate, depending on the scope addressed, the impacts listed below, using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Primary energy savings triggered by the project (in GWh/year);
Investments in sustainable energy triggered by the project (in million Euro);
Delivery of innovative financing schemes that are operational and ready to finance energy efficiency investments;
Regional/national aggregators with demonstrated/traceable capacity to set up large-scale pipeline of (standardized) sustainable energy investments (in terms of number of and/or amount of investment);
EU or regional/national energy efficiency investment roundtables/platforms providing a comprehensive range of support and/or services to facilitate access to energy efficiency finance.
Additional positive effects can be quantified and reported when relevant and wherever possible:
Reduction of the greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year) and/or air pollutants (in kg/year) triggered by the project.

There is a need to set up innovative financing schemes at regional or national level in order to create the conditions for adequate supply of private finance for energy efficiency investments. Innovative financing schemes for energy efficiency aim to progressively maximise the leverage ratio of public funds to private finance.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Today, a large share of variable generation electricity sources are connected to distribution grids that were originally designed to distribute electricity supplied by large centralised power generation plants through the transmission grid. In view of the expected growth of variable electricity production, and a shift towards more electrified heating, cooling and transport sectors, new approaches have to be found for managing electricity distribution grids in order to ensure affordability of energy, security and stability of supply, while avoiding massive investments in infrastructures. Electricity storage, in particular relying on batteries, power to heat/cold, power to X, vehicle to grid and other storage solutions will play a key role in providing services to the grid and improve and reinforce the networks capacities.
Scope:
Proposals will develop and demonstrate integrated solutions which will allow the distribution grid to function in a secure and stable manner with large shares of variable renewables. A combination of at least two of the following elements will be tested:
Flexibility measures and electricity grid services provided by storage of electricity (including batteries and vehicle to grid technologies), power to-X (in particular power to heat), demand response[1] and variable generation enabling additional decarbonisation;
Smart grids technologies for an optimum observability and tools for higher automation and control of the grid and distributed energy sources, for increased resilience of the electricity grid and for increased system security, including under extreme climate events;
Market mechanisms incentivising flexibility or other market tools should be defined and tested, for mitigating short-term and long-term congestions or other problems in the network (e.g. dynamic network tariffs and solutions to reduce the costs of energy transition, non-frequency ancillary services). Solutions should demonstrate the necessary cooperation with other system operators and particularly TSOs by facilitating the integration of wholesale and retail markets.
Replicability and scalability of solutions is desirable to ensure the maximum impact of the use of the project results.
Proposals should include a task on the analysis of obstacles to innovation under the current context but also under the future market design context and foresee the coordination on policy relevant issues and obstacle to innovation (e.g. regulatory framework, business models, data management, consumer engagement) with similar EU-funded projects through the BRIDGE initiative[2]. An indicative budget share of at least 2% is recommended for the research work associated with these issues and an additional 2% for the coordination effort.
Proposals should build upon the insights and results of projects that have already been selected in this field under H2020 (information can be found on the BRIDGE web site[3]) and demonstrate their innovative character.
Proposals should comply with the requirements stated in the section 'Common requirements' of the introduction to the part on the Smart citizen-centred energy system.
Proposers can apply under the following two sub-topics:
Flexibility and retail market options for the distribution grid
Flexibility and retail market options for the distribution grid: International cooperation with Canada.
In several international contexts such as the Clean Energy Ministerial, the Mission Innovation initiative launched at COP21, the International Energy Agency Implementing Agreement on Smart Grids (ISGAN), bi-lateral discussions between Canada and the EU identified this topic as being of common interest owing to its potential for decarbonisation. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation with Canada is required under this topic. The cooperation must be under the form of a Coordination Agreement between the Horizon-2020-funded project with a project with similar scope and sizeable efforts supported by Canadian funding authorities (see also Eligibility and admissibility conditions).
Proposals must clearly indicate to which sub-topic they apply.
TRL will range typically between 5 and 8 (see part G of the General Annexes). Proposers will indicate the estimated levels of TRL at the beginning and at the end of the project.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 6 to 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Projects are expected to develop and demonstrate solutions which contribute to at least 2 of the following impacts:
Enhance flexibility of distribution grids which are expected to operate in an overall context of 50% electricity production from renewables in 2030 (EU28 average, see[4]);
Contribute to define the conditions of a well-functioning electricity market which creates business case for stakeholders willing to provide such flexibility and allow to sustain the necessary investments (e.g. variable price strategies);
Improve the capability to manage future energy loads including electrical vehicles;
Improve distribution grid operations which guarantee security of supply and the use of flexibility products while integrating large shares of variable renewables avoiding unnecessary investments by solving congestion.
In the case of sub-topic 2) International cooperation with Canada, the expected impacts of the cooperation to be substantiated in the proposal are to deliver mutual benefits and added value (i.e. in addition of the sum of the results of the two projects).
Proposals are invited to identify and substantiate to which of the above impacts they contribute and include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice that could be used to assess the progress during the project life.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The legislative proposals on the energy market that the Commission adopted on 30 November 2016 (the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package) and for which political agreement has been reached last year, in particular the revised Electricity Directive and the revised Electricity Regulation, promotes that network operators procure services (such as balancing, congestion management and ancillary services) from assets connected to the network both at transmission and at distribution level, in a coordinated way[1]. This will enable more efficient and effective network management and optimisation, for the benefit of increased demand response and the ability to integrate increasing shares of renewables. The same pool of resources will be used by Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs): actions by both can mutually affect each other. In cooperation with market participants and national authorities, they have to define the services they want to procure, and have to set up ways to procure them in a coordinated, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.
Scope:
The focus is on one project that demonstrates the setting-up of markets and digital platforms where electricity TSOs and DSOs can procure grid services from suppliers, aggregators and possibly individual consumers. The focus is also on demonstrating how suppliers, aggregators and possibly individual consumers can use large-scale and small-scale assets/devices owned by consumers and connected to the electricity network to deliver such services to TSOs and DSOs, at a large-scale, i.e. at a size that has a systemic relevance for TSO and DSO operations. The aim is to demonstrate how such markets and platforms will increase cost-efficiency in (future) network operations and create consumer benefits by rewarding them for flexibility in energy (production or consumption) or power through the delivery of grid services, and to facilitate the implementation of the demonstrated markets and platforms by other TSOs and DSOs. Therefore, the markets and platforms should enable the integration of relevant digital technologies like Internet-of-Things, Artificial Intelligence, cloud and big data services.
The selected project should build on experience and best-practices from previous and ongoing projects (in particular those supported under the call LC-SC3-ES-5-2018-2020 in 2018), and aim to deliver one set of protocols and standards with respect to platforms for the procurement of grid services. Building on existing projects, the project will define, test and demonstrate in real-life the operation of integrated, system-based and coordinated markets and platforms, that TSOs and DSOs jointly set up with suppliers and aggregators (but that can also be operated by other parties), for (a set of) grid services, in particular balancing, congestion management, ancillary services. The selected project will also define, test and demonstrate how DSOs and TSOs procure and use these services in a coordinated, transparent and non-discriminatory manner for grid management purposes, in a way that:
will contribute to the development of a seamless pan-European electricity market that makes it possible for all market participants (if necessary via intermediaries such as energy suppliers or aggregators) to provide grid services in a market that is transparent and non-discriminatory;
enables TSOs and DSOs to improve predictability and anticipate network problems, through the procurement of services via markets that incentivise connected consumers, buildings, devices (including small-scale generation) to adapt their energy (consumption or production) or power;
facilitates scaling up the platforms and markets to spread its use by making it as easy as possible for suppliers, aggregators or consumers directly to offer grid services based on other or new small-scale and large-scale assets/devices on these markets, if necessary through as easy and automated pre-qualification processes as possible, Facilitating scaling up can also be done through integrating new services into existing platforms and/or links new services to existing markets as much as possible, by taking into account the ability to integrate future network services that support the energy network transition (e.g. those needed in scenarios with large RES penetration) and by being compatible across borders in line with EU rules, including applicable rules on market coupling and balancing;
demonstrates scalability to deal with the increasing amount of data coming from more and more connected assets/devices that can provide grid services and requires near real-time big data processing, by developing and testing the appropriate ICT infrastructure;
allows procurement based on the specific location and grid conditions (if necessary);
The selected project also will:
Define the needs of network operators for system operation, and turn these into services and products, based on interaction with suppliers, aggregators and energy service companies, that test what services can be provided by what assets;
define and test 1) standardised products and key parameters[2] for grid services; 2) the activation process for the use of assets for these services; 3) the settlement process for payment related to these services; 4) simultaneous procurement of these services by a TSO and a DSO from assets in the DSO network that are connected to that TSO’s network;
recommend a limited set of standardised products and key parameters[2] for grid services that as reference for any TSO or DSO in the European electricity market;
Verify the effectiveness of the services and products with respect to the technological capabilities of the assets (e.g. duration, ramp-up/ramp-down, islanding), including to ensure reliability of supply under different network conditions;
Design and develop ICT systems and infrastructure that will facilitate open (non-proprietary) standardised and interoperable multi-party data-sharing and facilitate scaling-up, including across borders (at least in the EU), between all actors that use the markets and platforms for grid services. This shall be based on a description of the technical requirements and the specifications at the level of the interfaces required for the markets and platforms for grid services (e.g. between DSOs and TSOs: TSOs and TSOs; DSOs and DSOs; TSOs and suppliers/aggregators/consumers/prosumers; DSO and suppliers/aggregators/consumers/prosumers) and shall include ways to effectively address cyber-threats.
make use as much as possible existing open reference architectures, such as FIWARE, and ongoing developments, in particular through a close cooperation with the projects selected under the call ‘DT-ICT-11-2019: Big data solutions for energy’;
Aim to deliver one set of protocols and standards with respect to platforms for the procurement of grid services;
Identify the relevant system data that enable market participants to better assess and forecast the need for grid services and publish such data (as much as possible);
Test innovative ways to promote consumer participation, engagement and perception, such as peer-to-peer trading, and innovative ways to secure transactions, such as via distributed ledgers and blockchain;
investigate the possibilities for innovative pricing and compensation (including through local markets) for consumers that own or use the assets that provide the grid services, taking into account tariff and tax systems;
Provide recommendations to TSOs and DSOs for improvement paths in system operation to enable the integration of new services and products in system operation;
Include a credible business plan to ensure that the tested and demonstrated platforms and markets will continue operation (and further will be further replicated/developed by as many other TSOs and DSOs as possible) in real-life after the project ends;
In relation to the organisation, the selected project is expected to:
Make use of financial support to third parties for at least 2.5% of the EU contribution to the project for the incorporation of developers (SMEs and start-ups) of innovative energy services (in particular for household consumers).
Cooperate with projects supported under the topic LC-SC3-EC-3-2018-2020 that approach the challenge more from a consumer’s perspective and work with Digitisation of Energy projects, funded under the following topics:
SC3-ES5-2018, and ensure that selected projects build on the ongoing work of those selected in 2018;
SU-DS04-2018-2020: Cybersecurity in the Electrical Power and Energy System (EPES): an armour against cyber and privacy attacks;
DT-ICT-10-2018: Interoperable and smart homes and grids;
DT-ICT-11-2019: Big data solutions for energy;
as well as with the projects funded under topic LC-SC3-EE-13-2018-2019-2020: Enabling next-generation of smart energy services valorising energy efficiency and flexibility at demand-side as energy resource where innovative consumer energy services will be developed and tested regarding their business viability and consumer acceptance.
For this purpose, proposals must foresee a work package for cooperation with other selected projects and earmark appropriate resources (5-10% of the requested EU contribution) for coordination and communication efforts and research work associated with cross-cutting issues. This collaboration will be formalized in a dedicated work package.
Coordinate their work with NRA's, ENTSO-E, the DSO organisations and other stakeholders and take into account the experience from other projects through cooperation in the BRIDGE initiative[4]. An indicative budget share of at least 2% of the EU contribution is recommended for the cooperation activities under the BRIDGE initiative.
TRL will range between 5 and 8 (see part G of the General Annexes).
Proposals should comply with the requirements stated in the section 'Common requirements' of the introduction to the part on the Smart citizen-centred energy system.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 20 to 22 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Solutions will demonstrate how markets and platforms for grid services will enable cost-efficient model(s) for electricity network management and integrate higher shares of renewables to support the energy transition. Solutions will also demonstrate how markets and platforms for grid services can be implemented at systemic level in real-life and how they can be scaled up and are replicable across the EU energy system. Solutions will also contribute to opening up significant new revenue streams for consumers and (small-scale) producers to provide grid services, and increase the hosting capacity of RES in the electricity system through smart grid management. They will provide the foundations for new network codes, for example on demand-response.

Cooperate with projects supported under the topic LC-SC3-EC-3-2018-2020 that approach the challenge more from a consumer’s perspective and work with Digitisation of Energy projects, funded under the following topics:
SC3-ES5-2018, and ensure that selected projects build on the ongoing work of those selected in 2018;
SU-DS04-2018-2020: Cybersecurity in the Electrical Power and Energy System (EPES): an armour against cyber and privacy attacks;
DT-ICT-10-2018: Interoperable and smart homes and grids;
DT-ICT-11-2019: Big data solutions for energy;
as well as with the projects funded under topic LC-SC3-EE-13-2018-2019-2020: Enabling next-generation of smart energy services valorising energy efficiency and flexibility at demand-side as energy resource where innovative consumer energy services will be developed and tested regarding their business viability and consumer acceptance.
For this purpose, proposals must foresee a work package for cooperation with other selected projects and earmark appropriate resources (5-10% of the requested EU contribution) for coordination and communication efforts and research work associated with cross-cutting issues. This collaboration will be formalized in a dedicated work package.
Coordinate their work with NRA's, ENTSO-E, the DSO organisations and other stakeholders and take into account the experience from other projects through cooperation in the BRIDGE initiative[4]. An indicative budget share of at least 2% of the EU contribution is recommended for the cooperation activities under the BRIDGE initiative.
TRL will range between 5 and 8 (see part G of the General Annexes).
Proposals should comply with the requirements stated in the section 'Common requirements' of the introduction to the part on the Smart citizen-centred energy system.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 20 to 22 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Solutions will demonstrate how markets and platforms for grid services will enable cost-efficient model(s) for electricity network management and integrate higher shares of renewables to support the energy transition. Solutions will also demonstrate how markets and platforms for grid services can be implemented at systemic level in real-life and how they can be scaled up and are replicable across the EU energy system. Solutions will also contribute to opening up significant new revenue streams for consumers and (small-scale) producers to provide grid services, and increase the hosting capacity of RES in the electricity system through smart grid management. They will provide the foundations for new network codes, for example on demand-response.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A number of tools and future technologies need to be developed, matured and tested to cover gaps and/or to prepare the energy system of 2030 and beyond.
Scope:
Proposals must address only one of the 4 following sub-topics whereby not necessarily all points listed in a sub-topic need to be addressed:
Advanced modelling tools for:
the modelling of the future electricity market to study and analyse the impact and the design of electricity pricing structure from the wholesale markets, to real time markets (balancing and congestion management) and retail markets;
modelling and forecasting energy production from variable renewables, associated frequency and voltage controls issues in the electricity grid and benefits associated with the use of storage.
Advanced tools for
the design and planning and operation of electricity grid infrastructure including distribution and transmission level, taking into account environmental concerns, such as air quality, and footprints and the new constraints from variable renewable generation, the place and role of storage and flexibility; the optimisation of the use of existing electricity assets and network capacity;
the development of grid predictive management strategies with uncertainty (forecasting plus stochastic grid management tools), improving the maintenance of electricity assets (distribution and transmission) as well as the associated data management;
Enhanced TSO / DSO collaboration and coordination tools, secure data exchange across networks along whole the value chain, ICT tools for cross-border trading for nearly real-time balancing; definition of minimum set of specifications to allow automated digital cross-border electricity market.
Enabling technologies for reliable and resilient interconnected European electricity grids, making use of the specific features and the strategic role of the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems Galileo and EGNOS.
Technological developments:
Develop a new generation of reliable, robust and cost-effective energy storage technologies, storage management systems, in particular batteries, able to provide high specific energy rates, large number of life cycles, fast response to the electrical network demands and low maintenance;
Power electronics for batteries and software to manage combined or hybridised decentralised energy systems, also combining several energy vectors: a key focus is on significant cost reduction of these key components for homes, districts and larger systems which have the potential to accelerate significantly the energy transition of the electricity network.
International Cooperation with non-EU/Associated country member of Mission Innovation[1] on Mission Innovation Challenge 7 on Affordable Heating and Cooling for Buildings:
Develop compact thermal energy storage for electricity load shifting that will take up electricity from the grid at the peak times, to be used for heating, cooling or hot tap water at later times. Typical required charging power is 3 kW, for periods of up to three hours. Integration into the building heating system and in the smart electricity grid is a key development element together to the storage materials and technologies.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposal must clearly indicate which sub-topic 1, 2, 3 or 4 they are targeting.
Proposals should comply with the requirements stated in the section 'Common requirements' of the introduction to the part on the Smart citizen-centred energy system.
Expected Impact:
Advanced modelling tools are expected to: increase the knowledge on how to design of price structure and magnitude in order to be able to finance e.g. infrastructure and research and innovation; enhance the accuracy of the prediction of electricity production from variable renewables and better qualify and quantity associated issues and remedies
Advanced tools are expected to develop new approaches to electricity grid planning, monitoring and maintenance that are better suited to today's future characteristics of the grid and enable savings on infrastructure costs.
The technological developments are expected to reduce costs of key technology components to allow European Industry to keep and extend its leadership in power electronics for stationary battery systems of all sizes (from home to utility scale) and the integration of battery systems with high shares of renewable electricity and eventually also heating and cooling.
Contribute to the objectives of mission innovation and provide efficient innovative small scale power to heat/cool flexibility measures that can be deployed in a large number of buildings so as to enable the grid to operate with large share of variable renewable energy
Proposals are invited to include ad-hoc indicators to measure the progress against specific objectives of their choice that could be used to assess the progress during the project life.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Beyond direct efficiency gains and cost savings, digitalization holds the potential to catalyse fundamental, system-wide changes in Energy Systems and Networks. As digitalisation advances, a highly and cross-sectoral interconnected system of energy systems and infrastructures can emerge, with increasing opportunities for integration of renewables and efficient energy management. Electricity is likely to be the first energy sector impacted, digitisation enabling stronger connections to the heating and cooling sector, in particular in buildings and the mobility sector.
Digitalisation can also foster enhanced the participation of stakeholders in local, regional and European value chains. Local communities and prosumers may gradually begin to leverage the opportunities for their involvement in energy communities and energy transactions and boost European innovation and businesses.
In order to achieve this, energy stakeholders must work hand in hand with highly innovative newcomers and lateral thinkers that have a “digital mindset” (e.g.: the block chain community) and also integrate the know-how and experience from other sectors. The approach should also engage potential customers such as infrastructure operators, local industries or communities and end-users in value chains from the local and regional up to the European and global levels.
Therefore, support is needed for the development of future digital platforms, applications and business which maximize benefits for European citizens while incentivising a sustainable, secure and resilient energy system where data protection is guaranteed. Coordinated transnational Research, Demonstration and Innovation actions has the potential to make a large impact.
Scope:
Proposals should coordinate national (or regional) energy and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) research, demonstration and innovation programs and pool the necessary financial resources with a view to implementing joint calls for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area.
The scope of activities should include
The establishment of transnational innovation ecosystems for technology, systems and services that support designing, implementing and testing technical and business services for the future energy systems, building on available ICT platforms and tools; these should enable the participation of SME's and start-ups and develop scalable, customizable and replicable solutions applicable from local through interregional and up to global level.
The coordination and linking of living labs[1] that facilitate the development and testing of prototypes, bringing innovative solutions from TRL4 (proof of concept) to TRL7. This shall enable the sharing of development and test facilities, allowing testing with hundreds of nodes representing real life operating conditions including failures, behaviour and misuse of the solution, as well as gaining experiences for the design of new market and business models.
Connect networks of procurers in different countries and regions, which gather potential buyers and users of the solutions at an early stage, in order to help to understand the needs and requirements for more and more software dominated solutions.
Activities to connect start-ups and investors to reflect on market driven applications.
Establish methodologies and transnational process chains in conformance with European standards, such as SGAM/M490 and ISO/TR 28380, to implement and achieve interoperability of electronic data exchanges in heterogeneous energy-related ICT systems.
Coordinate their work with NRA's, ENTSO-E, the DSO organisations and other stakeholders and take into account, build on, and work with Digitisation of Energy projects, funded under the following topics:
LC-SC3-ES-5-2018-2020: TSO – DSO – Consumer: Large-scale demonstrations of innovative grid services through demand response, storage and small-scale (RES) generation
DT-ICT-11-2019: Big data solutions for energy;

LC-SC3-EE-13-2018-2019-2020: Enabling next-generation of smart energy services valorising energy efficiency and flexibility at demand-side as energy resource.
Proposals should make use of state of the art innovation methodology (such as co-creation, design thinking, policy lab) to the community of solution designers to ensure high quality and highly dynamic communication between involved stakeholder groups. Proposals should include the set-up of a knowledge platform and promote transnational mutual learning.
Requirements in terms of funding rates for the ERA-NET Co-fund instrument can be found in the General Annexes of the work programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution in the range of EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Overall, proposals are expected to enhance the collaboration of regional and national ICT and energy programs and their stakeholder communities, to leverage associated research and innovation / development funds and existing tools and outcomes from former European initiatives like e.g. the Internet of Energy projects FINSENY[2] and FINESCE[3] and contribute to the objectives of SET-Plan Action 4 on 'Increasing the resilience and security of the energy system'[4]. Proposals should also contribute to develop need driven implementation environments on regional and local levels.
More specifically, proposals are expected to:
Accelerate the development of transnational innovation ecosystems, promote the engagement of innovative SME's and start-ups in digital energy systems and solutions, contribute to create new business opportunities, growth and jobs in European regions;
Foster the emergence of transnational initiatives and living labs, rationalise the use of test facilities, produce robust approaches to the use of digital systems;
Activate networks of procurers so as to reach the critical mass needed to develop global solutions that can be customised to local / regional needs;
Emulate local innovation forces and close to market thinking of start-ups and investors;
Promote the development of interoperable solutions enabling wider impact and use of applications, systems and services.

","Coordination and support action
","05 September 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Mobilising investment in energy efficiency and renewables is key for Europe's energy transition. In 2017 the European Commission and 14 EU Member States signed a political declaration to launch the new 'Clean Energy for EU Islands' initiative. Its aim is to help islands reduce their dependency on energy imports by making better use of their own renewable energy sources and embracing more modern, socially inclusive and innovative energy systems.
Europe's more than 2200 inhabited islands can be considered living-labs which can deliver a pipeline of energy investment projects across Europe. Energy transitions on islands often benefit from low opportunity costs due to the existing high prices of conventional liquid fuels in contrast to the variety of renewable sources they may have available.
However, despite tremendous potential, too few islands in Europe succeed in developing and scaling up investment packages. A high degree of organisational, technical and financial innovation is needed to reach significant scale. A key gap is the lack of capacity for islands to transform their overall long-term ambitions into a credible set of plan(s) and project outlines, i.e. investment concepts, that serve as the basis for concrete projects. In particular, local initiatives and/or public authorities on islands have limited resources to access the analytic, financial and legal expertise needed to collect additional data and develop an investment programme of scale i.e. pooling projects and/or developing financing strategies which demonstrate sufficient maturity to enable access to different sources of finance often mobilised locally on the island.
In order for islands to be microcosms of economic, social and environmental transformations they may often require assistance in designing coherent set of projects and selecting the most cost-effective option from the life-cycle perspective, aggregating smaller projects into island-size packages and in mobilising the significant amount of finance needed for a full energy transition. This may also include communication and engagement actions among island inhabitants to identify acceptable projects, which also can lead to projects co-ownership and mobilisation of local financing.
The investment concepts would allow a large number of islands and regions to access the various innovative financing streams which are being structured (e.g. PDA, ESIF Financial Instruments, National Investment Platforms), to increase the absorption rates of EFSI and to access private finance.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to set up and run a 'European Islands Facility' which offers expertise and/or financial support and services to islands:
The Islands Facility should offer expertise and/or financial support to develop, within a limited period of time, innovative cost-effective investment concepts based on (or the development of – if they do not yet exist) a transition plan and a coherent set of projects that will lead to a decarbonised, efficient and resilient island energy system using local energy flows and resources;
The Islands Facility should be able to provide, inter-alia: translation of ambitions into a holistic energy transition plan, assistance in modelling of the energy transition on the island(s), a clear identification of the individual potential project pipeline(s), legal analysis and support, a description of how the investments will be financed and, if relevant, how the financing will be mobilised locally, advice on available funds and a design of the process to launch the investments. It can also cover the support for information and engagement actions among the islands inhabitants in the view of ensuring their acceptance, projects participation and co-ownership, also mobilising local financing;
The Islands Facility should develop in-house expertise to coordinate, support the implementation and critically evaluate the outcomes on the above-mentioned issues, i.e. preparation of energy transition plans, modelling of the energy transition on the islands, identification and financing of project pipelines, legal analysis, so that it will create synergies between requests for assistance from different islands;
Besides the technical assistance, the Islands Facility will maintain a public, searchable portal with the energy transition plans and project proposals that it has supported and developed, share and spread knowledge and best practices based on a sound and inclusive outreach strategy, with the aim to engage as many islands as possible in the energy transition;
Proposals should foresee to provide support to third parties ('support scheme') as described in part K of the General Annexes of the Work Programme. At least 30%, and up to 70%, of the budget should be directly allocated for spending to island cities, municipalities or their groupings;
Proposals should demonstrate that they are deeply rooted in the ecosystem of island communities, of sustainable energy planners and project initiators, and of the financing community of energy efficiency and energy system transformations;
Proposals should include a strategy to include contributions from 3rd parties to its funding such as local, regional or national authorities (while maintaining autonomy in its activities), and a strategy to continue its work after the granted budget is finished;
Proposals should demonstrate that they are able to mobilise a critical mass of islands and set up the support scheme of the Islands Facility in accordance with H2020 standards;
Proposals have to foresee services to underpin European added value and earmark appropriate resources (at least 30%, and up to 70%, of the requested EU contribution) to make experts available directly to the islands, provide the necessary quality control over the experts' outputs, and ensure that the results are used by other islands;
Proposals should demonstrate how they are able to select and prioritise islands for support under this facility, based on the following requirements: in order to qualify for support through the Islands Facility, islands must demonstrate proof of political commitment, an ambitious scale of potential investment and level of energy savings relevant to the island, investment sector targeted and type of financial solution envisaged, governance to develop the investment concept, a plan for long-term capacity building within the public administration, a plan on how they will include citizens and other stakeholders, and a commitment for monitoring for 2 years;
Proposals should include a task to establish links and synergies with R&I projects selected under LC-SC3-ES-4-2018-2020: Decarbonising energy systems of geographical Islands under the BRIDGE initiative.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of 10 million EUR would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below using quantified indicators and targets wherever possible:
Demonstration and documentation of increased leveraging of finance into energy transition investments by public authorities;
Overall, for every million Euro of Horizon 2020 support the action should trigger energy transition investments worth at least EUR 10 million;
Number of investment concepts delivered, and number of concepts that turned into tangible investments after the provided support;
Number of public authority staff with increased capacity for developing investible energy transition projects;
Innovation uptake by potential replicators;
Primary energy savings, GHG reductions, renewable energy production and investments in sustainable energy triggered by participating public authorities after the support of the action (respectively in GWh/year and in million EUR of investments).

","15 May 2018
","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The EU needs to accelerate the transformation of its energy system by bridging the gap between research and commercial deployment with innovative solutions. Bridging this gap often requires substantial volumes of investment which cannot be allocated by individual countries or by the European Commission on their own. Mobilising the necessary investment can only be achieved by pooling together financial resources from multiple countries, the Commission, and the private sector. This is a challenge because the funding landscape is complex.
One of the objectives of the SET Plan is to create funding synergies on such a big scale by organising joint programming actions between the entities responsible for public funding programmes and the Commission. ERA-NETs are a key instrument for joint programming actions within the SET Plan, and they also contribute to achieving the objectives of the European Research Area (ERA). In addition, they can play a key role in achieving the goal of the Energy Union of moving away from a fragmented system characterised by uncoordinated national policies and towards an integrated European R&I approach which accelerates the transformation of the energy system.
Areas suitable for ERA-NETs will be identified by Member States' / Associated Countries' representatives in the SET Plan governance bodies (in particular the Joint Actions Working Group). They will then be developed from the early stages in close collaboration with the European Commission and with input from the Programme Committee as needed. This collaboration will ensure that proposed ERA-NETs are in line with energy R&I and SET Plan policy objectives.
Scope:
Actions should aim at coordinating the efforts of participating Member States, Associated Countries and Regions towards achieving SET Plan objectives and, where they exist, executing the Implementation Plans jointly developed by SET Plan countries' representatives, industry and research organisations within the SET Plan priority areas numbers 1 to 9 [1]. In establishing their thematic scope, proposals will also take into due consideration support already provided through other topics in this work programme part. As for their technology development scope, proposals can support projects addressing any stage of the innovation chain through joint calls.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from participating national or regional research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding. Proposers are requested to also implement other joint activities, including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.
Proposals shall include provision for at least one joint call without EU funding on top of the compulsory co-funded joint call.
Proposals shall specify which additional activities will be carried out as part of the action in accordance with the definition given in General Annex D.
It is expected that actions funded through this topic will bring together national and regional programme owners and programme managers who represent diverse conditions and approaches from the EU.
Participation of legal entities from third countries is also encouraged in the joint calls and in additional joint activities, on the basis of common interest and mutual benefit. Participants from these countries may request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) for the coordination costs of additional activities.
Expected Impact:
It is expected that actions will help to:
Establish long-lasting joint programming research efforts between Member States/Associated Countries/Regions in areas of common interest;
Accelerate the time to commercial deployment of affordable, cost-effective and resource-efficient technology solutions which decarbonise the energy system in a sustainable way;
Reduce the environmental impact of the energy system;
Make a measurable contribution to the objectives of the Energy Union, the SET Plan, and the European Research Area;
Achieve a funding leverage effect of at least 5:1 between national, regional and private sector contributions, on the one hand, and EU contributions on the other.

","26 November 2015
","18 October 2017","Specific Challenge:
The European transport sector must have the capacity to deliver the best products and services, in a time and cost efficient manner, in order to preserve its leadership and create new jobs, as well as to tackle the environmental and mobility defies. The role of SMEs to meet these challenges in all the areas of the Transport Specific Programme[1] is critical as they are key players in the supply chains. Enhancing the involvement of weaker players in innovation activities as well as facilitating the start-up and emergence of new high-tech SMEs is of paramount importance. SMEs are pivotal for delivering the innovations needed for greater sustainable and smarter mobility, better accessibility and logistics serving business and citizens, and thus higher economic growth, in a context where the majority of population lives in urban and urbanised areas. Actions to develop new services, products, processes, technologies, systems and combinations thereof that contribute to achieving the European transport and mobility goals defined in the 2011 Transport White Paper could be particularly suited for this call.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[2],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[3]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[4]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [5]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[6] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impacts should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

","26 November 2015
","09 November 2017","Specific Challenge:
The European transport sector must have the capacity to deliver the best products and services, in a time and cost efficient manner, in order to preserve its leadership and create new jobs, as well as to tackle the environmental and mobility defies. The role of SMEs to meet these challenges in all the areas of the Transport Specific Programme[1] is critical as they are key players in the supply chains. Enhancing the involvement of weaker players in innovation activities as well as facilitating the start-up and emergence of new high-tech SMEs is of paramount importance. SMEs are pivotal for delivering the innovations needed for greater sustainable and smarter mobility, better accessibility and logistics serving business and citizens, and thus higher economic growth, in a context where the majority of population lives in urban and urbanised areas. Actions to develop new services, products, processes, technologies, systems and combinations thereof that contribute to achieving the European transport and mobility goals defined in the 2011 Transport White Paper could be particularly suited for this call.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[2],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[3]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[4]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [5]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.

","SME instrument phase 2
","26 November 2015
","18 October 2017","Specific Challenge:
SMEs, including social enterprises and cultural actors, can build their growth on business model innovation, taking into account new opportunities arising from servitisation, from individual empowerment, from a more collaborative economy, from opening up government data and services and from the pervasive use of new technologies. A change of paradigm from ownership to access, from individual consumption to shared functionalities can be applied in several sectors benefiting from digital technologies and ensuring more sustainable lifestyles to EU citizens particularly in cities. A similar paradigm shift is happening in the relationship between government, citizens and businesses, where societal actors take on a more proactive role in the design and delivery of public services. One of the main challenges is to attract business to use public platforms to create more value as current business models do not adequately exploit the benefits of participation and collaboration with government. New ways of creating, producing, consuming, using, educating, learning, caring, moving and living are emerging in European cities. New ways of exploiting tangible and intangible cultural heritage are made possible. News ways of creating innovative public services, using open data and open public services provide new business opportunities. SMEs developing and adapting new business models play a key role in these transformations. The specific challenge addressed by this topic is to enable SMEs in traditional and new sectors, collaborative economy and creative sectors, cultural heritage and the social economy as well as collaborative public service creation to innovate and grow across traditional boundaries, through new business models and organisational change.

","SME instrument phase 1
","26 November 2015
","09 November 2017","Specific Challenge:
SMEs, including social enterprises and cultural actors, can build their growth on business model innovation, taking into account new opportunities arising from servitisation, from individual empowerment, from a more collaborative economy, from opening up government data and services and from the pervasive use of new technologies. A change of paradigm from ownership to access, from individual consumption to shared functionalities can be applied in several sectors benefiting from digital technologies and ensuring more sustainable lifestyles to EU citizens particularly in cities. A similar paradigm shift is happening in the relationship between government, citizens and businesses, where societal actors take on a more proactive role in the design and delivery of public services. One of the main challenges is to attract business to use public platforms to create more value as current business models do not adequately exploit the benefits of participation and collaboration with government. New ways of creating, producing, consuming, using, educating, learning, caring, moving and living are emerging in European cities. New ways of exploiting tangible and intangible cultural heritage are made possible. News ways of creating innovative public services, using open data and open public services provide new business opportunities. SMEs developing and adapting new business models play a key role in these transformations. The specific challenge addressed by this topic is to enable SMEs in traditional and new sectors, collaborative economy and creative sectors, cultural heritage and the social economy as well as collaborative public service creation to innovate and grow across traditional boundaries, through new business models and organisational change.
Scope:
The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.
In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[1],
innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.
Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.
In phase 2, innovation projects[2]
will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.
Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').
Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]
would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months. [4]
Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.
All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.
This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:
Access to markets
Access to finance
In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.
SME Instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.
Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.
Expected Impact:
Enhancing profitability and growth performance of SMEs by combining and transferring new and existing knowledge into innovative, disruptive and competitive solutions seizing European and global business opportunities.
Market uptake and distribution of innovations[5] tackling the specific challenges in a sustainable way.
Increase of private investment in innovation, notably leverage of private co-investor and/or follow-up investments.
The expected impacts should be clearly described in qualitative and quantitative terms (e.g. on turnover, employment, market seize, IP management, sales, return on investment and profit).

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Innovation procurement can drive the R&D and deployment of innovative solutions from the demand side through respectively pre-commercial procurement (PCP). This can open new market opportunities for companies in Europe, can contribute to speeding up public sector modernisation and can help to tackle societal challenges with innovative/breakthrough solutions for the benefit of the citizen.
Satellite navigation technology is an increasingly common component of innovative applications in different market segments. Involvement of public institutions is key in fostering the EGNSS adoption. Nowadays the maturity of EGNSS based solutions and their increased accessibility provide significant contribution to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals of the governments.
The main challenge of this topic is to deepen user integration and thus foster exploitation of EGNSS applications to match the needs of public authorities at national, regional or local levels.
The innovative EGNSS solutions developed through this action should have been tested and have demonstrated success in smaller scale settings and have not yet been deployed on a large scale.
Scope:
The objective is to launch demand-driven actions by public authorities aiming at customising EGNSS applications for their needs. Transnational cooperation has a key role to play in this context, as it can facilitate knowledge transfer and optimisation of resources for public authorities. Proposals should be building on procurement needs of the participating organizations. The proposals should support the EGNSS market take-up across Europe and demonstrate a sustainability of solutions beyond the lifespan of the proposed project. The choice of EGNSS market segment and application is left to the proposer. A non-exhaustive list of possible applications is presented below:
EGNSS for mobility as a service, cooperative ITS, public transport and smart cities,
Implementation of Performance Based Navigation procedures,
Integration of EGNSS into U-Space concept for drones,
Helicopter emergency medical services with EGNOS capabilities (operations and equipment).
Public rescue services with Galileo SAR capable helicopters, boats and drones
EGNSS to support port operations,
Monitoring of infrastructure with EGNSS (rail, road, critical infrastructure)
The consortium should engage public procurers from each country represented in the consortium (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant EGNSS market segment.
Proposals should be built on the exploitation of the distinguishing features of EGNOS and Galileo signals and operational advantages in downstream applications.
EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies is required to make the application(s) work, this is not excluded from the scope.
Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope of this topic.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Activities related to this topic should contribute to:
The establishment of buyer groups for EGNSS application;
Creation of EGNSS-enabled national, regional or local applications in support of public authorities;
Fostering the emergence of similar EGNSS actions in smart specialisation strategies;
Establishment of sustainable supply chains for delivery of downstream EGNSS applications to public authorities;
Smart use of the procurement budget to remove supplier lock-in and obtain more open, standardized and better “value for money” solutions;
Increase in quality, and decrease in prices, of EGNSS products and services;
Increased exploitation of IPRs and R&D results;
Creation of growth and jobs in Europe.

Specific challenge:Process control of the industrial operations has a major role in assuring high quality standards and optimal operations in terms of resource use and economic viability. Technological progresses in this area that could allow measuring properties of process streams and final products, accurately and in real-time could represent a major step forward towards more reliable and sustainable industrial operations. These real time process data (e.g. chemical composition or biological contamination data) could allow the implementation of “near real time” closed-loop process control concepts making it possible to operate industrial processes at their optimum both economically and ecologically while ensuring high level of safety.. To obtain real time process data, the development of reliable fast inline measurements will be fundamental. These measurements can easily be integrated into closed loop process control concepts, thus delivering the highest value and near real time process control for industrial operations and decision-making support tools, facilitated, for instance, by integrated databases covering measurements and computational data. The development of these new “near real time” integrated process control methods is particularly important considering the recently introduced intensified or modularised production concepts, e.g. presenting smaller continuously operated pieces of equipment or integration of process steps that pose new challenges for process analytics in terms of size and speed of analysis.
Scope:
New technologies suitable for “near real time” integrated process control are expected to introduce significant novelties with respect to sensor technologies, data treatment and data mining, in particular:
-          Provision of dynamic information about product properties, stream characteristics and process conditions.
-          Provision of spatially resolved process data.
-          Data management for processes optimisation.
-          Sensors for intensified process technology.
-          Fast inline measurements (instead of extractive ones).
-          Robustness and reliability insuring minimum operation and maintenance costs.
Proposals submitted under this topic should address several aspects which are considered of major importance in this area; such as:
-          Cross-sectorial application of process analyser technology (PAT) and product measurement techniques (PPMT) in closed-loop process control capable of inline measurements.
-          Integration methodologies within a large number of production conditions.
-          Swarm sensors.
-          Development of new soft-sensors and sensing concepts and models for improved process control using PAT data for the measurement of properties and quality of process streams and final products.
-          Miniaturised PAT- and PPMT-based advanced control for intensified processes.
-          Disposable sensors in batch and in continuous processes.
-          Control strategies for flexible processes or disposable sensors using integrated and validated PAT data.
-          Process and Product life cycle management.
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to demonstrate the proposed technologies and control systems in relevant industrial environments, to prove their technical feasibility and economic viability.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 3-5. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                     Improved capabilities for valid, reliable and real-time measurement of the properties and quality of process streams and final products for existing and for more flexible process operation concepts.
                     More sustainable plant operations due to the extensive usage of all information available from validated PAT and PPMT measurements for model based control.
                     Improved monitoring and control of continuous plants.
                     Improved support of the operators leading to safer, more reliable and sustainable process operation improving process efficiency.
                     Better process operations with respect to resource and energy efficiency.
                     Significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.
                     Strengthening of the competiveness of the European industry both in the domain of PAT technologies and control solutions and with respect to economically sustainable industrial processes.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Nowadays, 12% of water utilisation in the EU is devoted to industrial use. Since water is a scarce resource, it is crucial for the European industry to change the current paradigm and develop more sustainable and efficient water technologies, which is also an important element for increasing its competitiveness, because a significant amount of energy is consumed for industrial water treatment. In the sustainable development context, efficient water use is closely linked to the efficient use and re-use of other resources, such as energy, chemicals, raw materials and soils. As such, these aspects need to be considered holistically in order to develop sustainable solutions.
Scope:
The main objective is the optimisation of the use of water in industry. Research activities should focus on several of the following areas:
Combining existing technologies (e.g. advanced processing, nano-technology and materials) in order to achieve enhanced sustainability in water treatment processes by reducing water use, energy and raw materials consumption and at the same time minimizing waste and/or recovering valuable substances.
Selective separation processes in order to be able to treat specific industrial fluxes, also leading to the recovery of valuable substances.
Adaptation of current processes or equipment to use alternative water sources. e.g. rainwater, salt or brackish water, cooling water, or Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) effluent.
Alternative cooling/heating methods. Reducing the energy levels that are needed for water and steam related production processes; dry cooling technologies; water and energy recovery processes from water vapour.
Use of renewable energy, in order to achieve low energy water treatment processes (e.g. photo-degradation of pollutants).
Development of closed loop recycling and reuse, involving cascading of processes and industrial water symbiosis.
Development of a sustainable strategy for selecting materials and infrastructure for water transport and use, including water storage and treatment.
The proposals should also include a Life cycle analysis, since it offers the framework to deliver meaningful information on the ""water footprint"" of manufactured goods, delivered services, business operations and consumer behaviour. The total footprint of the process regarding water, energy and resources should be considered.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6. This topic addresses cross-KET activities. The proposals are expected to allocate at least 30% of the budget to demonstration activities.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Reduction of at least 20% in water use compared to the current practice in the sector.
Reduction of at least 30% in wastewater production compared to the current practice in the sector.
Reduction of at least 15% in energy use compared to the current practice in the sector.
Minimising the Water Footprint, employing less water intensive or waterless technologies and increasing recycling.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The context and customer field of satellite communication services is currently undergoing changes. Broadband TV applications are decreasing in importance and the importance of internet connectivity is increasing. New EU targets have been set to achieve a connectivity of 100 Mbps for all by 2025[1], for which satellite communication solutions are important, for instance in remote and offshore areas, for backhauling, or for mobile users and under emergency situations. The demand for Very High Throughput satellite communications is increasing. The 5G concept combines various access technologies, such as cellular, wireless, satellite and wireline, for delivering reliable performance for critical communications and improve area coverage[2][3] making interconnectivity an important challenge. New markets are emerging, such as for example the connectivity needed for Internet of Things. New mission concepts are currently being established, such as mega constellations or satellite networks based on micro-mini satellites. Finally, security aspects are becoming more and more important, in particular for governmental users of satellite communications. The challenge for the EU is to prepare the ground to maintain the technological leading edge and maintain its global competitiveness in satellite communications in those rapidly changing conditions and markets (e.g. towards and beyond the 1 Tbps high throughput satellites and/or fully flexible satellites).
Sub-topics presented in the “SPACE-15-TEC-2018: Satellite communication technologies” call and addressed by selected projects, are not repeated in SPACE-29-TEC-2020.
Scope:
Proposals shall address only one of the following sub-topics:
a) Secure and robust satellite communications including quantum technologies, such as key generation and distribution, adapting to quantum technologies, anti-jamming technologies and products, anti-spoofing techniques, advanced coding, signal modulation and cryptography, secured uncoordinated multiple access, threats simulation, secure and robust telemetry, tracking and command (spread spectrum);
b) Bandwidth efficient transmission techniques to serve multiple users with high throughput satellites and to ensure effective use of limited spectrum resources, e.g. frequency management and allocation techniques, such as dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and frequency reuse; multiple antenna communications; beamforming; cooperative gateway diversity, user clustering and interference mitigation;
c) High speed processing and flexible and reprogrammable telecommunication payloads, able to adapt to changing service needs such as capacity flexibility and geographic redistribution of the traffic and to satellites integration in the 5G protocol and system. Simulation and end-to-end resources management shall be addressed;
d) Flexible broadband passive and active antenna techniques, such as phased array or mechanically steered or hybrid mechanical/electronic steerable antennas for very high throughput spaceborne or airborne communication applications (consisting of broadband conformal antenna arrays, broadband beamforming and broadband RF front-ends and components), including multi-beaming smart antennas and integration of antennas in the platform, multiband and hybrid (RF/optical) antennas, active antenna critical technologies, lens antenna techniques, 5G dedicated active arrays, RF equipment for higher frequency bands (e.g. Q, V/W).
e) Ground systems technologies for satellite communication services and applications: evolution of ground control stations and teleports, also making use of artificial intelligence, improving the interoperability of networks of ground stations and inter-satellite links, enabling full interoperability with future terrestrial telecommunication networks (including 5G terrestrial network) and optimising performance, coverage, costs, reliability and security in the provision of differentiated services and applications to diverse user categories,.
Maximum one proposal per sub-topic will be selected.
Proposals should consider enabling technologies and solutions aiming at exploiting the potential synergies between the Satellite Communication domain and the Navigation and Earth Observation domain (such as EO/SatCom hybrid mission satellites, smart satellites, small satellites, high data rate solutions, high speed links, high performance processors, antennas/reflector/structures, ground segment).
Participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.
The involvement of post-graduate scientists, engineers and researchers and the promotion of gender balance is encouraged, for example through professional work experience or through fellowships/scholarships as applicable.
Actions should be complementary and create synergy with other European activities in the same domain. Emphasis should be given to the preparation of future and advanced satellite communications technologies up to TRL 4-5. Technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be enhanced between European non-space and space industries.
To this end, proposals shall include the following tasks:
Analysis of relevant available roadmaps, including roadmaps developed in the context of actions for the development of Key Enabling Technologies supported by the Union;
Commercial assessment of the supply chain technology in the space or non-space domains and, if applicable, a business plan for commercialisation with a full range (preload) of recurring products.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals under this topic may be subject to security scrutiny if they could potentially lead to security-sensitive results that should be classified (see guide for classification available at the Funding & Tenders Portal).
Expected Impact:
To ensure and enhance the life-cycle cost reduction (including manufacturing and operations) and increased performance, resulting in the enhanced competitiveness of the European space manufacturing and service industry in the rapidly evolving field of satellite communication.
To develop European research and technology ecosystems consisting of different parties involved in satellite communications, i.e. manufacturers of user equipment, ground segment technologies, service providers and operators, validation and simulation tool developers, and end users.
To contribute to the integration of satellite communications into the 5G.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:Decentralised on-site plants and modular approaches towards small- and medium-scale production will play a significant role in tomorrow’s process industry. However, the use of highly intensified, miniaturized equipment is largely restricted to gas/liquid and liquid/liquid systems, while most processes applied in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, as well as industries processing steel, glass, cement, non-ferrous metals, or minerals, involve solids as reactants, catalysts, intermediates or (by-)products. If these processes are to be transferred to intensified process equipment, it is likely that difficulties associated with the presence of particulate solids will be encountered, such as fouling or blockages. Robust and sustainable solutions to these problems are hardly available. This hampers the industrial realization of processes involving solids handling.
A further challenge of increasing importance for these industries comes from the increasingly demanding customer expectations with regard to product properties. These specific needs have to be met by developing fast and flexible processes that allow for design and development of tailor-made products while keeping the time-to-market as short as possible. One possible solution is to build on continuous processes, which can significantly reduce development time as well as scale-up efforts.
Scope:Methods should be developed for the handling of solids in continuous production units. This can be achieved either by the miniaturization of currently available devices or – to a great extent – by completely new approaches to the processing of solids. Projects should apply a holistic approach towards relevant processes in which solids are an intrinsic part. Rather than the core processes for solids handling, the whole process design should be considered, in particular downstream processing operations such as catalyst recycling, solids isolation, waste treatment, or waste prevention. This can be realised by means of flexible, e.g. modular and fast process design. Such an approach would foster regionalised production. Case studies should be included on several of the following aspects:
-       Metering of solids
-       Advanced analytic systems
-       Transport of solids
-       Control of agglomeration
-       Reduction of fouling
-       Cleaning concepts, e.g. CIP
-       Solid separation and recycling
-       Regulatory requirements 
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5-7.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Novel, efficient and cost effective production concepts realized in commercially available process intensified equipment, respectively process equipment modules.
                Innovative modules allowing to process solids in medium to small scale production units (particular emphasis should be given to the SPIRE sectors).
                Amelioration of chemical applications accessible via process intensified reaction systems through whole process design with focus on solids (downstream) processing operations.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
CO2 represents an alternative, abundant and valuable source of carbon which could be a suitable raw material, and its utilization has the potential to contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thereby unwanted climate change effects. In addition, the utilisation of CO2 (and CO) as a feedstock by the European process industry to produce materials, chemicals and fuels could be a key solution to reduce the dependence on imports of fossil resources provide a secure of supply of carbon feedstock while contributing to the emission reductions agreed at COP21.
The chemical industry is still largely based on the use of fossil fuels and feedstock as source of carbon, but a decrease is necessary in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The utilisation of CO2 (and CO) to produce added value chemicals may represent a viable opportunity. While there are still significant scientific technological challenges to be solved in order to exploit the CO2 (and CO) as a carbon source in a more systematic manner, there have already been concepts demonstrated at lab scale, which could provide possible solutions if properly scaled up. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of such CO2 (and CO) utilisation technologies to produce added value products at larger scale, in an operational environment, to be able to assess the industrial potential of such technologies.
Scope:
Proposals should address innovative chemical (e.g. catalytic) processes to produce added value chemicals from CO2 (and CO) and demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility in an industrially relevant environment through demonstration of a system prototype. Technologies targeting conversion of CO2 (and CO) to short chain alcohols, dimethyl ether and fuels are considered outside the scope of this topic.
The topic focuses on the conversion of CO2 (and CO) to chemicals, possibly including chemicals with other components beyond C, H and O (such as N), in an integrated approach and therefore, the proposals need to consider the following elements:
CO2 (and CO) should come preferably from industrial flue and process gases from the process industries e.g., cement, steel and other energy intensive industries
CO2 (and CO) purification and conditioning methods to bring the gas to a sufficient quality for efficient conversion into chemicals.
The testing of a system prototype should be integrated with process modelling and life cycle assessment in order to quantify the processes in terms of resource intensity reduction as well as reduction of emissions.
The quality of the products obtained should relate to the specifications requested by the market.
The project should contain an analysis of the economic feasibility and impact, and the evaluation of the market potential, and benefit on the European competiveness deriving from the introduction of the new process.
An analysis of the environmental and social benefits.
Proposals should involve industries in a clear leadership role.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Demonstrate technical and economic feasibility in the relevant environment of novel processes for CO2 and CO conversion to added-value chemicals.
Reduction of at least 20%, on Life-Cycle-Assessment basis, of the emissions of greenhouse gases and energy/resource intensity with respect to commercial manufacturing of the same product. The impact on greenhouse emissions will be an important element of the evaluation.
Significant increase of the industrial competiveness deriving from the adoption of the novel processes of conversion of CO2 and CO to added-value chemicals.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Although the European process industry holds a globally strong position, it is losing competitiveness in the face of world regions which are richer in raw materials and/or have lower energy, labour and environmental costs. Consequently, in order to maintain its competitiveness on the global stage, it will be important to substantially improve its performance, as well as the energy and resource efficiency of its operations. In addition, the existing industrial processes often do not provide sufficient flexibility (e.g. ability to easily change production rates) making them unable to meet the demand for fluctuating production volumes and seasonal production campaigns requiring in situ processing (e.g. bio-mass, limited batches), which would benefit from flexible and/or mobile production systems that do not require extensive infrastructure (e.g. containerised approach).
During the last decade, several concepts have been developed and reported to enable more flexible, compact and cost effective processes proposing a variety of process intensification methodologies, which have the potential to achieve the very significant improvements in performances, energy usage and material efficiency sought by the industry. However, these concepts have mostly been demonstrated/validated at laboratory/small scale and further work is needed to fully assess their industrial potential in terms of performances, techno-economic feasibility and scalability, in order to contribute to a circular economy in the European market.
Scope:
Proposals are expected to identify and demonstrate innovative, compact, high performance production lines for existing and novel products with significantly lower operational and investment costs (compared to their existing analogues). This may be achieved by adaptation, redesign of existing process units or by completely new concepts, possibly using process optimised materials, provided that a significant improvement in cost, flexibility and performance can be achieved, compared to the commercially available processes. The approach proposed should allow short time-to-market and integration in currently existing plants, while ensuring a high flexibility (e.g. production lines with a broad turn-down ratio or by using parallel modular units for adapting capacity).
Proposals should address all of the following activities:
The proposed solutions should encompass the elimination, combination or replacement of one or more process steps/units aiming to achieve significant efficiency improvement and higher productivity and flexibility, while ensuring lower capital and operation costs.
Significant demonstration activities in a relevant industrial environment are expected, which will allow validating the productivity and flexibility improvements and provide clear indications on the scalability, replicability and potential for its integration in existing industrial plants.
Techno-economic analysis (including LCA) providing a basis for economic and industrial feasibility for the innovative, high performance, flexile/scalable production lines that will be demonstrated, as well as a business plan for the deployment of the technology.
Demonstration of the integration in existing industrial scenarios would be a major added-value.
The proposal should include clear steps for the deployment of the concepts in industry (e.g. including clear business cases and a work package on business plans).
The proposal should provide evidence on the concept potential for job creation.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business scenarios, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6.This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
The equipment size/production-capacity ratio, energy and resource consumption, or waste production will be significantly improved by more than 30% compared to existing approaches. The targets should be quantified in the proposal and validated during the execution of the demonstration.
Project outcomes should demonstrate a positive environmental impact, by reducing by-products and/or waste generation, as well as reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption compared to the state of the art and in the scale relevant for the different applications
The novel processes/production lines should contribute to lowering the investment and/or operating costs by at least 20% compared to existing approaches. The targets should be quantified in the proposal and validated during the execution of the demonstration.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Europe is facing a large emission of CO2-containing gases and at the same time a need for additional carbon-based resources. Whereas today the carbon flow of the process industries is organised in a linear way from feedstock input to output of product plus emission (among other residues), the objective is to facilitate a cyclic flow in which CO2-containing gases from one industry becomes the feedstock of another.
Due to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), the process industry is increasingly looking into the potential use of non-conventional fossil natural resources (e.g. shale gas, gas hydrates, tar sands, coal bed methane, gas to liquid and coal to liquid technologies) as alternative feedstock. Moreover, some organic solid wastes (both from domestic and from industrial applications) can be used to obtain carbon based gas (e.g. biogas, syngas).
The challenge is to understand how to turn these different carbon sources into chemicals that can be used as sustainable building blocks or fuels, while at the same time the process is economically feasible depending on the different energy price scenarios. The aim is to perform a forecast study for the use of CO2 containing process gases as feedstock for process industries, by means of the conversion of CO2 and CO to carbon-derived products. Converting these gases into chemicals and products could lead to a major reduction of emissions and dependency on fossil fuels.
Presently the prices for the emission of CO2 are dropping significantly compared to the initial prediction (e.g. in the ETS scheme) and at the same time both fossil based and renewable feedstock are highly volatile on the world market. Therefore, there is an urgent need to forecast different possible scenarios for a sustainable use of carbon resources and how this can be organised in a cyclic flow in the process industry.
Scope:
There is a strong need to evaluate the novel technologies and solutions for the use of CO2/CO containing process gas as well as non-conventional fossil natural resources at production site level together with the economic feasibility. Furthermore, it is required to compile information on and create awareness on the relative maturity and adaptability of technologies to the local situations, with the aim to accelerate market adoption and replication of these solutions.
Some of the targeted chemicals offer dual use as an intermediate in chemical production as well as an energy carrier such as chemical energy storage. Therefore, the proposed technology not only links CO2-producing and intensive carbon sectors but addresses various high-volume applications and significant markets.
The focus of the forecast study should be on the use of CO2/CO containing process gases to produce high value added products (e.g. fine chemicals and polymers).
The study should address an integrated approach including the following aspects:
To lay the foundation of the design of future facilities to demonstrate conversion of CO2-containg gas into chemicals on site.
The design of scenarios for the proper and most valuable uses of different gas resources.
To analyse the need for pre and post-conversion separation and conditioning processes
To evaluate the potential impacts of the use of non-conventional fossil natural resources on the CO2/CO use and identify best solutions
The scenarios should be linked to Life Cycle Assessment to provide a basis for sustainability, leading to acceptance and recognition of new “clean” products, business models, and skill sets.
All aspects above should take into consideration the following issues: i) the most carbon efficient process; ii) the technical challenges that hamper the deployment of technical solutions at demonstration scale; and iii) the challenge of building a new model for integrating different industrial sectors.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 250000 and 500000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one project will be funded.
Expected Impact:
New scenarios for increased use of CO2/CO containing process gases and non-conventional fossil natural resources as new feedstock depending on future fossil fuel and energy prices.
Strategies to facilitate the use of primary fossil feedstock displacement (downstream consuming industry).
Future scenarios that enable new business models improving competitiveness of participating industries based on the use of CO2/CO containing process gases and non-conventional natural resources as feedstock for the process industry.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:manufacturing sustainability has been improved considerably in environmental, economic and social terms, by sharing resources (e.g. plants, energy, water, residues and recycled materials) through the integration of multiple production units of a single company or multiple companies on a single industrial production site. Nevertheless, a more general cross-sectorial interaction is needed for a major impact within the process industry. This could take a long time to achieve and the aim is to pave the way for future cross-sectorial interactions and potentialities in the development of holistic measurements and activities. 
Currently, poor understanding of each other's processes is hindering the development of technical and non-technical interactions and exchanges, which are necessary for industry to properly face the challenges.
Scope:Projects should enable the implementation of a broad variety of technologies, encompassing a wide range of disciplines, such as fundamental science, and plant engineering and management. The integration into a single management system of all these environmental, energy and economic factors is key for the improvement in efficiency of the process industries.
The proposed research should focus on the following areas:
-       Analysis and optimisation tools for flexible energy use and material flow integration should be developed, aiming at a holistic approach for resource management in process industries, suitable both for small and large scale in a flexible approach. To facilitate a proper dissemination and use, it is expected that standards-based software for measuring critical footprint issues and relevant data used into the daily routine of the plants/clusters will be developed.
-       Rapid transfer from lab-scale and conceptual design into testing at demonstration sites, using realistic industrial streams and process conditions. Pilot tests should focus on integrated solutions and tools adapted to the specific conditions in real production units. This will facilitate future industrial symbiosis between different sectors, by integrating energy and material flows within existing industrial parks.
-       New approaches that perform cost-saving optimisation of energy and resources supply and demand, in order to reduce the residues and costs in intensive industries, taking into consideration both economical and sustainability constraints.
Prototypes and pilot implementations in real industrial settings represent a clear added-value.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.
Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4-6. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Holistic energy and resource management systems should facilitate significant gains in sustainable processing with regard to several parameters (resource efficiency, energy efficiency and the emission performance).
                Optimisation of interdependencies and the identification of technology components allowing for a breakthrough regarding a cost effective reduction in the use of resources, which overcomes the difficult cross-company collaboration.
Optimisation of energy and resources supply and demand in selected areas should reduce the overall costs in energy intensive industries by at least 15%, by taking into consideration both economic and sustainability factors.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
The competitiveness of European manufacturing depends on producing differentiated and high added value products in an efficient and sustainable manner, with reduced production costs, increased product quality and minimised time to market. To create a long-lasting competitive advantage for the European process industry it is also needed to properly inter-relate the production with modern and innovative ways of doing business.
Therefore, technological innovation in sustainable manufacturing in the process industry needs to be matched with new business models, which may support industry and cross-sector clusters as well as industrial parks, while also allowing more flexible and delocalised operations. These new business models should be designed to address the barriers which have so far prevented regionally or locally adapted solutions, with an emphasis on technical but also non-technological barriers, such as legal, regulatory or cultural ones.
On the other hand, these new business models should allow the positive interactions between the different actors (firms, neighbouring municipalities, infrastructure administrations), which can allow positive outcomes in terms of accrued economic value associated with perceived level of attractiveness to inward investors, leading to jobs creation, and sustainable development promotion by local authorities, industries and policy makers. In addition, these business models should consider the influence of industrial consumer trends on future energy and resource systems to achieve ambitious sustainability paths, which will be very relevant for the whole market.
Scope:
New business solutions should enable higher throughput operations and allowing industry to produce in a distributed and small scale manner; these new business models are expected to be more flexible and demand-driven. Site re-optimization studies will help identifying barriers towards good practice solutions and integrating several industries or processes.
Activities should focus on all of the following areas:
To determine the spatial flexibility parameters which allow to optimise activities interdependence and to define the resource flexibility parameters which allow optimising yearly fluxes between companies
Integrated business model solutions for customer-driven supply chain management based on intensified processing.
To deliver design constraints for new decentralised locations, which would position them, if applied, in the industrial symbiosis category,
To pinpoint the routes which allow the reduction of carbon footprint at affordable interdependence investments
Scenarios for novel distributed and intensified processing, sourcing and design solutions linking individual ""home-based"" designers and manufacturers to the supply-chain, promoting social inclusion and deploying skills locally available.
Scenarios for local sourcing and supply, thus reducing the environmental footprint, taking into account both raw material and energy sources
The proposals are expected to include an evaluation of best use and practical cases for intensified processing, while also providing an understanding on the research needs to achieve rapid deployment of the novel business solutions in particular consumer-targeted domains and a roadmap for their implementation. All relevant supply-chain stakeholders should be considered (including representatives from socio-economic sciences) and it is expected that SMEs will play an important role in the deployment and application of future business models.
The needs of SMEs as part of the supply-chain should be addressed.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 250000 and 500000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
No more than one action will be funded.
Expected Impact:
A study on the research needs to develop new business model solutions that can support the return of delocalised manufacturing to Europe, in the order of at least 5% of the total manufacturing capacity, in the process industry sectors, within 5 years after the end of the study.
The overall aim is to obtain an understanding of how to achieve in the medium term new business model solutions which should provide:
Reduction in the environmental footprint compared to products produced in the traditional value chains by 10% through less stock, less waste, and less transportation;
Reduction of raw material by 15% through the creation of strong networks with related sources of raw material coming from different sources (primary and secondary) locally
Development of scenarios in order to identify the proper locations and opportunities associated to delocalised facilitates taking into account legal and social hampering factors
Increased business opportunities on a local scale.
More involvement of customers/users in the integrated innovative business model solutions.

Deadline date","Scope:
Specific challenge:Metals and other minerals, such as non-ferrous and ferrous metals, ceramics, glass, cement and chemicals are utilised in numerous applications in many industrial sectors. Their demand, in particular those used in specialised applications, will increase in the coming years. Because of their increasing importance or economic value, a key issue is the development of processes for an effective and efficient recovery of these materials, from primary sources or from waste streams of the current industrial processes. Novel integrated recovery processes should result in increased resource efficiency and sustainability for the European industry, allowing the recovery of significant amount of metals and other minerals, even from low concentration streams. This should lower the dependency on imports of these materials, sheltering Europe from possible shortages in supply and reducing production costs and environmental impacts.
Major improvements in separation processes are needed to achieve an efficient and cost effective recovery from the different streams in the process industries.
Scope: new approaches combining several existing techniques (e.g. precipitation, adsorption, extraction, physical or biological treatment and separation) or new alternative solutions could provide a cost-effective way to achieve major improvements in the efficiency of recovery operations for metals and other minerals, leading to waste reduction and minimising the environmental impact of industrial operations.
The proposed solutions should also have potential for integration in the current industrial scenario, and should be suitable for different sectors in the process industry. It is essential to consider the compatibility of the technologies with currently existing plants, taking into consideration the capital -intensive nature of some industrial sectors involved.
Demonstration activities should focus in the following research areas:
-                   Innovative technologies for minerals and metals treatment from solid, gaseous and/or liquid waste streams.
-                   Development of new approaches for the design and scale up of industrial processes. In particular, these innovative approaches should regard the primary process and the downstream separation as one single, integrated process aimed at designs that maximise not only productivity, but also resource efficiency.
-                   The proposed solutions should be easily integrated with the currently existing plants/technologies, taking into account the capital intensive nature of some relevant industrial sectors, providing tools for the design of such units and their integration with primary processes.
The projects selected under this topic are expected to carry out demonstration activities in industrial environments aimed at proving the industrial relevance and feasibility of the proposed technologies.
For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.
Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.
 Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5-7. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact:
                Proof of economic and industrial feasibility for the proposed technologies in the process industries and showing the real potential for reducing dependency from imports. In addition, the technologies are expected contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
                Life Cycle and Cost Assessments for the technologies developed.
                Significant impact on the resource efficiency of industrial sectors leading to a 40% increase in recovery of materials suitable for reprocessing compared to conventional processes.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Process industries are currently facing the challenge of an increase in the energy and raw materials cost, a few of them facing a relative scarcity. Raw materials resources are blended, mixed and transformed into finished products by means of different manufacturing processes. Material losses and variable yields in the different processes can mean a considerable increase in the total cost breakdown.
Input from end-of-life recycling is an important goal covered in previous Horizon 2020 Calls including the SPIRE-7-2015 topic. However, yield losses in the different production steps in process industries are still important and this leaves room for improvement (e.g. real losses in pipelines, the storage containers extraction operations, raw materials residues left in ovens, mixing bowls and mixer blades, altogether with inefficient or ineffective chemical reactions).
Improving the utilisation of raw materials resources (fluids, solids or gases) is essential to increase yields throughout the supply chain. The reduction in losses will also ensure a decrease of the environmental footprint and therefore contribute to a more sustainable industry and support the circular economy.
The challenge of a more efficient use of raw materials resources in order to deliver high performance and sustainable production must be accompanied by optimising material efficiency all along the process route and throughout the value chain.
Scope:
Proposals should address the technological improvements for both continuous and batch processes to improve material and energy efficiency in the entire production route. They should also identify key bottlenecks and resource efficiency improvement opportunities that will increase yields while optimising the energy consumption of the original processes. The process review and the implementation of improvements should also significantly increase the current production rates.
Research and Innovation activities should address all of the following areas:
Reduction of material losses during the upstream beneficiation, the intermediate processing, the final process stages. Improvement of both the yield and the energy efficiency of the production process routes.
Quality and process control that ensures process stability and robustness while allowing some flexibility at the inlet conditions and the development of tools to assess the optimal combination of material input and yield control.
Identification and use of KPIs based on energy, water and raw material resources consumption, carbon dioxide emissions that can ensure the sustainability of the processes.
Mapping of the material and energy flows across the entire production system to allow for a cross-sectorial integration and optimisation.
Evaluation and quantification of the emissions reduction by improving yield.
The proposals must include at least one demonstrator per process in a real industrial setting.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
At least 25% reduction in yield losses when compared to the current practice in the sector, by optimising/minimising production losses and an increased material consumption on interconnected cycles
At least 10% improvement in energy efficiency when compared to the current practice in the sector.
Identify bottlenecks and resource efficiency improvement opportunities
Identify knowledge gaps in the supply chain
Adoption of the new technological improvements for enhanced resource efficiency in industrial processes.
Contribution to achieving the objectives of the European Innovation Partnership on Raw Materials, in particular to the relevant impacts shown in Action I.4: Processing and refining of raw materials of the Strategic Implementation Plan[1], as well as the circular economy objectives in general.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Electrochemical processes have the potential to be highly efficient and thereby create less by-product waste compared to conventional chemical processes. Important reasons for the industrial interest include the use of less expensive starting materials, less aggressive process conditions (e.g. lower temperatures with less degradation of feed and/or product), fewer processing steps (for example electrochemical synthesis and product separation may be combined in one reactor), precise control of oxidation or reduction level by control of electrode potential and discovery of unique processing routes to establish new markets for products. In addition, electrochemical processes have the potential to replace polluting chemical reactions with more environmentally friendly electrochemical reactions.
Despite the large number of chemicals available in the market, electrochemical synthesis of chemicals has until now been limited to a narrow spectrum. However, advances in electrochemical synthesis and methods are now possible and facilitated by recent developments in materials science, nanotechnology, and by the development of new in-situ analytical techniques or the progress in multi-scale modelling. This provides opportunities for new approaches for the electrochemical manufacturing of products.
Intensive research into organic and inorganic electrochemical processing promises major developments in different applications, specifically with the prospect of greatly reduced electricity consumption and the use of electrical power generated from environmentally friendly production processes like wind and solar energy, thereby contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Scope:
Proposals should develop new electrochemical methodologies for industrial processing and provide a proof of the economic and industrial feasibility of the new technologies. The proposed solutions should also have the potential for integration into existing industrial operations. A prospect for a wider impact of the proposed solutions on the process industry is also needed.
Important aspects that should be taken into account are:
Easy integration with renewable energy (electricity from renewable production sources).
Electrochemical synthesis and/or electrolysis which allows the direct creation of products (e.g. fuels, chemicals, metals, nanomaterials and new functional surface layers).
Ease of operation at low temperature and pressure conditions.
Integration of product produced into existing storage and supply infrastructures.
Significant improvements in energy and resource efficiency compared to the commercially available analogue (or similar process) with reduction of direct and/or indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
Improvement in safety and the work environment.
Life Cycle Assessment to provide a basis for environmental sustainability.
Projects will carry out demonstration activities in industrial environments aimed at confirming the industrial relevance and feasibility of the proposed technologies, showing the potential for integration in existing operations.
Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.This topic addresses cross-KET activities.
This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.

Innovation for border and external security may draw, in particular, from novel technologies, provided that they are affordable, accepted by citizens and customized and implemented for the needs of security practitioners.
Scope:
Proposals are invited to address related research and innovation issues, in particular:
Sub-topic 1: [2018] Providing integrated situational awareness and applying augmented reality to border security
Currently, information is made available to border and coast guards in several formats and on different kinds of hardly interoperable displays. However, human cognitive is limited at managing information from several sources simultaneously and at handling too many separate pieces of equipment is a limit to their ability to act. Furthermore, border and coast guards often work in sparsely populated and remote areas where the availability of telecommunication networks may be an issue. Research and innovation should lead towards (cloud-based) integrated systems with simple but complete and highly-standardized interfaces showing real-time information in a user-friendly way that can assist border guards in decision-making, and in remaining in contact with their command and control centre in the actual context of operations. Water, land and air operating resources should be taken into account, to lead to enhanced concept of employment, integration and interoperability standards.
Sub-topic 2: [2018] Detecting fraud, verifying document validity, and alternative technologies to identifying people
The use of counterfeit travel documents at borders is a reality, which entails the risk of not identifying known criminals, including terrorists. It is a cross-cutting priority according to the EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2017[1], since it enables or enhances all types of serious and organized crime and terrorism. New countermeasures are needed to address potential frauds, in particular for the detection of morphed face images. The use of biometrics ""on the fly"" techniques for identification in a non-intrusive manner and without interrupting the flow of people is an area for further development, testing and validation.
Sub-topic 3: [2019] Security on-board passenger ships
Security on-board passenger ships is challenging, given the larger number of specific constraints that apply. To ensure security all along the ""life cycle"" of a voyage, new technologies can be implemented (together with methods for their deployment and possibly their integration into ship systems), as well as security novel procedures (including for embarkation and disembarkation, mooring at pier, etc.)
Sub-topic 4: [2019] Detecting threats in the stream of commerce without disrupting business
The flow of goods crossing borders is increasing, whilst ways of concealing methods for dangerous materials and illegally trafficked goods are improving. The detection of such dangerous and illegal goods should be facilitated by novel technologies and sensing strategies characterized by risk-based protection and non-intrusive security checks that can be implemented without disrupting business.
Proposals should target the automation and integration of existing technologies for the purpose of identifying the largest possible amount of threat materials and ensuring the full supervision of the logistic flow of goods. This would require exploiting information obtained through the analysis of cargo flow data available from open source and documentary control, intelligence gathering, risk management, as well as through physical detection or inspection of cargo in means of transport, luggage, or carried by individuals. The fitness for purpose of novel solutions should be validated at the EU external border, in a context chosen on the basis of a sound and factual risk analysis.
Of particular relevance: the enhancement of detection capabilities of contraband (mainly cigarettes) hidden in high density cargo (coal, iron ore) in particular for rail cargo transport, and well as the fight against illicit trafficking of radioactive and nuclear (NR) materials (including through the establishment of trans-European network of detection facilities with its specific concept of operations.
Sub-topic 5: [2020] Disruptive technologies for non-intrusive identification of hidden goods
Detecting and identifying illegal goods hidden in containers, train cars and truck structures at EU external borders (e.g. ports, wharfs, rail yards, …) is a need shared by border guard, customs and law enforcement authorities. Illegal goods, including drugs, weapons, explosives, radiological and nuclear material, are trafficked into Europe by criminal organisations using a range of methods and tools, which are very diverse (e.g. to minimize the risk of detection during transportation, some drugs may be transformed into a liquid and turned back into a solid at destination) and adaptable to specific border conditions. These may also include taking advantage of new technology to facilitate access to containers.
Research should focus on the use of improved sensing technologies. The availability of a system of sensors producing a highly detailed, user friendly, 3-dimensional insight into the internal structure of a container (or truck), and the type of cargo carried, in a limited amount of time, would in particular be a valuable disruptive innovation for the customs and border inspection community. The system of sensors should be suitable for deployment and operation in a flexible and relocatable way, including mechanisms to improve field usability. The system should also allow for a swift gathering and exchange of information with other systems in order to facilitate a faster and more accurate localisation and identification of illicit cargo, without the need to open containers (this being a clear improvement when compared to current capabilities).
In line with the above, the newly developed solutions should allow for interoperability with state of the art and with foreseeable future border and customs information systems in order to optimise the overall container screening process using a risk-based approach.
Proposals should conduct testing and validation in the relevant environment.
Sub-topic: [2018-2019-2020] Open
Proposals addressing other issues relevant to this challenge, based on a sound rationale and supported by a large number of relevant practitioners are invited to apply under this sub-topic (see eligibility and admissibility conditions.)
Proposals should lead to solutions developed, tested, and validated in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be addressed in a comprehensive and thorough manner.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this topic is expected to be up to TRL 5 to 6 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
Clear, realistic benchmarks against which to assess progress, so as to possibly stop the project if at mid-term review progress is not deemed sufficient.
Plan to provide confidence in the take up of project results after the completion of the project.
Medium term:
Evidence based knowledge, and developments performing beyond the current state of the art and leading quickly to innovation.
Technical and operational guidelines, recommendations and best practices set in the EUROSUR handbook and in the future handbook for coast guards (as per Article 53 of the European Border and Coast Guard regulation.)
Long term:
Implementation of solutions resulting from the legislative initiative in the ""Smart Borders"" package;
Implementation of actions of civilian nature identified in the EU Maritime Security Strategy action plan;
Implementation of the actions identified by the EU Strategy and Action Plan for customs risk management.

Proposals addressing other issues relevant to this challenge, based on a sound rationale and supported by a large number of relevant practitioners are invited to apply under this sub-topic (see eligibility and admissibility conditions.)
Proposals should lead to solutions developed, tested, and validated in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be addressed in a comprehensive and thorough manner.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this topic is expected to be up to TRL 5 to 6 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
Clear, realistic benchmarks against which to assess progress, so as to possibly stop the project if at mid-term review progress is not deemed sufficient.
Plan to provide confidence in the take up of project results after the completion of the project.
Medium term:
Evidence based knowledge, and developments performing beyond the current state of the art and leading quickly to innovation.
Technical and operational guidelines, recommendations and best practices set in the EUROSUR handbook and in the future handbook for coast guards (as per Article 53 of the European Border and Coast Guard regulation.)
Long term:
Implementation of solutions resulting from the legislative initiative in the ""Smart Borders"" package;
Implementation of actions of civilian nature identified in the EU Maritime Security Strategy action plan;
Implementation of the actions identified by the EU Strategy and Action Plan for customs risk management.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Solutions at high Technological Readiness Levels (TRL; please see General Annex G) to enhance border and external security do exist, but if they are not to remain unused they need to be demonstrated in the context of actual operations or exercises for validation by practitioners.
Scope:
Consortia are invited to propose demonstration of high (6-8) Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) systems applied in the context of border and external security. (TRL: please see General Annex G.)
Proposals should be submitted under only one of the following sub-topics:
Sub-topic 1: [2018] Remotely piloted aircrafts and underwater autonomous platforms to be used from on-board offshore patrol vessels
Remotely piloted autonomous platforms of all kinds should demonstrate innovative capacities for land border and coast surveillance. Underwater autonomous platforms are also of interest for choke points surveillance (i.e. a port entrance.)
Research on artificial intelligence is likely to facilitate the transition from innovation to operation. Such platforms play an important role in facilitating long range and persistent surveillance in wide maritime areas, complementing operation from offshore patrol vessels. Improving the cost effectiveness, reliability and availability of such platforms, either by increasing the performance of existing technologies or by developing innovative concepts of operation, would notably contribute to better situational awareness at the tactical level beyond coastal waters (up to 200 nautical miles), while reducing risks during search and rescue missions, including launch and recovery phases, even in adverse sea and weather conditions. Proposals should aim at improved cost effectiveness, in particular through the remote operation of sensors mounted on aerial platforms (including optionally and remotely piloted) and by improving the on-board processing of payload data, while minimizing the data transmission to the ground segment.
Sub-topic 2: [2019] New concepts for decision support and information systems
Information systems to support border and external security may combine a broad variety of data from very different sources, including personal data. Innovative solutions are needed to ensure the interoperability of surveillance systems, and the availability of information for maritime border surveillance coming from the area of operations in standardized formats, when and where it is needed, thus at enhancing situation awareness at strategic level (in National Coordination Centres), but also at tactical level (with assets deployed under the frame of surveillance operations). This would allow faster reaction to incidents in the maritime domain, and a reduction in the death toll at sea. Proposals should aim at optimize the exploitation of data for their specific use in surveillance is currently embryonic, and needs to take better account of the specific characteristics of the domain, with a view to provide the needed information reducing redundancies.
Sub-topic 3: [2020] Improved systems for the vessel tracking, behaviour analysis and automatic anomaly detection
Current maritime reporting systems (including ship reporting systems and container reporting systems) produce huge quantities of data which cannot be directly exploited by the human operators in the various maritime control centres. This is expected to be even more so in the near future, as the amount of data available shall increase with the introduction of VHF Data Exchange System (VDES). At the same time, non-homogenous sources of vessel information are accessible, these offer access to either open or proprietary data that could be used to perform risk analysis on each individual vessel navigating in, or on its way to, European waters.
Traditional reporting systems are not enough by themselves to allow for a reliable detection of anomalies. Therefore, research under this topic should focus on innovative solutions bringing together these three elements: reporting and surveillance systems data (e.g. containing information on a vessel journey), relevant information databases (containing vessels’ and/or containers’ historical information) and real or near real time data resulting from other reporting or surveillance sources. The aim is to provide more precise, more robust and earlier anomaly detection. The combination of these sources of information should produce a risk scoring figure to be assigned to specific vessels which could, in turn, facilitate the discovery of possible illegal activities carried out by those vessels.
The solutions should be based on implementation agnostic, innovative algorithms for artificial intelligence and machine learning, applied to existing ship reporting systems and maritime databases and information sources. These algorithms should exploit, when appropriate and without precluding other methods, the capacity of Artificial Intelligence-enabled solutions. The solutions should automatically allocate risk level to vessels according to risk measured on the basis of anomalies detected on the reporting systems and on a vessel’s previous history. Solutions should also take into account special requirements found when working with very large amounts of data, coming from a wide range of heterogeneous sources.
The fitness for purpose of the proposed solutions should be systematically tested and validated (i.e. planned, implemented, reported and assessed) in a real operational environment at the EU external borders under the control of potential end-users, delivering quantifiable, verifiable and comparable measures of effectiveness and performance. Proposals should recommend concrete approaches for their market uptake, taking into consideration the characteristics of the EU security market, business cases favourable for joint cross-border procurement and possible synergies with EU funding instruments.
Where appropriate, the use of CISE data and services model is encouraged. The research undertaken in previous projects (I2C, TRITON, MARISA..) should not be duplicated.

Proposals addressing other issues relevant to this challenge, based on a sound rationale and with the active involvement of a large number of relevant practitioners are invited to apply under this sub-topic (see eligibility and admissibility conditions.)
Proposals submitted under this topic should be coordinated by a competent authority under civilian authority and command, nationally identified as specialised border or coast guard, or border police force.
They should clearly demonstrate how they complement and do not overlap with actions undertaken in the Preparatory Action on Defence Research under topic PADR-US-01-2017: Technological demonstrator for enhanced situational awareness in a naval environment.[1]
Certain operational costs are excluded from eligible costs (see eligibility and admissibility conditions.)
Proposals should lead to solutions developed in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Medium term:
Innovative solutions validated and qualified in the real, operational environment of civilian missions, defined in detail according to specifications set by the practitioners (authorities in charge of border surveillance and coast guard functions) and tailored to effectively meet their requirements within civilian missions.
Plans for the quick take up of qualified systems at EU level.
Plans for transnational procurement strategies.
Long term:
Improved cost-effectiveness and efficiency of systems for the prevention of cross border crime and for border surveillance for civilian purposes.
European standards for interoperable systems.
Substantial and tangible improvement of (maritime) situational awareness and reaction capability, as appropriate in surveillance for civilian purposes, fight against crime, and search and rescue missions by the National and European Border and Coast Guards.
Contribution to the concept of Common Application of Surveillance Tools, as for the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and to its interoperability with other systems.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A reason for the difficult interaction among practitioners, and for the low levels of interoperability of equipment and procedures implemented by first responders, lies in there being insufficient harmonisation and standardisation, which pre-normative research and demonstrations may address effectively.
The security market in Europe is an institutional market that is highly fragmented (because of the lack of standardization and harmonised certification), and with a strong societal dimension (it directly affects in many ways the citizens). In this context, the Mandate M/487 to Establish Security Standards coordinated by the European Committee for Standardization has clearly recognized the whole field of ""crisis management and civil protection"" as one of the three priorities for establishing standards in the security sector. It has identified the need for crisis management and civil protection standardization activities to facilitate response, effectiveness, efficiency and cooperation as top priorities, especially in what regards to natural hazard emergencies.
Scope:
Proposals are invited to address issues related to pre-standardisation, in particular:
Sub-topic 1: [2018] Pre-standardisation for the security of water supply
For several years research actions have led to the development of detection technologies to analyse drinking water. Based on the legacy of FP7-funded actions, clearer strategies to integrate current technologies in the existing water safety network should be designed. Testing facilities should interconnect the safety- and security-related networks of sensors that are deployed among water supply and distribution networks. The focus of action should be on networking testing facilities developed by water utilities to demonstrate the use of current sensor technologies for the purpose of both safety and security of water, including methods to monitor reservoirs, and sea or river levels for early warning.
Sub-topic 2: [2019] Pre-standardisation in crisis management (including natural hazard and CBRN-E emergencies)
Generally speaking, the development of standards for civil protection in the areas of crisis management (including for systems, tools and services related to natural hazard and CBRN-E emergencies) will increase interoperability of equipment and procedures. Innovation actions should bring validated and positively-assessed practices into standards within or outside current standardisation processes. The involvement of well-established standardisation organisations is required. The complementarity of the proposed activities with activities supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in the CBRN-E area should be described comprehensively.
Sub-topic 3: [2020] First aids vehicles deployment, training, maintenance, logistic and remote centralized coordination means
Improved standards and common communication data exchange mechanisms are required for an effective deployment of resources during the run-up to a major crisis related to any kind of disaster either natural (including resulting from climate-related extremes) or man-made, and immediately after the event, for example in case of a mass evacuation from an urban area. Proposals should target in particular events where there are strong cross-sector, cross-border, cross-hierarchy coordination activities ongoing, and therefore the issue of interoperability. The aim is to pave the way to improved standards, including voluntary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or ISO or EN standards.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this topic is expected to be up to TRL 6 to 7 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Medium term:
[2018] full awareness of water supply facilities about the necessity of designing monitoring networks capable of detecting both contamination risks (safety) and deliberate poisoning (security);
[2019] standards for interoperable equipment and procedures in the area of crisis management and civil protection (including natural hazard and CBRN-E emergencies in support to operations involving international crews;

The involvement of well-established standardisation organisations is required. The complementarity of the proposed activities with activities supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in the CBRN-E area should be described comprehensively.
Sub-topic 3: [2020] First aids vehicles deployment, training, maintenance, logistic and remote centralized coordination means
Improved standards and common communication data exchange mechanisms are required for an effective deployment of resources during the run-up to a major crisis related to any kind of disaster either natural (including resulting from climate-related extremes) or man-made, and immediately after the event, for example in case of a mass evacuation from an urban area. Proposals should target in particular events where there are strong cross-sector, cross-border, cross-hierarchy coordination activities ongoing, and therefore the issue of interoperability. The aim is to pave the way to improved standards, including voluntary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and/or ISO or EN standards.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this topic is expected to be up to TRL 6 to 7 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
A reason for the difficult interaction among practitioners, and for the low levels of interoperability of equipment and procedures implemented by first responders, lies in there being insufficient harmonisation and standardisation, which pre-normative research and demonstrations may address effectively.
The security market in Europe is an institutional market that is highly fragmented (because of the lack of standardization and harmonised certification), and with a strong societal dimension (it directly affects in many ways the citizens). In this context, the Mandate M/487 to Establish Security Standards coordinated by the European Committee for Standardization has clearly recognized the whole field of ""crisis management and civil protection"" as one of the three priorities for establishing standards in the security sector. It has identified the need for crisis management and civil protection standardization activities to facilitate response, effectiveness, efficiency and cooperation as top priorities, especially in what regards to natural hazard emergencies.
Scope:
Proposals are invited to address issues related to pre-standardisation, in particular:
Sub-topic 1: [2018] Pre-standardisation for the security of water supply
For several years research actions have led to the development of detection technologies to analyse drinking water. Based on the legacy of FP7-funded actions, clearer strategies to integrate current technologies in the existing water safety network should be designed. Testing facilities should interconnect the safety- and security-related networks of sensors that are deployed among water supply and distribution networks. The focus of action should be on networking testing facilities developed by water utilities to demonstrate the use of current sensor technologies for the purpose of both safety and security of water, including methods to monitor reservoirs, and sea or river levels for early warning.
Sub-topic 2: [2019] Pre-standardisation in crisis management (including natural hazard and CBRN-E emergencies)
Generally speaking, the development of standards for civil protection in the areas of crisis management (including for systems, tools and services related to natural hazard and CBRN-E emergencies) will increase interoperability of equipment and procedures. Innovation actions should bring validated and positively-assessed practices into standards within or outside current standardisation processes.

Large-scale pandemics constitute an ever growing threat in today's globalized society, given the increasing flows of goods and people among continents. This challenge ought to be addressed internationally, and with the involvement of a large variety of practitioners and stakeholders, from planners in national health systems, to first responders. The Horizon 2020 work programme separately includes an EIC Horizon Prize for 'Early Warning for Epidemics' that is relevant for preparedness and response specifically to vector-borne disease outbreaks.
Scope:
In 2014 an exploratory phase was called for (in DRS4 of the 2014 Call in Societal Challenge 7) to address the feasibility of strengthening capacity-building for health and security protection in case of large-scale pandemics (phase 1). The resulting project has issued a range of recommendations for research gaps to be addressed in priority. It has also proposed innovative concepts to integrate better the existing tools and systems for health and security protection in case of large-scale pandemics, taking into account potential impacts of climate change.
All these recommendations and proposals will be made public on the portal of the Call in due time.
Demonstrations are now required to assess these novel concepts, in support of cross-border emergency approaches (phase 2), to strengthen preparedness and response to pandemics (including the detection of disease outbreaks that could lead to pandemics), in line with Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health[1] and the International Health Regulations (WHO, 2005)[2].
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
Novel concepts for health and security protection in the case of large-scale pandemics, validated by international organisations and a large number of EU Member States including a commitment to sharing these novel concepts.
A prototype IT system integrating innovative tools, and supporting existing emergency frameworks.
An operational strategy for implementation of the concepts and IT system supporting cross-border preparedness and crisis management, and demonstrated in situ.

Technologies and innovations in the field of CBRN are developed by companies which often face difficulties in bringing them to markets. At least three reasons may be identified:
they address local, small niche markets;
these companies have neither the capabilities nor the strategic objective to go for foreign markets;
the individual technologies that they develop can make it to the market only if integrated and combined with other tools by other companies that have the capabilities and the strategy to market products abroad, and possibly on the global market.
In this context a platform has been established further to the response to topic SEC-05-DRS-2016-2017 in 2017. A larger number of innovative technologies, devices and services need to be added to this platform.
Scope:
In 2019 and 2020 the Commission will select several RIAs aiming at research and development of novel CBRN technologies and innovations identified in the catalogue that is updated by the ENCIRCLE project on a regular basis. Each of these actions will be led by an SME. Each consortium implementing such a RIA must not only establish a consortium agreement among its members, but also an agreement with the participants in the ENCIRCLE project which must settle how the results from the RIA will be exploited and integrated into platforms managed by ENCIRCLE.
Where applicable, the complementarity of the proposed activities with activities supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA) should be described comprehensively.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this topic is expected to be up to TRL 4 to 6 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 3.5 million per action for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
The following options of the Model Grant Agreement will be implemented:
Option 1 of Article 41.3 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.

Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Criminals, including terrorists are constantly seeking new ways to develop, deploy and activate dangerous chemicals (explosives, neurotoxins, new drugs, etc.). The way in which such chemicals can be manufactured and combined evolve continuously, which makes the specialized work of law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and reference laboratories in this area a continuous challenge.
Scope:
Research needs to anticipate and match this challenge by increasing the knowledge about these threats; developing technologies to counter and respond to incidents with them, improving knowledge on these dangerous chemicals and increasing deterrence messaging whilst also recognising the need to minimise the inconvenience that security measures place on operators and users of public spaces.
Proposals have to demonstrate how they will effectively build on relevant previous H2020 projects and build synergies with on-going H2020 projects.
Proposals should address only one of the following aspects:
Proposals should focus on the continuation of the work already done on some explosive precursors in previous FP7 and H2020 projects, including; tackling new precursors not yet studied.
Proposals should tackle the chemicals and potentially their precursors in the usage other than explosives and explosive precursors covered under the first point, and propose means to decrease the vulnerability of the public to their malevolent or terrorist use, along the full timeline of a potential criminal/terrorist plot (from early intelligence to the actual attack).
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this topic is expected to be up to TRL 6 to 7 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
Improved knowledge of dangerous chemicals and of their combinations;
Improved effectiveness of the supporting methods and techniques as well as of combinations of technologies used to prevent their use and to detect them before they are used;
Improved mitigation methods, including designing strategies and forensic tools.
Medium/Long term:
Contribution to improving public security;
Factual scientific contribution to policy-makers in order to allow them to make an informed decision;
Stronger involvement of practitioners in the field of counter-terrorist activities in making, assessing and selecting new tools and technologies through reliable management plans.
Improving the training of law enforcement officers in this field and the cooperation at local, national and international level."

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, practitioners interested in the uptake of security research and innovation are dedicated to performing their duty and are focused on their tasks. In general, however, practitioner organisations have little scope to free workforces from daily operations in order to allocate time and resources to monitor innovation and research that could be useful to them. They have few opportunities to interact with academia or with industry on such issues. All stakeholders – public services, industry, academia – including those who participate in the Security Advisory Group, recognize this as an issue.
Scope:
Practitioners are invited to associate in 3 different categories of networks in the field security:
a. [2019-2020] Practitioners (end-users) in the same discipline and from across Europe are invited to get together: 1) to monitor research and innovation projects with a view to recommending the uptake or the industrialisation of results, 2) to express common requirements as regards innovations that could fill capability and other gaps and improve their future performance, and 3) to indicate priorities as regards areas requiring more standardisation. Opinions expressed and reported by the networks of practitioners should be checked against what can be reasonably expected, and according to which timetable, from providers of innovative solutions. In 2019, proposals are invited to address the specific area of handling of hybrid threats in line with the existing EU policy framework.[1].
In 2020 proposals are invited to cover one of the two following options:
Option 1: security and intelligence services
The persistent terrorist threat is becoming increasingly diverse and complex. Emerging technologies add to the threat, but also provide opportunities. Security and intelligence services of EU Member States and Schengen partners are playing an important role to keep European citizens safe. European technological autonomy is particularly important in the field of intelligence. Intelligence and security services may have research needs that are different from law enforcement. Using tools based on cutting edge technology will be key to the performance of the services in the 21st century. Therefore, a network of practitioners from security and intelligence services of EU Member States, Associated Countries and, possibly, Schengen partners would be important to add this specific perspective to the identification of future research needs.
Such a network could focus on interacting with relevant existing H2020 projects to provide input and feedback, on undertaking horizon scanning to identify emerging technologies and potential new threats and on identifying requirements for future research, which could include emerging technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence. In cooperation with the Commission, working methods would be identified to protect the specific requirements of the security and intelligence services participating in the consortium. The objective would be to support the needs of the security and intelligence services of the Member States, Associated Countries for future security research programming.
Option 2: fighting cybercrime
Several initiatives have been launched to identify existing gaps, and law enforcement authorities’ needs in the area of cybercrime, to assess new threats and to develop roadmaps. This work has led to targeted research and development projects. However, in the area of cybercrime, technology and the threats scenarios evolve at such a pace that this work needs continuous updating. An accurate mapping of specific capacities in Member State authorities is still missing. Moreover, as cybercrime and crimes committed online happen without regard to borders it is necessary to identify as far as possible common challenges and solutions, so as to maximise the impact of available resources. As cybercrime investigations and digital forensics require specific expertise and tools (which are also needed for investigating crimes committed online in general), a dedicated network of practitioners, led by law enforcement experts, with a specific focus on cybercrime and more generally on the handling of digital evidence could therefore have a clear added value for assessing needs and gaps that can be tackled by capacity building including through research. In this context, the network could contribute to better prioritising and planning future EU funded research by: 1. Liaising with the relevant stakeholders in order to anticipate future capability needs and gaps in the field of fighting cybercrime; 2. Cataloguing, aggregating, processing and exploiting knowledge about current and future state of the art of technologies which can contribute to filling the capability gaps; 3. Communicating relevant findings to the relevant communities thus providing the required feedback to the research cycle, as well as to other technological capacity building initiatives launched at EU or national level.
b. [2018] Innovation clusters from around Europe (established at national, regional or local level), especially those managing demonstration sites, testing workbenches, and training facilities (including those providing simulators, serious gaming platforms, testing of PPDR applications on broadband networks) are invited to establish one network 1) to establish and maintain a roster of capabilities and facilities, 2) to organise to share expertise, 3) plan to pool and share resources with a view to facilitating access to their respective facilities among collective membership when this would constitute an economy of scale and allow a more intensive use of expensive equipment, and 4) to coordinate future developments and workbenches' acquisition.
c. [2018] Procurement agencies, or departments, active at budgeting and implementing the acquisition of security solutions at European, national, regional or local level can get together: 1) to share investment plans, 2) to compare procurement techniques and rules, and 3) to plan for common procurements of research services as well as of innovative, off-the-shelf products.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of:
about EUR 3.5 million per action for a duration of 5 years (recommended duration) for Parts a) and b);
about EUR 1.5 million per action for a duration of 5 years (recommended duration) for Part c)
would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected Impact:
Medium term:
Common understanding of innovation potential, more widely accepted understanding, expression of common innovation and standardization needs among practitioners in the same discipline.
Greater involvement from public procurement bodies upstream in the innovation cycle.
More efficient use of investments made across Europe in demonstration, testing, and training facilities.
Long term:
Synergies with already established European, national and sub-national networks of practitioners, even if these networks are for the time being only dedicated to aspects of practitioners' work unrelated to research and innovation (in general, to the coordination of their operations).
Delegation Exception Footnote:
For 2018, 2019 and 2020 topics, this activity will be delegated to the Research Executive Agency, nevertheless the Commission reserves the possibility to exclude a specific project from the delegation to the REA if it appears that that project would necessarily have a close link to the development of EU policies in the field of security.

Expected Impact:
Medium term:
Common understanding of innovation potential, more widely accepted understanding, expression of common innovation and standardization needs among practitioners in the same discipline.
Greater involvement from public procurement bodies upstream in the innovation cycle.
More efficient use of investments made across Europe in demonstration, testing, and training facilities.
Long term:
Synergies with already established European, national and sub-national networks of practitioners, even if these networks are for the time being only dedicated to aspects of practitioners' work unrelated to research and innovation (in general, to the coordination of their operations).
Delegation Exception Footnote:
For 2018, 2019 and 2020 topics, this activity will be delegated to the Research Executive Agency, nevertheless the Commission reserves the possibility to exclude a specific project from the delegation to the REA if it appears that that project would necessarily have a close link to the development of EU policies in the field of security.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
In Europe, practitioners interested in the uptake of security research and innovation are dedicated to performing their duty and are focused on their tasks. In general, however, practitioner organisations have little scope to free workforces from daily operations in order to allocate time and resources to monitor innovation and research that could be useful to them. They have few opportunities to interact with academia or with industry on such issues. All stakeholders – public services, industry, academia – including those who participate in the Security Advisory Group, recognize this as an issue.
Scope:
Practitioners are invited to associate in 3 different categories of networks in the field security:
a. [2019-2020] Practitioners (end-users) in the same discipline and from across Europe are invited to get together: 1) to monitor research and innovation projects with a view to recommending the uptake or the industrialisation of results, 2) to express common requirements as regards innovations that could fill capability and other gaps and improve their future performance, and 3) to indicate priorities as regards areas requiring more standardisation. Opinions expressed and reported by the networks of practitioners should be checked against what can be reasonably expected, and according to which timetable, from providers of innovative solutions. In 2019, proposals are invited to address the specific area of handling of hybrid threats in line with the existing EU policy framework.[1].
In 2020 proposals are invited to cover one of the two following options:
Option 1: security and intelligence services
The persistent terrorist threat is becoming increasingly diverse and complex. Emerging technologies add to the threat, but also provide opportunities. Security and intelligence services of EU Member States and Schengen partners are playing an important role to keep European citizens safe. European technological autonomy is particularly important in the field of intelligence. Intelligence and security services may have research needs that are different from law enforcement. Using tools based on cutting edge technology will be key to the performance of the services in the 21st century. Therefore, a network of practitioners from security and intelligence services of EU Member States, Associated Countries and, possibly, Schengen partners would be important to add this specific perspective to the identification of future research needs.
Such a network could focus on interacting with relevant existing H2020 projects to provide input and feedback, on undertaking horizon scanning to identify emerging technologies and potential new threats and on identifying requirements for future research, which could include emerging technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence. In cooperation with the Commission, working methods would be identified to protect the specific requirements of the security and intelligence services participating in the consortium. The objective would be to support the needs of the security and intelligence services of the Member States, Associated Countries for future security research programming.
Option 2: fighting cybercrime
Several initiatives have been launched to identify existing gaps, and law enforcement authorities’ needs in the area of cybercrime, to assess new threats and to develop roadmaps. This work has led to targeted research and development projects. However, in the area of cybercrime, technology and the threats scenarios evolve at such a pace that this work needs continuous updating. An accurate mapping of specific capacities in Member State authorities is still missing. Moreover, as cybercrime and crimes committed online happen without regard to borders it is necessary to identify as far as possible common challenges and solutions, so as to maximise the impact of available resources. As cybercrime investigations and digital forensics require specific expertise and tools (which are also needed for investigating crimes committed online in general), a dedicated network of practitioners, led by law enforcement experts, with a specific focus on cybercrime and more generally on the handling of digital evidence could therefore have a clear added value for assessing needs and gaps that can be tackled by capacity building including through research. In this context, the network could contribute to better prioritising and planning future EU funded research by: 1. Liaising with the relevant stakeholders in order to anticipate future capability needs and gaps in the field of fighting cybercrime; 2. Cataloguing, aggregating, processing and exploiting knowledge about current and future state of the art of technologies which can contribute to filling the capability gaps; 3. Communicating relevant findings to the relevant communities thus providing the required feedback to the research cycle, as well as to other technological capacity building initiatives launched at EU or national level.

","single-stage
Deadline date","Specific Challenge:
Innovative solutions are needed when resources from different countries are required to work more closely together. Such solutions should support the development of the EU’s Security Union.
Scope:
Sub-topic 1: [2018] Common requirements specifications for innovative, advanced systems to support security (CSA)
Practitioners from several countries are invited to work on common requirements of any kind of system that they may need in the future to enhance border and external security, to fight against crime and terrorism, to protect infrastructure, or to make societies more resilient, and to involve their respective procurement bodies in preparing for future acquisitions. Practitioner organisations may be private or public entities.
To ensure that the outcome of this action becomes also available to EU Member State national authorities as well as EU agencies not participating for further procurement purposes, proposals must necessarily state:
(1). Agreement from participating procurement authorities to negotiate, in good faith and on a case-by-case basis, with non-participating procurement authorities that wish to procure a capability or a product fully or partly derived from this action, the use of the information required to run such a procurement process, and solely for that purpose.
(2). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to consult with any legal entity generating information to be released for the purpose set out in paragraph (1), unless contrary to applicable legislation.
(3). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to negotiate the use granted under paragraph (1) on Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The following options of the Model Grant Agreement will be implemented:
- Options on additional exploitation obligations of Article 28.1 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied.
- Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to the grant agreement under Sub-topic 2 of this Topic. The respective options of Article 2, and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement[1] will be applied.
A subset of the domains addressed by the proposals selected for funding by the Commission further to this call will be continued with pre-commercial procurement activities in 2020.
Proposals should lead to solutions to be developed in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner. All participating procurement authorities should also commit to comply with EU data protection legislation in the development of innovative, advanced systems to support security and in particular with the principles of data protection by design and by default.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Sub-topic 2: [2020] Procurement of prototype systems among those specified as a result of Sub-topic 1 (PCP)
The Commission invites practitioners involved in projects funded under Sub-topic 1 to submit proposals for this PCP stage based on requirements resulting from those projects.
Phase 1: To finalise the tendering documents package for a call for tenders to build security-relevant prototypes based on the technical input resulting from Sub-topic 1 of this Topic. To define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP stages;
Phase 2: To implement the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different stages that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;
Phase 3: To conduct the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including, at least, a design stage, an integration and technical verification stage and a validation in real environment stage. This process should be assessed following the procedures for verification and validation defined in the Phase 1;
Phase 4: To consolidate the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extract conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and to define a clear strategy for the further uptake of solutions. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU funds.
Proposals must build on the outcomes of the projects funded under Sub-topic 1. In order to guarantee a successful implementation of the PCP, proposals must provide clear evidence that such projects have delivered concrete outcomes on the following aspects:
- That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives;
- That there is a consolidated group of potential buyers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint-procurement of innovative solutions;
- That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who would be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project;
- That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge;
- That the future PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready on due time in order to launch the call for the acquisition of R&D services according to the PCP rules.
To ensure that the outcome of this action becomes available for further procurement purposes to EU Member State national authorities as well as EU agencies not participating, the proposal must provide evidence of the following:
(1). Agreement from participating procurement authorities to negotiate, in good faith and on a case-by-case basis, with non-participating procurement authorities that wish to procure a capability or a product fully or partly derived from this action, the use of the information required to run such a procurement process, and solely for that purpose;
(2). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to consult with any legal entity generating information to be released for the purpose set out in paragraph (1), unless contrary to applicable legislation;
(3). Commitment from participating procurement authorities to negotiate the use granted under paragraph (1) on Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
The centre of gravity for technology development with actions funded under this subtopic is expected to be up to TRL 8 – see General Annex G of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 12 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Proposals should ensure that solutions will be developed in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data. Societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) have to be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner. All participating procurement authorities should also commit to comply with EU data protection legislation in the development of innovative, advanced systems to support security and in particular with the principles of data protection by design and by default.
Expected Impact:
Short term:
Common requirements for innovative prototypes agreed among the practitioner organisations involved in the action;
Technical tender documents ready for use by subsequent pre-commercial procurement actions, as well as by non-participating procurement authorities;
Common solutions to address urgent security challenges jointly developed, integrated and valuated;
Potential demand for security solutions, inspired by those developed, is aggrevated.
Medium term:
To develop common technical specifications and reference performance levels for joint EU security solutions;
To pave the road to market for technically mature and operationally relevant solutions and to accelerate their wide deployment in the EU.
Long Term:
To contribute to narrowing down the gap between research and the market for the next generation of security solutions;
To contribute to a single EU security market, by reducing market fragmentation and allowing exploitation of economies of scale;
To facilitate access of new innovative players to the public procurement market;
To contribute to reinforcing the competitiveness of the EU technology and industrial base.
Delegation Exception Footnote:
For 2018, 2019 and 2020 topics, this activity will be delegated to the Research Executive Agency, nevertheless the Commission reserves the possibility to exclude a specific project from the delegation to the REA if it appears that that project would necessarily have a close link to the development of EU policies in the field of security.
